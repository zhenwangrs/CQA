What have you done to improve your life lately?	NoFap, studying the bible more working out gaming a little less Getting a job and my permit this summer (I'm 16)	Drinking a lot more water. Now I feel like I have wayyy more energy than always feeling tired all the time and my piss is crystal clear.
My girlfriend of 3 years, and first love, just left me. Guys, how did you deal with your first heart break?	I was 15 when my first girlfriend cheated on me with a one feet shorter than me chinese guy who happened to have a lot of money and paid her for having sex with him... Twice.. Broke my heart, I didn't want to talk to girls for like two years, had a lot of trust issues and it heavily influenced me in my relationship even after those two years. Worst part? She was my classmate, so there was no chance of avoiding her the following year. She failed the class though, which I was kinda glad about.	All I can recommend is time and distraction. Put some more time into your favourite hobby and at some point you'll realise you can do better than someone who cheats on you. I know for now it is hard and it hurts, but it will pass.
Do you like being called sweet? Why or why not?	All the compliments that works on women make me cringe and are not taken as compliments. Kind, sweet, cute, all I hear is "not manly" ie "not attractive." If kindness made the pussy drip our world would be a hippy fucking utopia, but the fact is the weekend warrior gets laid. It's a good way to know a girl isn't interested though. And from that gauge what sort of guy she likes. If you're a skinny guy called hot she likes skinny guys, if she calls you sweet and kind you can bet your non existent ass she likes muscular guys with a cheeky attitude.	*"Sweet? Where do you get off? Where do you get sweet? I am dark and mysterious, and pissed off! And I could be very dangerous to all of you! You should know that about me... I am the enemy!"*
Askmen, what popular movie in your opinion espouses the wrong idea of masculinity?	Star Wars 7 has really struck me at this. I left the movie thinking that almost non of the male characters displayed a real human but always just aspects, really flat parts of what masculinity can be. On the other hand Rey is presented more like a male than a female as if it was impossible to be a strong and powerful character with the capability to change the universe for the better as a real female character. Had the impression that (in the eyes of whoever ruined the franchise) masculinity equals either power or unproductive uselessness, while women could only be either manly to be powerful or useless grieving women like Lea I really did not enjoy that movie it left me very uncomfortable with the taste of some artifical nonsense pressed into something i held dear as a child.	The Wolf of Wall Street. That movie is like some kind of a test. There were guys I know who came out of the theatre wanting to be Belfort, and there were others who went home and suddenly didn't feel so bad about their unexciting jobs and their plain wives. To this this day I'm still torn on it. EDIT: Spelled his name wrong.
Unmarried straight men: How much do you fear impregnating a lady?	I am one of the apparently rare abstinence types. I'd just like to reserve that level of intimacy for marriage. So, zero fear of impregnating a lady. :) Maybe it's not for everyone, but I'm 21 and the quality of my intercourse-less life has been pretty stellar so far.	I wouldn't entrust my sexual health and financial well-being to a woman who expects me to believe she's on birth control just because she says so. Wrap up.
Why does/doesn't a girl calling you "daddy" bother you?	Dominance. Any guy that claims not to like it is either lying or likes pegging. Edit: please downvote more. I added one.	How often does this happen IRL? I have never encountered it but it seems to come up in conversations on reddit a whole lot. Not sure I would mind, it's pretty naughty.
Bisexual men: are men better than women at hand and mouth stuff?	from my personal experience and from what i've heard from my female friends, men are just better performers than women in the sack. Women are nice when i want to hold something soft and nice smelling but ya'll are lazy (less movement in general) and weak (grip and endurance) compared to men. be thankful you got more squeaky toys strapped to your bodies.	Being women, they only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what? Thirty, forty-five minutes a week? And that's on a good week. How can they be expected to have the same expertise as people who own this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives?
How can women be better advocates and more supportive of men's mental health?	They won't ever be able to. Women do not and cannot understand weakness in men. It is a massive turnoff. It's just the way they're wired. Men are not supposed to cry about things just suffer in silence. If you think I'm wrong just listen to all the stories of men who "opened up" to their significant other. It doesn't end well. Bare in mind I am not shitting on women here nor saying men don't deal with these issues. But men should never open up to women about these things, or anyone for that matter. Seek therapy, deal with your issues, and move forward.	If a man opens up to you, try and be completely non-judgmental. It's hard for men to be vulnerable, and often even harder to do it in front of women- we're meant to be the supportive, strong ones and all that gender role stuff. People are stigmatising themselves in their head even as they open up. Sometimes women shy away from men who are vulnerable which perpetuates this. Be mindful of that, and be kind and listen. They've had to make this leap and try and trust you, so repay that as much as you can. You're only one person, you're not a therapist- always remember your boundaries when you're supporting anyone. But being kind and accepting can really help. It means a lot.
Have you found girls can be pretty laid back about condoms?	My boyfriend was more eager to drop condoms than I was. I've consistently been on the pill for years now and getting pregnant still worries me. I want to possibly get an IUD but I'm worried about potential side effects.	I'm always worried in the back of my head about the chicks who say "oh go ahead, no need to use a condom". Unless I know and trust you I'd prefer condom. For me it's about 50%.
How would you feel if a girl insists on using condoms that she brought?	I'd be a little confused if there wasn't an explanation, but alergies to latex is a perfectly understandable one. I guess I would only care then if it didn't fit well (I know which brand works well for me). Since I am not a child the idea of you poking holes in the condom wouldn't come up. How would you do it without puncturing the wrapping? It's not like I would use one that was already opened. Gah, sorry, those kinds of guys give the rest of us a bad name.	Unless I see red flags I'd have a hard time imagining the girl wants to get pregnant. What's her plan using me next, will she even find me? If she adds in her allergies issues that will be perfect. Paranoid me could offer something like "it's the dude's responsibility to provide male contraception. Please show me what brands work for you, I'll get a box. Okay, I bought that, does it work?"
How many of you got shafted on father's day?	Sounds like the mother in the house made her expectations clear. Did you also make your expectations clear? Did you state that you expected breakfast in bed? Or did you just kinda shrug and go "I don't care" and then get pissy when people treated it as something you didn't care about?	At my work, on mother's day weekend they sent out a nice email, bought us pizza both days and gave a flower to each mother on shift for mothers day. This weekend there was no email, no pizza, nothing at all. I thought that was pretty fucked up.
Boy-trying-to-be-a-man here, my parents are pressuring me into getting a first job and I am seriously dreading it. What are some good first jobs or, alternatively, some advice that could help me be more prepared for this?	Ask your parents for help in finding a job. Maybe a friend has a business? Many people say they just wish young job seekers would show up the second day. Construction and garden work is hard and out in the elements, but invariably they are looking for people to work. Do you have a school counselor? I know, it's the wrong part of the year, but school will start soon. One of the first things you should do is check in with them. Like others have said, you can always quit if you don't like it.	I was where you were at before, I bet almost everyone was, I did not want a job at first, it felt like just another responsibility to eat up my free time, but having money allowed me to buy a car, and have money always, I made a few good friends and it was all in all a good experience. But finding a first job you enjoy is borderline impossible, there is a reason kids can’t get jobs that pay good wages, and you’ll end up doing something kind of shitty
Guys, how much detail do you tell your guy friends about girls after you've had sex with them?	I usually share with them if the girl was exceptionally hot, or someone we all know. Btw, I don't believe a damn soul in this thread that says they don't share. Believe what you want, but guys share, just like girls do.	I have some bottom-of-the-barrel degenerate friends, and I don't hear details like this from them. Worst I will get is unsolicited stories on technique. Women should understand that we know how each other's minds work, and most of us don't want friends imagining a girl we respect even the slightest in that way. In the very rare situations that friends have shared sex stories, it's usually about women they have no respect for and don't plan to see more than once or twice.
Would you be offended if your SO said they didn't want your genes in their future children?	If I had a SO that said that to me, I would be beyond livid. It is an extremely insulting thing to say. In your specific case, she might have a point. However, I think that, with anxiety and depressive disorders, a lot of it involves the environment a child is raised in. If you two are emotionally stable enough to raise adoptive children in a stable, loving family, then biological children shouldn't be too much of an issue.	I think she was making a small joke in passing. Not being serious. But, yes, I would be deeply offended if someone told me they thought I was so flawed that I should not pass on my genes.
In the spirit of Halloween, what is the scariest experience you have ever had?	In the 30th trimester my mother after a particularly long arduous day at work came home to inform me that I was about to be aborted. I've gone swimming with a flotation device holding me under water before, I've been hiking and seen a baby bear about 50 meters away. These are probably a lot more dangerous, but even so.	The one night i was so tired that i slept with the door open and had my first encounter with sleep paralysis that night. 2 for 1 baby
She slept with someone before the "exclusive" talk and just told me. How would you handle it?	People are gonna fuck man, how can you expect someone to be faithful after 3 weeks of "talking everyday". If you want someone to stay faithful you talk about it right off the bat.	Between the recent big breakup, the self-harm, and the new drinking habits, it's not clear to me that she's ready for dating. Also, you have to pay for everything and drive everywhere, and now she gets bored and bangs other dudes. I mean, I'm probably a lot older than you, but I would have zero patience for any of that. Do what you want, but I suspect you could do way better than what you've got here.
Stolen from r/askwomen. When did you realise you were wrong about a big issue? When did you realise it?	Anime and Manga.I used to respect it as an art form but nowadays half of them are borderline child pornography. The people who draw the girls are not right in the head.	I didn’t believe in gay rights due to being in private school during my early years. I realized how wrong I was when I figured out I was gay during high school.
What's an unusual quality you look for in a girl?	Extreme level of fitness. I want a woman who's strong as shit, fast as shit and fucking *knows* it. I want a women confident enough in herself to walk outside in a fucking sports bra and yoga shorts and OWN that shit. I hate the timidness and nervousness present in most women.	If she's comfortable with silence. I sometimes just don't talk, or don't feel the need to talk, or don't want to talk. They have to be comfortable with a quiet guy. If they talk a lot, that's fine. They'll have my undivided attention. I just don't always feel the need to respond or say something if I don't have anything to add.
How different did a vagina feel than how you imagined it?	I didn't really have any built up expectations, but I was surprised by the amount of texture and how much her period blood and juices together made my skin feel warm and tingle, almost like hot sauce burning me light enough that it didn't feel like pain per se.	Very different. Above all: - The wetness. I mean, sure, I knew girls get "wet", but the first time we were making out naked, I was astonished at *how* wet she gets, just completely drenched. - The heat. I hadn't imagined it to feel so much warmer than, say, the skin on her arm or her belly. - The softness. While "silky soft" is probably one of the better analogies, it really doesn't do it justice. "Vagina" should be the top value on the international softness scale. - The little contractions. Whenever I am inside her, her vagina gives these erratic, tiny little clenches, without rhyme or rhythm to them. The first time I experienced that, it was a "whoa! it's alive!" moment.
If you could be 100% honest with her right now, and she'd not feel any hurt at all, what who would it be and what would you say?	My friend, I'll tell her that she is not an introvert like she would like to say on social media often. She has a squad of friends they travel often even internationally eats out at public restaurants and so on, my brother is a introvert, he struggles to connect to people at any level but he is a terrific guy. I would tell her that I care for her and that if she needs help there are plenty of licensed mental health professionals who would be much helpful than the Tiktok influencers she follows about introvert challenges	"You're really good at making yourself unhappy, and much of it is avoidable. You're my friend so I really don't like seeing you unhappy. You should go back to therapy and work on treating yourself better."
How do you handle a crush on a co-worker?	I live with her and she's driving me up the wall. I'm in the same boat you are buddy except I'm her boss and she's only 18. Honestly I'd just find another job or get a girlfriend if I was you.	Sounds like you know she isn’t available. So get over it? Edit: sorry, that’s a tad cold. I’ve had a crush on someone unavailable before. It’s unhealthy. The only thing you can do is be honest with yourself about the situation and move past it. Don’t view her as an option unless she approaches you in the future. And don’t set yourself up to be approached in hopes she will. You move on.
How aware are you of your own attractiveness?	It's fluctuating. Sometimes I'm aware, sometimes I really don't get why women find me attractive in a context where I really don't find myself attractive (bad picture, looking like shit after a rough night, etc.)	No idea. Eventually, I just gave up and concluded that when people said I wasn't unattractive, they lacked enough motive to be lying.
Men who have significantly reduced their time spent gaming, what are your recommended activities or hobbies to do instead of gaming?	Things that you can replace gaming with. 1) Get a job. 2) Join a sports team. 3) Start a band. 4) Develop any hobby that takes you out of your own house. 5) Replace video/computer gaming with face to face board/card gaming with friends. 6) Monetize your gaming--turning your hobby into work by becoming a game journalist, streamer, etc., can kill it pretty quickly if you work at it. 7) Start dating a non-gamer. 8) Become a parent.	Get a job. There's almost no way you can play 12 hours of games a day if you work 40 hours a week.
Your SO gets a full printout of your porn viewing history. Do you have any chance of not being single by the end of the day? Why or why not?	The better question is does she have any chance of not being single by the end of the day. Why she care about my porn history. I can’t stand women that get caught up on the past or women that act like porn is a form of cheating.	A printout? I suspect for many guys (in the perfect age window of having hit puberty while internet porn was so available and having lived that way for years and years into adulthood), they'd be single if only because their significant other is now fatally buried under all the paper it took to print out their entire history of porn consumpton.
In your opinion , do you wish you postponed having children to a later age , or would of you started having children at a younger age ..and why ?	The world is overpopulated as it is. You should adopt. Your age is more or less irrelevant. If you are financially stable and ready for adoption your application process will reflect that.	Father at nineteen. I love my son to death, but I should have waited. Wrong woman to have a kid with. Couldn't really be the dad I wanted because I couldn't really provide for him without the education I couldn't get at the time.
What's an old trend you refuse to drop despite it being "out of fashion"?	When I was in high school and before most girls realised that trends are shit and classic dress always wins out in the end: Dressing nicely and taking pride in appearance. I will almost always choose to wear a nice collared shirt, with a pair of nice dark jeans/nice pants, and suitable footwear while also making sure my hair is in a classic good looking style kept short and brushed over to one side. Apparently though a nice woolblend pullover that matches a collared shirt well makes you look gay...good thing I'm not after teenage girls.	Professional wrestling. It had broad mainstream appeal in the late 90's but it's popularity has been declining for a decade. Despite being 27, living with a long term SO and having a career in fashion, I still love the theatrics, athleticism and over the top story telling as much as I did as a kid.
Men 50+. Does your partner still give you blow jobs?	50 plus??? Are you kidding? That is so long ago I barely remember her name, but she had great attitude, skill and what more can I say without getting into spank territory? Your ideas about when age and decrepitude arrive need revising, Kid.	61 M wife is 63. Head, yes. BJ to completion...been a long time. And she will not let me go down on her, major body image issues.
What random/non-sexual/innocent things does your SO do that you find super adorable?	My boyfriend often kisses my belly as in me being pregnant (but im not and i have a flat abs). But he always says he wants to kiss our future baby long before he/she will be concieved just to make he/she feel even more welcomed into this world. I find it adorable!	She likes to pick me up and carry me around. There's little difference between us in size (I'm only 1.5 inches taller and 12 lbs heavier) and she can carry me with ease just as I can to her. At weekends we have a day were one of us carries the other down stairs in the morning and upstairs to bed at night. Saturdays I carry her, Sundays she carries me.
What are some great bachelor party ideas that do not include strip clubs or gambling?	All the bachelor parties that I've been to that didn't involve strippers, drugs, gambling or all the above were hella lame.	The vast majority of the bachelor parties I've enjoyed that weren't the two you mentioned were the boys all just getting a cabin somewhere, being in nature chopping wood and making a bonfire and grilling meat and enjoying the seclusion from the outside world
Who is the sexiest girl you know, and what makes her so sexy?	My SO is so fucking sexy. This could be my opinion but she gets hit on a lot so I dont think I'm an outlier. She is Mexican but looks exotic. Big fake boobs that look real (I insulted her on our first date by accident not knowing her tits are fake) and she fucks like a pornstar. Anyone who has heard the song "Foreign" by Trey Songz will know what I'm talking about. Edit: haha I accidentally wrote tots instead of tits. Don't make me choose between them Reddit, I love them both.	A former employee who worked for me about 8 or 9 years ago when she was in college. She's beautiful, long black hair, beautiful greenish brown eyes, incredible legs. She has an incredibly sexy walk, I'm a sucker for a certain walk that not many woman have but she certainly does. Mentally she's also incredible; very intelligent, passionate, caring and introspective. She opted to teach in a high school with mostly poor students who have been written off and she cares that her students succeed, she's bought tablets for them to use in class, paid for clothes for a kid who was thrown out of her foster home and still has time to go on funny rants about Oscar red carpet interviews and the like. She also has just enough crazy to be interesting. She's just the complete package physically, mentally and psychologically.
Men who went from receiving zero attention from the opposite gender to doing decently well, what steps did you take to improve your situation?	Got rich. And figured out it’s a numbers game. You talk to 10 girls, 1-3 on a good day might respond positively. Talk to 100 girls, that’s 10-30 who might respond positively. Being in shape and funny really helps to, and haveing a big dick is icing on the cake. And if they say no or make fun of you who cares? Best they says yes, worse they say is no. It’s not like your gonna get aids by getting turned down lol	* Shaved my head. Balding looks ugly, being bald is a look. * Lost fat. I've just slowly gotten leaner over my adult life * Gained muscle. Nearly a decade in the military helped here but I'm fairly big for a non lifter * Got older. 20 year old girls want a certain type, 30 year old women want a different type. I've always been more of the latter so age has done wonders for me. * Dated a really hot chick for nearly a year. This does wonders for your confidence, self image, etc. * Got diagnosed with cancer. This might sound odd but it did wonders for mentally. My entire outlook on life is changed. I'm happier, I live a fuller life, etc. I don't even need to say anything about cancer, it's just my life choices now make me more attractive.
For those of you who grew up with a single mom or without a male presence in your life, in what ways do you think you are "different" than the average guy?	Honestly? Not in a positive fashion, but that's mostly who they were, they were not, by definition, bad people, I just noticed certain things people did in a colder light as I grew up, I was usually incredibly doubtful of anything said that didn't hold up well in my books and in social situations I end up considering it as a lie on the spot.	My brother and I were raised by my mother. Although my father was involved, he lived elsewhere. I saw him every other weekend or so. Being raised in the way that I was made my standards for a romantic partner quite a bit higher than most people's. My mother managed to raise my brother and i without being dependent on anyone, and she's a former gang banger, so she wasn't weepy and emotional. I expect women to be emotionally resilient and independent...I cannot date someone needy or overly sensitive..it just comes off as childish, because my mom and grandma are some of the strongest people I know. If my grandma could survive and leave an abusive marriage and raise my mom, who raised two men alone in abject poverty, I have zero emotional bandwidth for you crying because I left the toilet seat up or went somewhere without you.
Has your SO ever asked you something, out of mere curiosity, which made you feel insecure?	I asked my bf if he watches porn and it was like pulling teeth getting him to answer! I LOVE porn, he knows this info.... He does, he says, but why he's embarrassed, I'll never know	Not my SO yet, but on our 1st date she asks whether I've been in a relationship before, and then when I say no she asks why not. Shit made me so insecure and nervous.
I 19[f] want to wait until marriage. Will any guy ever want to date me?	> being a virgin until marriage is a horrible idea that just sets everyone up for failure because the couple does not understand their sexual compatibility (I can understand this but I don't know if its always true). It *is* always true. How can you understand your sexual compatibility if (a) you have never had sex, and therefore don't know what you like, and (b) you have never had sex with your partner, so you don't know if he meets your needs? Plus for a relationship as serious as marriage, he should not only meet your needs but should be the perfect fit for them. Personally I would never date someone with your beliefs, but I'm sure you can find some guys who would.	You've made a choice that will limit your dating pool. Look for guys with a similar value set. They're out there. But don't waste your time with guys who want premarital sex, mmmkay?
How am I supposed to reply to "Yeah," "😂😂😂," and other texts that don't really push the conversation forward?	As a girl, I'll just give my personal advice. Don't. Just don't reply. When I respond to a message with a generic such as an emoji or an Lol, it means the conversation has come to and end. Sometimes guys will desperately attempt to carry on and it's aggravating. I just simply don't respond...	On Monday morning march to her locker and say "hey, do you want to go to homecoming with me?" I know it's scary but that's how you've got to do it.
Had sex with a girl and didn't call her again. Found out she was upset and feel ashamed. How should I move forward?	Unless you've been clearly expressing the wish to start a relationship, she isn't entitled to one. I would just tell her "Listen, I'm sorry I didn't meet your expectations but I thought we were on the same page. Hurting you was the last of my intentions, I'd be happy to see you again as a friend but if you don't want to I'll understand."	She had sex with you without a commitment. You don't owe her anything more than to be polite and maybe don't tell many other people.
Men, what incompatibilities do you think are okay to have in a relationship and what are not?	It's not OK if one of you is awake and the other is not. I mean that in a Buddhist sense.	Different taste in music: easy difficulty Different taste in food: medium difficulty Different taste in humor: hard difficulty Different values: legendary difficulty
Would you take male contraception? Why?	Nope, I don't like the idea of chemicals fucking with my sperm I doubt I would ever take it, but would certainly wait 10+ years to check for eventual side effects	Yes. She's stopped taking the pill because we had concerns about it affecting her mental health. I would absolutely take it once I'm happy about the extent of the side effects. Condoms suck.
What was the most unusual way you have gotten hit in the balls?	I kicked a soccer ball. And I was kicking it to my left so I was kinda doing a swinging kick motion. So my balls were victims of centripetal force and hit against my leg. It hurt	An ex said "think fast" and tossed a football. She was a terrible thrower so I was like "huhwhaaAAAAAUUUGGGHH" and cried for 20 minutes. She ended up kissing it better though so it was all good.
After good sex do you guys keep thinking about it the next day?	I can and do still think about the few times in my life when women have said nice things to me. I wonder if I'd think about anything else ever again if sex ever happened.	If by the next day, you mean the next 50 years, then yes. Good sex goes straight to my mental spank bank, where it will be stored until I die or get dementia.
Is it okay for me to buy my boyfriend new underwear?	>"Hey your underwear has holes in it, didn't you notice?" >"I don't buy new clothes, I don't care." What a fucking slob.	You're his girlfriend, tell him you want him to wear them for you and it makes his ass/package look great. Tell him it's an early Christmas gift for yourself.
What hint did you actually pick up on?	None. PSA to women, stop doing this shit and getting mad when we don't see you like us. No one understands. Just say what you mean.	I asked her what she was up to and she said she was cleaning her room and sent me a pic of her in her underwear with a messy room. Been trying to fuck this girl for legit two years. Got the hint and headed there. Lets just say good friday 2013 was abso-fucking-lutely a GREAT friday
How do you feel about other men who have been or want to be with your girlfriend?	This sounds a bit like - am I too jealous? A few things I have learned is that your wife has a past you are not entitled to judge or blame her for, it is unalterable and your relationship goes forward to an unknowable future. How well she cleaves to you and rejects other attention is - if you are wise - also her business. You also have little control over how attractive she is to other men and how they respond. Assuming she doesn't actively flirt and flaunt her sexuality you have no complaints or worries.	If I'm honest I get a little jealous about it but I recognize it's my issue and try not to put that shit on her. I've had some. . . rough experiences with women that make trust a little hard to come by.
What do you think makes a woman "high" or "low" maintenance?	I hate high maintenance. The finer points being "low"...... ...not spending an hour getting ready to go out. ...if your outside at an event and it starts to rain, she doesnt complain about her hair getting wet, ruining her makeup, or running to hide in the car. ...being able to think for herself, and figure out her own life without handholding. ...not holding herself to stupid standards, like needing the newest purse, or only wearing certain brands.	It's about demands and personality traits that inconvenience/impact you. A low maintenance person will not inconvenience, burden, or impact their SO with their behavioral quirks or desires. A high maintenance person will make it a point to inconvenience, burden, or impact their SO with their behavioral quirks or desires. The world revolves around high maintenance people in their mind and IT BETTER REVOLVE AROUND THEM IN YOUR MIND TOO OR ELSE! Pretend your SO is a vegetarian. A high maintenance SO will insist that you cannot have meat in the house nor eat meat in front of her nor be near her if you smell of it. A low maintenance SO will do none of that and will even go to a steakhouse with you so long as they have vegetarian selections.
Is non-exclusivity the default status during dating?	Yes, non-exclusivity is the default, and the default stands until there is conversation where exclusivity is discussed in plain English and both parties agree.	If it is, this is a new thing. I've only seen this assumption floating around in the last few years. To me, this just seems like a particularly weasel-like way to obtain cart-blanche for philandering in the early stages of a relationship. I'd never date anyone who thought this was okay. The *default* for me is exclusivity, and really, if in doubt doesn't that seem like the more honest choice?
Men, when did you realize the girl you were interested in wasn't for you?	I just wanted her to shut her dumb mouth. them I realized that while my feelings for her were real they were more about just being in a relationship for the first time then anything about her. so I did what an adult does in a two month relationship and stopped answering when she called.	When we'd been together a year and she hadn't opened up even a little. It was like being in love with a brick wall.
(NSFW) Do you prefer tits or ass? and why?	I can't pick just one. For years I have been an ass man. Always dated women with smaller tits and a great ass. Then the switch flipped. My recent ex had smaller boobs and not much of an ass, but all of the sudden she went from a small B to DDD's in a matter of 6 months. I then became a tit guy for a while. I'm on the fence. Depends on the gal.	Ass with no tits beats tits with no ass every day In general perky B cups with a nice butt are perfff
So I've been single for 8 years and sexless for over 10 years, it's having a huge effect on me mentally. How do you deal with this and stay confident/happy?	Focus on yourself and stop thinking about women and sex. Try to improve your life, your body or learn something you couldn't do before. Try something new that makes you proud of yourself. After a while you will become happy with your life which leads to confidence... and that's when a woman will come into your life naturally without even trying.	Thank you for posting this. I've been feeling very abandoned and alone lately for a same/similar situation, but I didn't know how to ask Reddit. This reading this post helps me feel a little less shitty from reading the comments. Thanks OP, thanks /r/AskMen
How good does it feel to make a comment watching a sports game and then a second later hearing the announcer say the same exact thing?	Not that great because announcers are usually idiots. You only know this if you used to play the sport you are watching at a high level	I know basketball so that happens enough when I watch that. It feels good. It just verifies that you know what you’re talking about.
Why is there a big push for women to be in STEM fields but not for more blue collar options?	feminists want more women in easy, inside, air conditioned office jobs making lots of money. Thy see outside, hot, manual labor physically demanding jobs as beneath women. Cause men.	In general we tend not to push anyone towards blue collar work. This is slowly changing with the whole unemployed college graduate with a lot of debt thing, but for the most part people are pushed to do white collar jobs.
Guys over 25 - do you find yourself comparing your life with friends from school?	I am the person people compare themselves to. I'm not trying to brag but after years of dedication and hard work I landed a great high paying job, bought a house, bought a dog, got engaged and bought a brand new BMW. This was all in the last 1 1/2 years. I believe I'm a nice guy, and genuinely will do anything to help anyone. I smile a lot and try to make everyone feel happy. It fills me with pride to know I'm doing well in my own life and it makes me feel even prouder when I can help some body else. I'm 26.	Everyone asks each other what you do. That's pretty standard question for someone that you haven't seen in forever. Most people at my age (25) though aren't concerned with success as much as they're afraid they're going to end up old and alone with 50 cats. I'm at the age when the first round of people in my cohort are getting engaged and married
Men, how much sharing of your sex life by your SO with their friends would upset you?	Here's what she's sharing: anything that isn't overly embarrassing to her. She's probably sharing just about everything else which is worth mentioning and there's nothing you can really do about it.	I have to admit that I get really irritated at women that share intimate details about me with their friends. I just don't understand it as I would personally never share any kind of information about the "bedroom activities". I'm also a very private person, so it might be mostly that. Plus there are some things about me that I feel very insecure about, so the less the lady I'm seeing shares, the better. In my understanding women do this more than men and I personally never understood why. Maybe some of the ladies here could explain why they feel the need to share those intimate details about their sex life with their friends?
Guys of Reddit with hot girlfriends, how do you deal with all the sleazes that hit on her regularly and how does it make you feel?	I met her last year. I'm 25 she's 25. She was a virgin and everyone tried to get with her but she turned them all down because she wanted them to wait a while to bang her and they weren't up for the challenge. She's been that pedestal girl in the community that was the perfect partner and wife because she was beautiful, smart, and had a class. Now I have her. When guys hit on her I don't even need to step in. She just tells them like it is and they are on their way. Can confirm she was virgin before I fucked her because my dick would not fit for the first week of trying every day.	I smile and carry on. If she's gonna cheat, ain't much I can do to stop it. I'd rather have a girl that chooses to be with me, than one who requires constant intervention just to keep her attention. Also, I don't date wimps. If a douchecanoe in the bar needs to be glassed, she'll handle it.
What is the hottest non-sexual act a girl can do?	When they are not smoking a cigarette. Once they put up a cigarette I don't care how attractive they are, it's a No from me	State where she wants to eat with neither hesitation nor delay. In theory, at least, that would be hot AF.
Men of Reddit, for those of you who are introverted & considered good looking how has this combination been both a blessing & curse ?	That’s me. I’m glad I’m good looking because i would never have gotten laid if I just relied on my personality. The problem has been that I kinda just went along with women who were into me and made the first moves and who had more of a forward personality. I wasn’t as selective as I should have been and I ended up resentful a lot of times. Now I’m unhappily married and feel stuck because we have kids. Advice: be selective. There will always be another one around the corner. Force yourself to go outside your comfort zone. Watch Charisma on Command on you tube and work on yourself. Good luck!	It's hard for me to read signs and signals if someone is interested in me. Like I can tell blatant flirting. But subtle hints or clues I sometimes miss. Sometimes it's a blessing that I do but I regret the ones that I'm interested in so I just learned to go For it if I'm feeling it.
What are super introverted people supposed to do if they actually go to a bar/out alone?	I'd suggest not trying to meet people like that if it makes you uncomfortable. There are plenty of other ways to meet people.	Watch the TV that's on. Chat with the bartender and anyone else that's watching what you're watching. Play music on the box and see if anyone else is into it. Play a game of darts or pool and if anyone asks to join you, let them. Just enjoy yourself and be willing to allow others to join in if they're wlling
So I was out with this girl I've been seeing and I left in the middle of it (I'm 28M). Full story is in the thread. Can you help me decide if I made the right decision to leave?	Whoa, whoa, whoa! We know nothing about this girl, and you guys already have your pitchforks sharpened and torches lit! Does she have any level of social anxiety? She ducked into the bathroom with her roomie, and her roomie was probably in there talking her down. Had this been some SAP who made a meme about it, the hivemind would be saying things like, "there's nothing wrong with social anxiety" or "If she doesn't understand your challenges, GTFO!" The fact is that we have one side of the story. His side...which may or may not be the whole story. Based on that side, they weren't exclusive, so there shouldn't be any issue. A bit of a dick move? Yep...but at least you paid for the drinks.	>I'm not usually a dick like that, so I feel guilty just getting up and leaving. She fucking bailed and went and hid in the bathroom to avoid the two of you. You did fine.
How would you feel about a woman wanting to masturbate before sex?	I don’t think that I would want to sleep with someone who couldn’t orgasm with their partner(s). I’d probably pass.	Sounds like a reasonable request. Throw it at the bedroom wall, and see if it sticks. If it was me, I'd enjoy watching her get herself off. Alternatively, take the time to teach him how to get you off via masturbation. When the woman cums first, it takes a lot of performance pressure off the guy to not cum too early. A lot more time enjoying the sensations and alot less time thinking of baseball stats.
People who screwed up a relationship with a good partner, what's your story and what would you have changed?	I tried to turn her into a stronger person than she is. She has mental issues and I'm learning about Dom/sub life. It isn't just in the bedroom. It's every part of a couples life. The Dom makes important choices for the sub. Not a controlling asshole, which I don't want to be, but love based. The Dom gets fulfillment. Which I did. I think like a parent does whats best for a child. I tried to make her independent. She is not. She even commented once that she needs someone, like me to tell her things. I miss her.	My first "normal" relationship. She lifted me up. Raised my self esteem. So much that I began to get interest from other women. I broke up with her to pursue others... She met someone else pretty quickly, got pregnant, married, etc, as did I, but I shouldn't have hurt her like I did.
What's the biggest misunderstanding between men and women in our society?	That men want really skinny women. All my girl friends go on and on about how hard it is to meet up to this skinny standard of magazines and movies. And all except one of my guy friends couldn't give less of a shit. They would much rather have some boobs/ booty and a little tummy over some twig any day!	That they're somehow in competition with each other. Any time one side says they have it bad, the other side has to come out to say how they're wrong and they have it so much worse. It's like we're still in kindergarten playing boys vs girls on the playground.
What is a (Harsh) truth about an ex you found out during or after the relationship?	That she was a massive introvert and wasn't going to change. We had very similar senses of humor, we had similar interests, and I thought she was incredibly attractive, but she was also immensely shy and quiet around people she didn't know. I kind of hoped that if I took her out more, she might come out of her shell, but after almost a year, I figured out that that was not going to happen.	Textbook Alcoholism. We were together short of 6 months and we never actually had full on PIV because she was always too drunk and I didn't want to "dead fish" my GF. Granted I was in college and bartending at the time, so it's not like I was some kind of saint, but yeah, she was off the tracks. Also, one time when she was wasted she blurted out "I used to be chunky, but I smoked meth for about 18 months and I lost a bunch of weight and but got to keep these big tits".
i am thinking of quitting Facebook. People who don't use Facebook/social media how has your life been changed?	I'm 29 years old. I have never and will probably never have a Facebook account. I don't really miss it. There are so many other ways to reach out to friends and family. I haven't really felt compelled to get an account.	I heavily reduced my usage of social media this last January. I'll tell you, it has been a tremendous change for the better. I maybe only log on to Facebook and Twitter once a week. Here is what I have experienced: 1. My relationships and bonds with people are stronger, because we communicate in real life. 2. I am not glued to my phone constantly, which makes days more enjoyable and fulfilling. 3. I'm not comparing myself/my achievements to others'. 4. Social media has the potential to be a powerful tool, however, I have found many people care entirely too much about it. Those are the main ones I can think of now. I recommend at least significantly reducing usage. It has been a great experience and feeling for me, and I'm sure you will find similar results.
How do I teach my daughter to respect herself?	> is targeted towards attracting boys and not what she wants to wear just to feel good. What if successfully attracting boys makes her feel good?	Don't tell her "oh some boys like small butts" or anything like that, whatever you do. Help her find other ways to feel good about herself. Help her find things she's good at and praise her for them. Make a point of that, giving her positive reinforcement for what she does, not how she looks, because girls get too much of one and not enough of the other and it can really fuck with their self-image.
Guys of Reddit, what question do you wanna ask other guys?	This is a great thread seeing how I'm banned from creating new ones from this sub for some reason (oops). Why am I only attracted to skanks? Last few girls I've been interested have turned out horribly, one getting finger banged by a friend behind a water tower, another I dated an ex-con after me and turned to a life of drugs, and another girl I'm interested in turned out to be a stripper. I've been on dates with "normal" girls but it just seems boring. They have their shit together but there's no excitement or attraction. My brain says GO FOR THIS ONE! But my dick says no. And my heart is dead due to failed previous relationships.	Never mind I just realized this is what the entire subreddit is. Edit: what the fuck guys? I said nevermind.
Whats the most embarrasing thing youve ever got away with hiding from everyone?	I regularly visit prostitutes. That in itself isn't such a big hoo-hah, but I deliberately only visit the very low-end ones, who are always surprised why a guy like me would go to them, because clearly I'm out of their league. The more obvious the difference in looks is, the better. I guess I like the feeling of being genuinely wanted, or at least I want a more genuine-looking illusion of it. If I went to some hot bimbo, she couldn't make me believe that she genuinely wants me, and I'd probably have a shitty time.	I peed my pants at work once. I had a bad, bad cold, and started coughing really badly. I made it to the rest room, but one final cough was the last straw... I peed. And in pants that really, really showed it. There was no way to hide it. After a minute or two of panic, I turned on the sink and splashed water ALL OVER the front of me, totally soaking myself from bosom to knees. Then I ran out of the bathroom yelling that the faucet had sprayed me when I turned it on. My boss apologized, called a plumber to look at the faucet, and I got to go home early because I was wet and uncomfortable.
What are some immediate deal-breakers for dating?	Just 1, and it's if they are homophobes. I pulled this trick twice in my life, but it was worth. Just as a casual question in a date, I ask them what they think about homosexual people. If they call em disgusting, I go with it and don't say anything. Then I wait patiently till I have her in my bed, have rough sex with her and when we are done I wait for the question "Did you like it?". My answer both times was "It was ok, but my exboyfriend was better at blowjobs" (which was true both times). Then you wait for that confused look into that realitzation that I like guys too. That moment is fucking great.	I think the crazy ex thing is pretty universal, I've heard it from plenty of girls too. I've heard plenty of them explain their previous relationships as something like: 'I was doing nothing wrong at all, and was completely right in every conversation we had, then one day he just changed and got really angry and left because he wasn't a real man'. There's nothing inherently wrong with having a crazy person in your past, the thing that turns me off is when people have no insight into it, and take no ownership over their past mistakes.
What makes a girl crazy or clingy?	Do not call or text me (unless it's legitimately important): - In the middle of the night - When you know I'm at work - More than thrice daily - When you know I'm otherwise occupied Also, "crazy" or "clingy" is definitely achieved when you insist on contacting me after a break-up or have unreasonable illusions about every woman I speak with.	Best advice I ever took (as a lady): If a guy doesn't seem interested, walk away. People who do not give you their time are not worth yours.
How true is, "If s/he likes you, s/he will make time for you," at different stages of dating/relationships?	It's true. There are legit claims to people that complain about their friend getting a new SO and then disappearing. That time has to come from somewhere. If you like someone enough you'll find ways to make it work. When SO and I started dating we lived an hour apart, he drove up every weekend, often during the week even, just to see me for a couple hours. Even if he was just sleeping in my dorm bc he was so tired. This was during his landscaping job where he'd have to wake up at 4 am just to make it back in time for work. It has not faded with time.	I would think this would be true at every point during the relationship. If you're really into someone you'll make time to be with them. Dating, SO, whatever. There can also be the other side of the extreme where someone expects the other person to always spend time with them.
Did any men have limited dating experience before 25? How did your relationships work out after?	Im 26, had one girlfriend from 19-23, then a few meaningless one night stands, never fell in love again, became extremely jealous, possessive, paranóid. Fuck bitches man	I didn't really date much until I was like 28. I'm 34 now and got engaged last week, so I'd say it worked out fine.
What’s the best compliment to give a man who has suffered a recent lack of confidence?	It's been 2 weeks and you are not going to find any magical way to make it all better. Start with simple things. Let all the air out of one tire on your car and then use a drill to drive a rusty old screw into the tire (between the treads). Call him to come over and change the tire because you don't know what to do. It will make him feel needed, which is a starting point.	Keep being kind to him. She must have said some deeply devastating things to him. It may take some time for him to get passed it and to remember that *he* dumped *her*, obviously for good reason. And, does it really matter what the complement is? People say they like my nail color, I'm smiling the rest of the day.
What is "bad timing"? Do you believe "bad timing" can cause a relationship to fail or fail to start?	With the exception of some truly rare events (terrible illness, close person dying, forced to move a plane ride away) it's just an excuse.	Bad timing is totally a thing. "I just got a job across the country" "My mother is in the hospital dying of cancer" "I'm married" "I just lost my job" "I just started dating someone else" "I've only been out of the institution for a week"
My friend told me I was asshole for ending the date with a woman because I didn’t met her requirements to have sexual relationship with her, How do I persuaded my friend that what I did was right for me ?	Yes, you were an asshole. But that's a good thing. Your choices were to be a doormat or an asshole. People like doormats. You can walk all over them, wipe dogshit off your shoes on them, it's great. That doesn't mean you want to be a doormat.	Dude if those are the requirements just to fuck her you dodged a huge bullet there... And your friend is an idiot.
Gentlemen. Your 15yr old daughter comes to you and says, "I want to get dates and have a boyfriend. How do I get boys to like me"? What do you tell her?	I'll be honest with her, all she has to do is look good and the boys will come to her.	I have a 14 year old that turns 15 in roughly a month. We've had this conversation, and I tell her that she is not to "get boys to like her", she is to be herself, which she does. The boys will either like her or not. I tell her not to change who she is for anyone, she's smart, funny, beautiful, strong, athletic (she's on the volleyball team and plays travel volleyball as well). If she changes and puts on a "show" for a boy, then he's not interested in who she REALLY is, and that person, the girl she REALLY is has value, is an important person, and not someone that has to change to please anyone. That's what I tell her. :-)
What would you consider a "green flag" in a relationship?	ITT: People not understanding the question. "Flags" are not features that have a value of their own, they're indicators of possible presence of features with negative or positive value. In this case, I'd say: Undivorced parents Having a reasonable number (2-4) of close female friends. Pursuit of "caregiving" careers (teacher, doctor, vet, nurse, pedagogue etc.) Limited social media presence Lack of tattoos Involvement in a charity, especially a kind that doesn't yield maximum bang for your buck in terms of bragging rights	Something frustrating/annoying/bad happens and she doesn't complain or go to pieces, and lets it go without letting it ruin the day.
Why do you think it is that I see so many guys say that they wish women would approach more and ask guys out YET so many women say that when they do so the men react poorly to it?	Can we get a tally here? Female, I've approached two men, wasn't rejected by either. Women have you approached men? Were you rejected? Men, have you been approached by women? Did you reject them? I'm just curious because I've never heard of what you are speaking of until today.	A man who has no problem being asked out isn't necessarily going to want to go on a date with any woman who asks him out. He has to actually be interested in her. I've heard women who decided that asking men out "didn't work" after getting rejected a handful of times. They need to separate "he didn't want to go on a date with me" from "he doesn't want to go on a date with any woman who asks him out". If a man got rejected once or twice and decided that "women don't like being asked out" then you could see the nonsense in that, right? With that said, there do exist men who have a problem being asked out by women. I don't think they're a majority, but they do exist.
As Men, do you resent that when something bad happens, you have to be the shoulder to cry on rather than crying yourself?	It's our job as men to stay strong in tough situations. It always has been throughout history. That's not to say you can't let it all out every now and then but only after that tough moment is over.	The only time I ever really objected to that was the time a girl broke up with me, then- on the spot, during the same conversation- wanted me to let her cry on my shoulder. About her breakup. With me.
Does it feel significantly different (better, more intense) when you finally get to fuck a woman you really love?	Meh, love isn't hot. Love leads to marriage and there's nothing less sexy than marriage. Write your men as insatiable narcissits who see a woman denying them as a lethal threat to their ego. Make them power-hungry sociopaths who can't fathom hearing "no". That will makes those juices and thus, bucks, flowing. Just ask the Shades of Grey lady.	The emotional connection makes it orders of magnitude better. It becomes less of a pure physical act (which has its place - sometimes just pure animalistic lust is just what I want) and more of a spiritual one if we are both just focused on each other.
Why doesn't the constant urge to have sex go away?	Unfortunately it doesn't and it can get worse. My wife got a breast reduction 3 years ago and I went into non-stop attracted to other women mode which has completely derailed me. Distracted doesn't even come close.	Old man reporting in. At 50+ my libido has finally started to taper off just enough so that sex isn't constantly on my mind. Thank fucking God...
What was something mean you did to your girlfriend/wife that made them cry?	Nothing. I don't do mean things to her that make her cry. I know that's "too uptight" a relationship by reddit's standards, but the advantage is that my conscience is clear as crystal. What few incidents of carelessness there have been, have been so minor that she doesn't even remember them - and they were nowhere near enough to move her to tears.	When she was pregnant I stomped her ass in monopoly. She cried Everytime she landed on one of my FOUR railroads. Edit: I forgot to mention the outcome. I just gave her all my railroads for free. She cried again because it was sweet. I still won, she cried again. Pregnancy is funny like that.
Men, are you really that oblivious when it comes to whether or not a girl is into you?	No. Honestly every time I read one of these threads on a similar topic around 'I have no idea when a girl is into me' I'm always left perplexed, and frankly a little dubious. Maybe it's a tactic other men use to act aloof or something, but to me (trying to not come over arrogant here) it's pretty obvious when a girl is into me. I'm not talking about clichéd physical 'tells' like playing with her hair or holding your gaze etc etc, but you just have a feeling when things are going well with a girl. She's responding attentively to you and to what you're saying, you're doing the same. It's on. Maybe it's an age thing. I'm 32 now and settled with a gf, but this really hasn't been an issue for over 10 years now.	It's two things: * Some guys really are that oblivious * Other guys see the possible hints, but one girl's "obvious hints" is another girl's "just being friendly". That, plus not wanting to be "creepy" = overly cautious At this point, I'd still be a bit skeptical if a girl said she liked me. It goes against years of negative reinforcement, and it would take more than a single, one-off contrarian opinion for me to change my mindset.
Is a bro's sister off limits?	Depends on the bro, but most would say "off limits". Edit: But ultimately, it's up to you and her if you guys want to be together. Most bros are just concerned that you're just trying to hit it and quit it. If you really care about her, and you show that to your bro, then he **should** be okay with you dating his sister. Edit: It'll still be a little awkward though.	No, BUT(!), you don't fuck with that chick and mislead her. I mean, you should already *not* mislead people, but especially your friend's sister.
How can I stop putting women in a pedestal?	Learn to masturbate. Rub one out before you interact with a woman - then you won't have your judgement clouded with the little head	Behavior: you know what the habit is. Stop doing it. I have a rule where I send a maximum of two messages. If they don't respond, I don't send any more. Psychological: my guess why you put women on a pedestal is because you don't feel you have much to offer. To that end, do whatever you can to make yourself interesting, and make yourself close to the person who you want to be. Pick up as many responsibilities as you can. Only good things will follow.
Dudes of Reddit, do you still have old reports from nursery/kindergarten and, if so, what did teachers have to say about you back then?	I was always considered the good kid. Sat quietly in class, did good in school. I'd say it only changed in high school when I became more confident and got more friends, did more jokes. High school was a good time.	I cleaned my basement a few weeks ago and found a report card from kindergarten. I scored a 13 out of 100 on my listening skills.
What Dad Joke was your Dad's go-to while you were growing up?	Son: Dad, where are my crayons? Dad: it would be in the same box where you last put it. This is my usual dialogue with my kids. After sometime, Son: Dad...please? Dad: ok.... in the blue box... Son: It's not there.... Dad: Did you check thoroughly? Son: ya...there it is. Dad: Focus on whatever you are doing... Son: But had you asked me to check thoroughly during the first time itself, I would have focused. .... The above is by my younger son's recent retort..	***EVERY*** single God damn time I started a sentence with, "Well,-" he'd quickly go, "that's a deep subject." EVERY TIME. Still my favorite joke to pull on people to this day.
OK fellas here we go. How would you take it if your son came out and told you he was bi or gay?	I’d be pretty pissed if he was my only son, let’s be real. But at the end of the day what can I do? Accept him and move on, probably try to have another son that will hopefully not be gay that can give me grandbabies. Before you say it, no - adoption doesn’t count. Sorry not sorry. Just being honest	He already knows it wouldn't change a thing; I get quite yelly about not treating lgbtq relationships as less-than. I would, however, *definitely* do the 'hello Gay, I'm dad' thing, because I am not made of fucking stone.
How do I keep telling the guy I’m dating that I’m not comfortable sending him nude pics?	What he's doing is DEFINITELY not acceptable. You shouldn't have to feel pressured to send nudes to keep a guy when you're uncomfortable with it. You don't have to feel guilty for not doing it and you don't owe him anything beyond "I'm uncomfortable with it". "So my question is, how big of a red flag is this? " That's for you to decide. I'd recommend communicating more sternly and clearly before you call it quits. If he still pushes, he's probably not the one. Oh and fuck him for saying he'll ask other girls. Honestly that's a bigger red flag for me than insisting. I'd tell him to go ahead and finish the thing right there.	I think I'm too old for this question, cuz to me if you're seeing some dude for 3 months and seeing him for a date or hookup weekly that's pretty much a boyfriend. If he's not respecting your boundaries it's better to learn it now than later. Especially when he's basically said if you won't someone else will. Tell him to text another girl and delete your number.
How do you handle it when another guy treats your SO like shit?	I would straight up fight them, want to fight them, or would threaten to fight them. Assuming she's not an overexaggerating drama-queen or that it wasn't some kind of misunderstanding at least.	It depends on the girl, some girls want you to stand up for them, but I've found most girls want to fight their own battles. The answer isn't to protect her, its to support her, but what that means changes from relationship to relationship.
Why are you single?	Broke, single, out of shape, depressed, not interested in anything, not good company, no friends, unemployed, no hobbies, ugly, fat, stupid, suicidal, worthless, fat, stupid, ugly, broke, jobless, stupid	Couple of reasons, one of the biggest ones is probably how clueless I am, I just how no idea how to handle even slightly romantic or sexual situations. also I'm rather shy, but don't look the part (I'm pretty confident in other areas) which also makes this more difficult. and finally I guess I'm just lazy, trying to work on that part but it's hard to change
What’s the longest it has taken you to get over someone?	Just a couple of days, really. The only frustrating part is that I still haven’t found a rebound girl yet. E: why is this getting downvoted?	Fair warning: Don't read these comments if you just got dumped and want some assurance that everything will be OK.
Does anyone else think getting married before 25 is just kind of... insane?	Fuck yes! I even go farther and say that having a serious relationship before 25 is generally a bad idea. In the years before, you're still learning who you are. If you're constantly trying to please and grow with some one, you aren't growing in an organic way. You just done know enough about yourself and the world before 25. I always have people say that it's harder to have kids around 30, which may be true. But that doesn't mean its not going to happen. You need to fill your own needs before you should concentrate on a child.	What was the point of putting all that emphasis on the couple being straight just so you could put "or gays" in parentheses?
How do you guys feel after breaking up with someone who you knew wasn't good for you?	I honestly enjoy breakups. The being with someone part is obviously very fun and enjoyable, but it kind of hypnotizes me and turns off my thinking. I'm not really myself when I'm with someone. The part where you break up is where you get to experience the emotional turmoil of intimacy with another person without the foggy glasses and sheepish content of reciprocated infatuation. It's the part where I feel alive.	Feels like being relieved of a huge burden, that they were weighing me down physically and mentally. That's the only way I can describe it.
Would any of you NOT want to receive nudes?	I think sending nudes is a pretty clear sign of poor judgment, which is something I generally don't look for in a partner. I guess I wouldn't really be *put off* by it, but it certainly would influence my opinion of the person.	I speak for myself when I say that under the assumption of being interested in the girl: I always welcome it.
How homoerotic is your humor when it’s just you and the boys?	I’m bisexual. My straight guy friends still sometimes do that immature pretending to be gay thing for some reason. It’s super strange.	I was out with 2 of my friends at a bar and we were just chillin and bullshittin, when one of my friends says, "Can I hold both of your hands while you suck each others dicks?" We laughed hysterically for at least 10 minutes. So, I'd say pretty queerosexual.
How do you handle your parents' mortality?	People die, deal with it. The end. I'll get downvoted but that's how I deal with it. My dad died 12 years ago from a random malady that struck quickly and surprisingly. I mourned for a short while, and still do sometimes when I think about him, but overall I got over it and carried on. Death is a part of life. You can't help it. No sense letting someone's else's death ruin your current life is the way I see it.	I went through this thought experiment not too long ago. What I kept finding was that even in the worst case scenario, the only thing that gave me mental peace was acknowledging that the best thing that I can do in life, is enjoy every moment I have left with all my loved ones. That way when they eventually leave this existence, you can always fall back on knowing that you did your best under those circumstances. Because that is the only thing we have control over in this reality, don't worry about the things that are out of your control, worry about what you CAN do from now on and enjoy every minute of it. That's how I found mental peace in my loved ones dying.
Guys, Why Do We Make Grunting Noises When We Pick Ourselves Up?	Because you're out of shape. The grunting noise you make when getting out of a chair is a minor version of the noise fit guys make when deadlifting. Start making that noise while deadlifting, and you'll stop making it when you stand up.	It's an expression of disappointment at the fact that we were comfortable in some way and now have to move. It's not aimed at anybody other than the universe.
Men of reddit, what would your girlfriend/fiancée/wife do if she found out you look at porn?	She's probably cheating on you if she goes through your shit. I'd leave her ASAP. No good person would ever order their significant other to stop doing something they like doing.	Holy fucking shit. Dude. Red flags. Unless you are wanking 24/7 and ignoring your relationship, porn is not an issue. It is entirely normally. And you have every right to be pissed at the invasion of privacy.
What was your first breakup like?	I cheated on my first girlfriend with a girl from my school who I had been crushing on for years, so I kinda had it coming. The main thing that hurt was the guy she left me for a month later, this tiny ratty looking motherfucker who was two years younger than me.	This was ten years ago. Started to date at the end of high school (she was my prom date). She went off to college but I was still at home since my school started two weeks later. We were talking on the phone and just the way she sounded - like she was dancing around the subject - was too obvious "Are you breaking up with me?" "...yes..." "Okay," Then we kept talking for an hour about college. We're still friends
What tips can you give to a woman who wants to make the first move?	*sigh* just fucking do it the same way you'd expect a guy to approach you. If anything we're much easier to approach than vice versa. Why do women always ask this question so damn much? A lot of guys have had to basically figure this shit out on our own (a lot of the time from watching other guys), why can't you, exactly? Not exactly rocket science	being approached by a woman is absolutely not a turn off. it's a major turn on. we almost never get approached. expect the guy to be a bit in shock/not know what to do because it's likely that this has never happened to him before, but he'll be super psyched about it if he's into you.
What is your opinion of having sex on the first date when looking for a relationship?	Honestly, if she sleeps with me on the first date I'm going to assume she's easy and sleeps with a lot of other men. I like when a girl is willing to holdback and let the tension build up a little. I think it makes the sex better once it finally does happen.	To me, it just means we're really into each other. What makes them girlfriend material is what we do afterwards. I've never got the whole "losing respect" thing. Sex is fun and natural. Unless they're huge degenerates, I couldn't see it as a bad thing.
My fellow fellas, how do you feel about the idea of adult play parks?	Well the first thing that came to my mind was an "adult play" park, that encouraged "adult play." If that's what you're talking about then I'm all for it. I'd love to be bent over on a jungle gym and let a hung stud have his way with me and fill me up.	Honestly... I think it's an AMAZING idea. I could see this really taking off: Like... a GIANT area with a massive network of monkey bars, slides, ramps, tunnels, ropes, beams, nets, stairs, towers, bridges, etc... I would be an awesome place to hangout, play with other adults, and encourage fitness. I'll meet you there after work!
Why is 30 described as the magical age for guys?	Men age like wine; women age like milk. As you get older, your perceived value to society increases. This is because a) men tend to become more attractive, as well as more manly, as they age and b) the experience and stability that comes with being in the labour market for that long is attractive to people. So work out and stay healthy.	I do believe that men generally have an easier time on the dating market when they're older while women generally have an easier time when they're younger. Women are more likely to prioritize confidence, charisma, and success in a partner, and these things grow over time. Men are more likely to prioritize youth and physical beauty in a partner, and these things start higher but fade over time. These aren't absolutes but they're trends. But "just wait until you're 30" is awful advice. First of all, it's not like men in their teens and early 20s (or women in their 30s) are undateable or can't possibly succeed. Plenty do. And second of all, your charisma, confidence, and success aren't going to increase on their own. You have to put effort into this stuff. Thinking that everything will magically change in your favour when you're 30 is naive.
What is your "I probably shouldn't be here" story?	Russ (the singer from my old band) and I are hanging out with some friends, and some ladies, and the ladies say they'd like to go to this one club. I'd been there before, was a gay club. I'm a straight guy, but I love gay clubs. Real talk, if you're cool with your sexuality, gay clubs are fucking fun as hell. Girls eat that shit up by the way, if you're cool enough with yourself to go with them to a gay club and actually have a good time, they'll dig you forever. Anyway, so we get to the club, right? Well, the club isn't a gay club anymore. The club is....well....it's decidedly darker than it used to be.... It was a club for hoods and hoodrats. We were white hardcore/punk dudes. Peaced it without even telling the girls, but they definitely didn't give a shit anyway.	Was 17. Went to go buy weed and my friend and I went to this dudes house. Come to find out my friend owed this guy a lot of money because my friend had a bit of a coke habit. Said dude pulled out a pistol and began beating my friend with it and pointed at him. Quickly said ima be in the car ran out and started the car and waited a minute. Friend came out totally bloody and with no weed. My friend died of a drug overdose within the next year. Hard drugs are dumb and can often put you in bad situations but prohibition which causes a lot of this violence & greed is dumber.
What's the preferred way to end a relationship with someone who you've gone on two dates with?	The problem with just sending a text is the technology isn't 100% reliable. And I agree a call puts her on the spot and will be unnecessarily awkward. The best compromise I can think of is a certified letter. That way it's not awkward for either of you and you get a signed receipt confirming she received your written message.	Woman here. Text or call ESPECIALLY if she thinks sex is in the table. It would suck to shave and pluck and put on the matching undies just to get dumped.
What has an ex ruined for you?	I'm going to get downvoted but fuck it. Not to derail, but I don't think that askmen should do this. The top posts in askwomen are frequently about how abused you were, how guys fucked you over and how much men suck. Askmen should aspire to be better than that. Women don't suck. Women haven't ruined us. All exes, regardless of gender, deserve each other.	My ex ruined relationships for me. Its been 3 years, i have a romantic person tucked somewhere deep... but i cant seem to open up to a new person emotionally. Ive been called jaded, but the effort just seems like too much to try again, and even if i did... i cant seem to get that comfortable "i want to spend time with you" like i used to
From a guy's perspective, what would your thoughts be if you found out your friends GF had a crush on you?	1. I'd lose quite a bit respect for her, and see her as a friendship-wrecking, manipulative beach, 2. I'd let my friend know what's going on, 3. *"In my opinion, I think crushes like that are almost inevitable."* No dear, they **ARE NOT**. For you, hanging around a friend of your guy means you need to be crush-y/flirty with him? WTF, man?! >What would your thoughts/reaction/opinion be if you found out a friend's girlfriend had a crush on you? I'd realize she was the type of person to sleep with her SO's best-friend if the r'ship ever goes south. And I hate beaches like that. **PS: Although my comment might have come off as sexist, but I'm an equal-opportunity hater in this regard. I deeply hate/resent the lazy/classless assholes/scumbags who 'crush over' their friends' gf's as well...**	Flattered, but I would redouble my efforts to be really cautious about being alone with them or anything like that. I know that I wouldn't do anything like that, but sometimes people like to draw conclusions, so I would avoid putting myself into a position where I could even possibly be seen as getting involved beyond just being a friend.
Since joining reddit, how has it changed you, for better or for worse?	I got some perspective, but also exposure to some rather nasty people. take the good with the bad, i guess	It's given me access to many different perspectives that I'd probably never get to hear otherwise. On the other hand, it's made me hate people more because of it.
Is it shallow to lose attraction to a girl after finding out what she looks like without makeup?	No. Women cake so much makeup on their face and look like a completely different person and then get mad when you're not attracted to their natural face, a face you've never seen before.	Yes, but all of these things from other comments: > you like what you like. You shouldn't be harassed over that. > You're attracted to what you're attracted to. Plus, the differences can be big enough that even if they're attractive without makeup, it could look odd compared to what you're used to and still turn you off which is completely understandable. > You can't control who you're attracted to, and many women use makeup to hide the fact that they are not attractive > Can't help what you like. > You're allowed to decide for yourself (or more accurately, let your instincts decide for you) what you do and do not find attractive.You don't have to justify it to anyone. are still true.
Men, once you have sex with a girl, what makes you want to stop talking to them?	I wouldnt say this is the case with a majority of men. try phrasing your question in a way that doesnt imply all men are assholes like you	When the sex high goes away and everything is back to normal and human flaws start to shine through again.
Single men, do you ever go through a phase where you become a robot, do what you need to do to survive and no interest in anything else?	Holly duck. Wait till you get married, you become the fat version of the T2000. The best time in your life is now. Old enough to be independent and earning $. No commitment or responsibility to tie you down. Freedom	Yeah currently living like this, feels like I’m on autopilot and all I think about is work since it’s the only thing going on in my life.
Men who changed their diet from complete garbage food to very healthy food, how did you deal with being such an intolerable cunt for the first week or so?	Part of being a man is knowing how to control the feeling of being a cunt. It doesn't matter if you've invited a new variable into your life, it's not anyone else's fault. I've been through the crap food detox phase while I watched my friends pig out on delicious food, but it was my choice to do that so I don't hold it against them for eating what they want to. You'll have head aches and you have strong cravings for carbs and everything, but keep your eye on your goal. Know that when everyone says the crap week ends and you start feeling better is telling the truth. You just have to push through it and want it enough, it becomes easier over time but you have to find that out on your own.	You get over it in about a week. Drink plenty of water, especially after a meal, sleep right and just wait it out. It's tough. It can last for a couple if days to a week or so. You'll be fine.
How would you react if a stranger insulted you and your girlfriend in public?	Tell him his boyfriend wouldn't like him talking like that to strangers. Dollars to donuts if there's an assault charge it'll be his. My guess is he mistook your friend for someone else.	I've learnt one thing in AskMen: everything with the word "emasculated" in it is bullshit. If I had that happen to me I'd be amused that somebody is insulting us and proceed to troll him for more.
What do you think that women nowadays are too critical of men for? Why?	Because we don't treat women like we used too. They've always been critical and always will, it's us that perceives.	Feelings and maturity. I've had girls tell me they've dumped guys because they started to get too "emotional" and would cry about some pretty deep shit. That's not cool. I hate that perception that dudes can't cry and shit. Maturity as in that apparently now that I'm 23 years old it means I shouldn't be playing video games, love LOTR, or watching anime, but doing stuff like "adventuring, hiking, etc." I may be grown now with a job, etc., but in my eyes it's like I have the money to afford the things I never could as a kid. It's my chance to have the fun I wanted. I still go out, work out at the gym, and so-on so fuck anyone who judges how I spend my extra free time.
Why is the slang "cunt" considered as unutterable as it is, in the U.S.A.?	FWIW, I'm a white, cis, hetero, American male. My limited understanding is that "cunt" is offensive largely because it's mainly used to describe women in our society. And to reduce women to their 'cunts' — i.e. their mechanism for sex and reproduction — taps into the sources of misogyny that have oppressed women since ever. Calling a woman a 'walking vagina' is just horribly dehumanizing. Sure, Aussies call men 'cunts', but I get the feeling that when Americans call men 'cunts', it's a deliberately foreign idea — like calling a toilet a 'loo'. You just wouldn't call a man a cunt, like you wouldn't call a woman a 'dick'. But that's just my experience.	How insensitive does someone have to be to call someone else a genital name? I mean what a bunch of dicks
My GF is aborting our baby and it’s mentally destroying me. What do I do?	I get the "her body, her choice" stuff. I do. The way I see it, though, there are two bodies, there, and one is 50% the dad's, and it's clear the Dad loves it. I'm sorry, man. I have no idea what to do in this situation. All I can offer is that I think it's natural to feel that way about this; I don't think what you're feeling is wrong, and I am genuinely sorry. It's almost as if having your choice taken away sucks for *all* parties involved.	Get someone to talk to. A professional is probably better. Talking it out with friends and family will probably poison their relationship to her or you since this will be something you feel strongly about and abortion is a topic that kills from miles away. Keep that in mind. I'd think long and hard about if you want to continue a relationship with someone that has different goals as far as children are concerned.
Have you ever seen any of your female friends naked / semi naked? What's the story and there was any awkwardness?	I had sex with several of my female friends from college. Just drunken one night stands. It was surprisingly not at all awkward with the women. It was my guy friends who always had the problem (they had a crush or whatever and got mad at me because I knew about it).	I have seen my best friend naked. I even bathed her. She has no family so when she had a few medical issues I kind of stepped up for her. It was not really as awkward as I thought it would be cause she is a fairly hard core lesbian so I think my brain just sort of did not recognise her as a possible sexual being?? I don't know, to me she is just one of my boys??
Divorced mom making my father's life difficult every way she can now that he has a girlfriend. What can I do to help calm her down?	Stay out of it - it's between your mum and your dad. They've already got a divorce and it's their business. If it makes you feel uncomfortable that she talks about it, either tell her, ignore it or leave, but don't involve yourself directly or defend one to the other - really good way to piss everyone off and end up in a world of shit.	Honestly I would talk with your mom about seeing a therapist if she isn't yet. Sounds like she has a lot of personal problems and is taking them out on everyone else instead of dealing with them.
What's your worst experience after becoming emotionally invested in someone you thought felt the same way for you?	ITT: The pussyfication of men in the 21st century. Not a jab at the men here, but these stories (as I have plenty of my own) are a real bad consequence of what we have been spoonfed by Disney, feminism and cultural marxists. If you can't see it, then you are fooling yourself. Men are weak because we lack strong examples, masculinity has been demonized and termed " toxic ". These stories are all natural consequences of men trying to tame their masculinity and turning into little girls in the process. We are turning into penis having little girls and it's fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine.	I told a girlfriend what I'd been through and opened up to her after a month of her pestering me to "open up." This was c. 2016 when it was 'trendy' to have guys suddenly spill open all their feelings of sunshine and rainbows. I finally let her know I'd been struggling with anxiety at my new job and how worried I was about the huge gamble we'd taken moving so far from where we'd graduated. "I think less of you for that" were the first words out of her mouth. I dumped her on the spot, and that has been difficult to get over.
Seeing your first pair of breasts in real life, how good was it?	I was like 12 and this girl was flashing another dude. Her tittys were very tubular and pointed in opposite directions. I've seen many many tits in my life and those are still the worst pair I have ever seen.	If I'm gonna be truly honest. Seeing them is nice. But the coolest thing I did was touch one. I like to look at a nice pair. But mostly I just wanna lay my head on her chest and just breathe. If its all good, I might just relax and take a quick 20 min nap.
What’s one reason you personally might go soft during sex/not have interest in the moment?	Condoms. Go soft every time I put them on. Edit: you guys are weird. Why are you downvoting my comment. It’s just my experience.	Leg cramp. It's hard to to stay hard when you are freaking out trying to get off the bed all while trying to stretch it out. It's happened before and I guarantee that it'll happen again.
My wife doesn't understand why men constantly grab their junk. Let's hear some reasons to make her understand?	We do? Well, I don't. None of my friends do. In fact, I don't know a single guy nor have I ever known one to constantly grab their junk.	Tell her that we get “boob sweat” under our balls and we need to move things a bit to air them out.
What's your experience with dating religious girls vs non-religious girls?	What are these religious people of which you speak and where do I find them? I hear they believe there's a dude with a beard in the clouds watching them masturbate or something.	You are basically asking a bunch of liberal atheists what they think of dating religious girls. The general consensus will always be: "their Jesus stuff drove me crazy but she was a freak in the sheets lawl."
In terms of a relationship, how do you deal with the transition period between just meeting/starting out and actually becoming a couple?	"... communicating non stop." Curtail that. "... dinner with my friends..." Too soon. I'd typically do solo dates for a couple months. If you see each other once a week that's 8 dates. The relationship determining conversation happens naturally at that point. Over-eagerness is perceived as neediness.	Go on your date tonight. If you guys have fun, just say "Hey, I had a great time tonight. Can we do this again soon?" Rinse, repeat, etc. If she makes other plans, no big deal. People are busy. Just do the best you can do.
Any other guys totally repulsed by the traditional idea of a bachelor's party?	No, I am not totally repulsed by the "traditional idea of a bachelor’s party". Where I am from, strippers and that sort of thing aren’t all that common anyway. But I don’t see anything wrong with it. For men who actually have real life sexual appeal to women, the sexual exclusivity part of a LTR and/or marriage *is* a "necessary evil". Most men are happy to make the trade-off when they have found a great woman. But most men who are actually able to obtain sex without months of courting, will to some degree feel the sting of no more variety. And that is what the "ritual" of strippers, lapdances, etc. etc. symbolizes that the groom is saying goodbye to.	FWIW I've been to around a half dozen bachelor's parties. None involved a dancer grinding up on the man of the hour, and only one involved a strip club.
What makes a girl boring to you?	Girls that seem like they have something to prove in terms of masculinity. I play soccer and attend a lot of women's co-rec soccer games because my SO also plays soccer and when we have dinner and stuff with other soccer people the girls are always trying to pit themselves against the guys. It's weird.	Having no personality, no hobbies, no aspirations. Also, being completely passive and unable to pull her weight in a conversation is a big one. >Is there an acceptable amount of boring that you could overlook if there is some chemistry between you? If she's boring at all then there won't be any chemistry.
Men, how old were you when you finally figured out what you wanted to do in life?	18 . It didn't require a lot of thought either. It just came out of nowhere and I have loved it ever since.	I'm 50 and I'll just sit here in the corner and see if I get any ideas from this thread.
Which celebrity have you been told you look like?	This happens so often for me I started keeping a list a few years back. Every listing here was volunteered by people at randomly as I go about my life. No one was asked and it wasn't pertinent to the conversation, but apparently the resemblance was so strong they had to tell me. This is the list copy and pasted. People I've been told I look like Burt Reynolds Jason Biggs. Died rich bayder, Ron Livingston, the lead singer from Metallica w/ shorter hair Danny masterson. John travolta in... From Paris with love Chris prat Seth rogen. Paul Rudd, liev schreiber, Robert di Nero, mark and Donnie whallberg, Leonardo di caprio, Vince Vaughn, Joshua Jackson, Christopher mints-place John Hannah John favreau Ray liota Tom hanks Danny mcbride Young Richard Dreyfus Hugh Jackman Dane cook Owen Wilson Young Orson wells Peter sarsgard Stuart gill Paul giamatti Ben affleck	Robert Downey Jr. I was told I looked like him a lot. This was in the 90s. One time we were watching E! and a story about him getting arrested came on and my 2 years old son started pointing at the tv saying daddy. But that was the 90s, today not so much.
What's the best thing a girl can do to make you feel strong and sexy?	Unless you can maintain the facade for life you should probably just be yourself rather than play act perfection as you will eventually be discovered.	My wife just hit one on the head last night, that I didn't even know mattered to me. She was sitting next to me on the couch with her head on my shoulder, holding my hand, and she said - in this breath-y, exhaling kind of way - "I can't believe how hard you work for us. No one has ever tried so hard to make me happy." I'm not a cryer, but man, my heart was in my throat when I heard that. Because you know what? I **do** work my ass off to make things good for our marriage, our family, and for her specifically. It was like I got the wind knocked out of me, it made me so happy and so relieved.
Men of Reddit, how often do you encounter a "starfish" in bed?	kinky? Lol...One thing ive learned is women LOVE to talk themselfs up..LOVE it..they love to say "oh i give the best blowjobs" or something Reality is..100% of the lays ive personally been with were star fish..hell i don't even think ive ever had a proper blowjob without the girl nearly biting my dick off. Foreplay? Lol...Yeah right.. its usually sex for 15 minutes or they complain > then they get off > goes to bed > blueballed and yet women love to cry "oh all guys do is care about themselfs!" Lol...Alrighty then	> It seems like 90% of women I've ever discussed sex with Women who starfish are unlikely to discuss sex a lot, while the reverse is most likely true for fairly kinky individuals. That might explain what you're experiencing (I'm sure there's a name for that... selection bias maybe?). I've luckily never had a real starfish (as in someone who really didn't do anything), but I've had very few partners who would put in as much physical effort and initiative as I did. The few that did really stand out head and shoulders above the rest in terms of how good the sex was.
How do I stop casually dating a girl that I'm not that interested in, without being a dick and just not responding?	Text her: "Hey, I'm just not feeling the spark between us. You seem like a cool person, but it's just not there for me. I didn't want to pull the fade away, so here I am, taking responsibility for my feelings. Good luck finding someone else."	Don't pull the fade - it's really a dick thing to do. Be clear with her that you don't see this going further and don't waste any more time. It's never an easy conversation to have, but the person on the receiving end should appreciate the directness in the long run.
My girlfriend died. How did you deal with this?	Take a year to mourn your dead, then see if you can move forward. Life is hard enough going it alone.	Jesus, mate. I haven't had anything like that happen to me but like with any tragedy it's going to take a long time for it to stop hurting. You're never going to forget her but you have to move on. Maybe not today, tomorrow, this year. But you have your own life to live. I know that if I died I'd want my girlfriend to live her life to the fullest and I'm sure your girlfriend would want that for you.
What's your opinion on mandatory military service?	I support mandatory national service, it worked for the U.S. before WW2. Mandatory military service though... that can be problematic.	I'm a former (US) Army Captain and 2x Company Commander. While I can definitely see some benefit to mandatory military service, I'd take 60 Soldiers who wanted to be in the Army over 120 Soldiers who are only there because they have to be any day of the week.
How old are you, and what’s the oldest you would date?	Mid thirties. Same age as me, I'd like to have kids at some point and a woman older than me is pretty much out of gas.	I'm 27. Last time I was on the online dating scene, I believe my profile was set to match with people up to 10 years older. Realistically, I would go higher, provided we were compatible, could keep up with each other and I found her attractive. I'm not sure I could get in a romantic, commited relationship with someone so much older than me, though - I can see a lot of inconveniences. Hookups and friendships? Sure.
What's the most "unmanly" thing you do?	I'm really surprised no one has said "Your Mom" since technically, she isn't manly... unless she's a butch dike or a post op...	I'm a man. If I do it, it's by definition "manly." And that includes having tea parties with a toddler and helping her put a bonnet on her beloved Pooh Bear.
Guys, would you mind if a girl approached you in public and complimented your appearance?	Seeing as you think hes attractive...he prob is in general...so he wont be intimidated, and if it were me I would be attempting to plant a seed to Fuck you since your attraction is obvious	Mind? It would make my fucking day. A girl complimented my shirt once and it left me on high for the rest of the day. Yes, definitely, go for it. Approach him in private, tell him you find him attractive and introduce yourself. It will go well, guaranteed.
Why are so many people in the dating scene in competition with each other over who cares the least?	We live in a culture that is easily offended by anything and everything. All in a sad attempt to prevent hurting feelings. This bleeds over into the dating scene as well, but in an interesting way. The one who cares the most in the relationship tends to be hurt the most. So to combat that, people adopt an attitude of not caring. Not saying that it's not needed to some degree but to an extreme is a set up for failure.	I think its from the throwaway culture that has moved into dating now. Why bother to put in any effort to a Tinder or Bumble match conversation when you can just swipe 50 more times and get new ones? It's the feeling that there's always something better hiding around the corner so any perceived minor flaw becomes a deal breaker. The problem is 2-5 messages don't usually actually show any flaws, it's just people's unrealistic expectations to begin with.
I'm in a car with 4 girls singing 2000s Shakira at the tops of their lungs- when was the last time you wanted to barrel roll out of a moving vehicle?	I don't smoke but my friends do. It's nbd most times and I was with them while they were blunt cruising. These fuckers smoked high grade hash and then high grade weed. Then they played deadmau5 with the system BOOMING. I fucking melted in the back seat and felt the bass ripple through me with every hit. Mars was wonderful	I had a trio of friends that were drunk and pissed off a cabby in DC by being drunk idiots. One of them, being a drunk idiot, had the brilliant idea of barrel rolling out of a moving car. He ended up in the ICU for awhile and now has a plate on his skull. Just, you know, helping you determine cost/benefit.
How do people react when you tell them about your career?	“Soo... what’s your interest in that...???” I run a camp for LGBTQ+ kids and parents. I’m queer, but I pass most of the time. Every time I mention what I do, within a breath, someone is trying to make sure I was just outing myself. Which is fine, I guess.	My job is not that interesting, so one or two boring questions like “what does that involve exactly” “do you like it” and that’s the end of it
Do you happen to fulfill a stereotype or trope in anyway? If you do, what is it?	I'm a hot gamer girl (and before anybody asks yes I'm a real gamer, the only console I dont own is xbox and I have 2 gaming computers) I'm also a lazy stoner And I'm a girl that's borderline obsessed with my nails and hair	I'm a black guy who's dad left. I wear glasses and I'm a nerd. I'm a virgin and I use reddit. I'm fat and I like gaming.
What do your female friends offer that your male friends typically don't?	Hopefully a relationship at some point. EDIT: heading off the downvotes. I haven't really gained anything from female acquaintances that I didn't already have from male associates. This is the one thing special I could see coming of it.	Advice and insight about other women. My guy friends are great and I treat them like family but relationship advice isn't in their wheelhouse.
How do you fit and betray your stereotype?	Standard geek Fit: * Overweight * nearsighted * sloppily dressed and shaved * mostly talk about my field (information technology, specially as it pertains to the web) * live with my parents (though I can afford living somewhere else and have done so already, but since currently I'm working in my hometown, there's no point spending the extra money). Betray: * I'm pretty liberal and egalitarian * don't like that many "geeky" things (not interested in conventions, board games, video games, games of any kind, only three tv shows, only one of which really intended at geeks; and I only watch genre movies because I watch *all* movies) * am interested in music and will probably/definitely take singing and dancing lessons this year EDIT: Format.	Stereotype: big native american Fit: Quiet Meek until provoked Physically strong but slow and deliberate Outdoorsy Kind of a drunk Betray: Well-read Technologically inclined Social chameleon Non-spiritual Can't stand having long hair
Married men. How did you know it was time to propose?	How did I know it was time? When she told me. Everyone should have a starter-marriage in their 20s. It teaches them what to do right the next time.	This is one of those life questions where the answer goes like this: "If you have to ask, you're not ready."
What did you think of your partner when you first met them?	I thought wow he is so adorable and shy and oh my god what if he hates me in person I'll have to delete my reddit account and never come back to /r/askmen	During a very boring lecture: Huh, this girl is really hot and isn't afraid to show some cleavage. And she doesn't seem to speak my language so that's perfect. Better start to "randomly" sit next to her and chat her up. Approaching 8 years now.
This was asked in AskWomen, but I'm curious as to how men would respond: Do you think Reddit is sexist/misogynistic/a hostile environment toward females?	I think a lot of people don't understand satire. Acting sexist is only funny because of how ridiculously unacceptable it is. When acting sexist in jest you are mocking those who do it in earnest. Many people have a hard time making that distinction which is what leads to confusion IMO.	the default subs certainly are, they're a closer reflection of society and there is a lot of misogyny (and misandry, and racism and all kinds of other bullshit) in society smaller ones like /r/askwomen and this one are much better, although there will always be misogyny that pops up from time to time
I'm putting my dog down today; any advice on how to deal with it?	> we're putting my dog down around 12 and his age is just catching up to him. Wait what? Please tell me I'm misreading this, it sounds like you're having him put down because he's old.	Be in the room when the vet puts him to sleep. I've read so many comments about people never forgiving themselves for not being in the room. I'm sorry you are going through this.
What is something girls do that they don’t realize hurts your feelings?	When they say hey I don't like you like you like me let's be friends. Bitch nahhhh that sounds like the worst friendship ever I'd rather be friends with Hitler	When our daughter was still an infant, my wife would sometimes take the baby away from me to comfort her when she was crying. It made me feel like a shitty father. Why wasn't I good enough to comfort our child? It's was an instinctual reaction of course. My wife meant nothing by it. But I had to make her realize what she was doing and how it made me feel.
Men, do your female friends become really 'jealous' when you show interest in a woman?	Female perspective here: something like that happening could be one of two situations. 1....they either care about you now or cared about you in the past, ROMANTICALLY, and are comparing themselves to her. They probably don't realize they're doing this. But they are. So they're definitely going to be vocal about all that crap. It's a pacifier. 2....they don't care about you romantically, but they truly do care about you a LOT...and they're the judgmental type to begin with.	Sometimes, which doesn't make sense to me, because my female friends either have a boyfriend, or we've had romantic feelings and I expressed mine, and they said they only see me as a friend. I mean if you only see me as a friend, then why are you getting butthurt when I mention a girl I'm talking to atm?
Psychologists theorize that women, not men, are largely the ones who suppress each others’ sexualities. Do you agree with this statement?	Yeah, I don't think so. It's men who keep rejecting women for being "whores" and value how many partners they have. Sure, some women love to judge and police other women but slut shaming is undeniably a male invention that was created to scare or shame women into maintaining their "sexual purity", whatever that means. Just because *some* men don't slut shame doesn't mean that all men don't and that women are magically responsible for this behavior. Also, I think it's important to recognize that slut shaming takes on many forms, some more nuanced than others. Asserting that you "would never let your wife/daughter/girlfriend" dress like any provocatively dressed person, judging someone's choice of birth control, etc are all forms of slut shaming that many men take part in but don't realize because it's not outright calling anyone a slut.	Considering that literally the only people I've ever met who ever tried to suppress or shame sexuality were women, this seems to be true in my experience.
Men who live with your SO's: What things do you wish in hindsight you'd talked about with your SO before moving in together?	I've been living with me SO for coming up on 3 decades now. We don't talk much but she's definitely my right hand woman. You could say we are attached for life barring any unforeseen accidents.	My wife and I have entirely different definitions of personal space and personal time. When we moved in together, it was a disaster. I walk in through the door after work and I'm slammed with 21 questions about my day and her day and everything else in between, which is something I was not used to. When I get home I like to unwind and relax for a few minutes before anything else. My wife likes to unwind by unloading her day on me. I've also just realized that I'm introverted, and she is not, so when I crave quiet and space, she craves conversation and closeness. It has taken nearly a year for us to adapt to each other and even know we still have hiccups, but we'll get through it.
Men of reddit, did you ever date a girl without being very interested in her, but she was quite into you? Why? Did things work out?	As one of my best friends said, “Anything is better than nothing”. And you just might find yourself more interested than you expected. He also said, “New is better than good”	Yeah, she was a nice girl but I really wasn’t into her, she was getting really attached and I didn’t feel the same way about her so I just broke things off. I still feel like an absolute asshole for breaking her heart even though she did some crazy stuff.
Men, what are things women think you find annoying but actually don't bother you at all?	This *should not* be a gender-specific thing, but only women have ever mentioned it for some reason... I'm not bothered at all by people walking slower than I do so I have to slow down. It's true I tend to walk quickly, but it's just a habit. There are at least four women who have repeatedly apologised for walking slowly when we are walking together, despite my telling them each time that I do not care about this. It's the weirdest thing.	Not being perfectly groomed. I honestly prefer my so looking like a hot mess in a hoodie...it's cute as all get out
What instrument(s) do you play or want to learn to play? Are you any good?	Cello, bass guitar, and some piano. I'm trying to get my friend to teach me electric guitar. Also I can play a wicked kazoo.	I play the saxophone (hello ladies) and the clarinet (hello classy ladies) as my two main instruments, I play the saxophone in a wind band and the clarinet in a jazz band. I also play the piano, the accordion and some guitar. I want to learn the guitar better, but I'd need a new guitar and that's expensive.
BF pees the bed. How not normal is this ?	One of my good buddies still wets the bed. He's turning 26 right away. Especially when he's drunk. His fiance is fucking gorgeous. So was his last girlfriend. I've heard them both complain about it, but they love him and basically just deal with it. He doesn't even hide it. Everyone knows it happens to him.	Something's off with him, either physiological or psychological. Has he seen any docs about this issue? It is definitely not normal.
How normal is it for you to fantasize about the women in your lives?	Women need a reason to have sex, men just need a place - Billy Crystal. &#x200B; I don't know if men or women picture others people in their lives, but I've heard it from both, mostly men. Sex is totally different for men than women. For men it's about as emotional as a morning pee. It's a mechanical function that one can include as part of the love and intimacy dance, but it is not necassary. &#x200B; As Nora Vincent said after her time posing as a man, "For women sex is here (pointing to her head), for men its here (pointing to her crotch). &#x200B; I'm happy with being male is all I can say.	Definitely. I find myself doing it less and less as I get older, but in high school and college age, it was pretty frequent.
My gym has a female janitor in the men's locker room all the time now. How do you feel about something like this? And about the double standard?	Personally, this would bother me. To have somebody who identifies as the opposite sex in the *locker room* (not solely the bathroom, there is a key distinction here) makes me remarkably uncomfortable. I actually encountered essentially the same situation, (I am a woman, though), we had a male custodian in our gym’s locker room. I talked to a manager about it, and they moved him to the men’s locker room only. If it were only a bathroom, where you go in a stall or the urinals have dividers, I think I could push it out of my mind. But the atmosphere of a locker room is disrupted with the presence of a different sex.	Former single dad. I used to use the baby changing table in the ladies room all the time because the men’s rooms rarely had them. No one ever cared. Sometimes ladies would hold the door for me, and once on a really bad day, a nice other mom even offered to change him for me because I looked so distressed. Being a single dad with an infant was damn tough.
23 year old guy and I look like I'm 16. Girls my age have never liked me, and when 18/19 year olds find out my age they back away after initially being interested. What can I do?	Female here. I met my future husband when I was 16 and we started dating when I turned 19. He is 4.5 years older than me. Additionally, my best friend met her fiancé when she was 22 and he was 34. They are very happy together. The girls who care about your age difference aren't mature enough to date you. Don't fret. There are many women who would be happy to date regardless of age difference.	I'm just like you buddy, except I'm Asian. So I look even younger than my already young self. I'm 26 and today I've found out a 21 year old looks older than me. Tbh dressing and mannerisms change the age you project mostly. Don't mind the ribbing it'll come and go. Just be more self confident and grow yourself as a person. A couple of years back I had the same problem as you. Objectively I still look like I'm 20 but after 2 minutes with me, no one asks how old I am anymore. Fun story: when I was working as a hospital cleaner, all the clothes they had were too big so I looked really child like in my uniform. The nurses would ask me if I've signed in for school that day. They were shocked to learn I was doing my master's on the side.
Dudes, when you are kissing a girl, do you go for top or bottom lip?	Top. It's already hard enough trying to kiss girls at 6'5, I'm not about to make myself have to crouch down even further. Top just makes sense, you know?	I aim for a Gaussian distribution in the X and Y planes and chart her reaction. After about 32 kisses I begin to have enough data to construct a chart which allows me to establish her preferences and focus on those. I'll send you my spreadsheet if you need a little help getting going.
TIL that when men pee sitting down, their penis sometimes touches the toilet bowl. What other crap do you guys put up with that most women wouldn't know about?	>"and sometimes even goes in the water" Ahhahahahahahahaha. Oh dear lord. Ok, so the distance that would take for a flaccid penis to drop into the water, at least around where I live, when sitting on the seat, would be about 10 inches from groin to water. That guys erection would be like 3 cans of coke taped together. Silly. Touching the porcelain happens. Being able to tell the depth of a swimming pool with your eyes closed does not.	When you get a boner, it's easy for it to get caught in a funny position in your pants. The results are quite uncomfortable, and moving wrong can quickly result in tent pole that everyone can see. As such, every man above about 13 learns the masterful art of subtly fixing his penis position with a quick motion while getting up or shifting position. It's truly an art form.
Does Rogaine really work?	No. Science is still several years from curing baldness. Own it and shave your head, and save hundreds of dollars in the process.	If anyone considering Rogaine has cats (since this is reddit), they should be aware that minoxidil is extremely toxic to felines even externally without ingestion. So keep it away from your cats and rinse your shower out carefully.
What's it like Going to a Bar Alone to Socialize?	I'm considered to be a decent woman. And I would not go to a bar. Especially with pandemic I don't even go to restaurants. I am using app like MeetMe to socialize.	What you want to do is go to bars in the afternoon, while it's still quiet. If you're lucky you will get to know a savvy bartender. If you become a regular then that bartender could turn out to be your first friend in town. They can tell you about the town, introduce you to other patrons and you will always be welcomed there. Pick cheap drinks but tip above average. Bartenders would rather you give them the money than put it in the register.
What movies make you cry?	Someone is going to say Up, and I just want to say that I really don't get the big deal about the intro. I don't really feel that connected to them as it's so early in the film, it almost feels sad for sad's sake which doesn't really do it for me. I remember welling up a little at the end of Blood Diamond. Great movie. I usually find myself more teary when something is excessively happy than sad, which I guess kinda strange.	Interstellar, when the video messages are being read. That scene always gets me. Also, the ending of blood diamond, "I'm exactly where it's supposed to be"... Damn. As always, Marley and me. Can't even blink. Finally, Lord of the Rings. I'm big on movie music and those epic scenes with the rohirrim in the two Towers and the return of the king have brought tears to my eyes. There was also a part in the extended edition where eowyn is found by eomer on the battlefield and he conveys some really powerful emotion.
Is the latest crop of young female stars particularly baby-faced or am I just getting old?	I've thought the same thing about those two. I'm a dude and I just can't see Ariana Grande as a sex object.	I think it's a common theme with petite girls, I can never tell how fucking old they are most of the time. She could be 16 or 27 only the god of many faces knows.
Why is depression so prevalent in modern age?	Because life is too damn easy for SO many people these days. There's less struggle (for many), which has led to a bunch of ungrateful, entitled fucking brats who are unfulfilled in life, and ultimately end up depressed. Fucking whaa...you don't get a trophy, because you SUCK!	Read “tribe” by sebastian junger, it’s only about 100 pages but is the best explanation I’ve found for it. The larger and more spread out we get, the less “relevant” we feel in the world. Everyone in a tribe has a place and a purpose. Without imminent threats to our survival and such an easy padded life, we have nothing to overcome or accomplish. He did an interview on joe rogan’s podcast too if you want a condensed version of it. He’s a pretty bright guy.
Men on medication for depression or Anxiety, what prompted you to seek out medication? What was life like before and what’s it like now?	Toxic masculinity says it is acceptable for her to do that, yes. My hope, though, is that I can help get her to a place where she is stable and healthy. Then she may be able to listen to me and handle more	Ativan is a wonder drug for shutting down anxiety when it’s overwhelming. It can stop you from pacing around a room crying for hours, let you sleep.
Men, what books are you reading at the moment and what are some quintessential books that every man should read?	Am re reading ' no more Mr nice guy ' but it's interesting how it really conflicts with '48 laws of power' . Looks to me like I am better off with Glover's book	I'm reading Brothers Karamazov, after reading a Vonnegut quote that read, "There is one other book, that can teach you everything you need to know about life... it's The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, but that's not enough anymore.” Its pretty good, made me think about religion and man's purpose in a way that I had never taken the time to do before. Other books that had a huge impact on me were: Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, The Great Gatsby by Fitzgerald, The Stranger by Albert Camus, The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka.
How have women in your life enforced or encouraged traditional male gender norms/expectations?	Norms don't need to enforced or encouraged, they simply *are*. If a guy does something outside the norm **everyone** will notice. That will cause the guy to feel incredibly uncomfortable and he'll double down on the norm. Norms are, by and large, good for society because they allow us to avoid a lot of unnecessary awkwardness. As far as influence goes I think what (mainly young) men pay most attention to is a) What women say they hate and b) What type of guy women date/go for.	I had a conversation with a female coworker today who literally said men should stand when a women enters the room.... ...it was strange.
HOW DO YOU ENFORCE THE PATRIARCHY?	I am a wereshitlord. When the moon is empty, I undergo a hideous transformation and stalk the night as a terrifying unholy monster. I dogcall women, I spread my legs on public transportation as widely as possible, I buy women drinks and then demand sex as recourse, I question women wearing video game shirts if they even know anything about the game theyre wearing, and I ask every woman in my line of sight out on a date, and when they respond even remotely negatively I howl in rage! The morning after I always find myself in jail, and with at least 6 new restraining orders. All sweaty, clothes torn, bruises, scratches from nails, and smelling strongly of mace. It is a terrible curse.	I HAVE CONSENSUAL SEX WITH MY GIRLFRIEND IN A NON-PLATONIC MANNER IN WHICH I CLEARLY OBJECTIFY HER BY CONSENSUALLY SEXING HER
Have you ever been in love with someone, but held back from being with that person? If so, why?	All the time. Why would I want to "be with someone" when I love them, what's in it for me? I mean I spend time with them but I do that with friends too; I cuddle friends and I cuddle lovers the action isn't much different in the last case but I guess it physically feels a bit more chemical and not necessarily better.	Ever met someone that you just clicked with on every level but they already were in a relationship since the day you met and that relationship looks like it's never going to end?
People who have been married 10+ years, how did your love change with you SO?	Before you make any decisions about marriage, /r/marriagestrike and /r/TheRedPill Take a look at /r/relationships, /r/breakups, /r/mensrightslinks and see if you're willing to take that risk. My suggestion to you is to remain single until you can't get any more hot chicks. Then get married to the best one you can get. If you eventually do get married, get a prenup and make sure she makes exactly the same income as you. Don't sacrifice yourself.	We've been together 12 years and we're 30's - 40's. It changes over time. We kind of have a relationship like your folks now and that's OK. We also have two kids under 4yo which has changed us yet again. Now we are facing the challenge of raising a family together. Frankly there isn't much time (or want) for gazing into each others eyes anymore. Sex is stale and infrequent for the most part. We are stressed and tired so the little things that used to bother us about each other flare up again and become little fights. But we're doing it, we're a team with the same focused goals. We support each other and protect each other.
Men of Reddit, I am a lady who can't have PIV - what would you like someone in my position to do?	I went through something similar. For me the solution was frightfully simple (may not work for you though). 1. I was trying to operate as a pure sapiosexual. I was not physically attracted to anyone I dated and just could not open. 2. That set of guy's didn't care and tried anyway even when I said it was painful - cease and desist. Solution 1. Dated men I found attractive and arousing. Solution 2. Only dated men who were respectful and cared whether they were causing me physical pain. I hope your solution is as fundamental. I never apologized or warned people I couldn't. Also, I insisted they get STI tested before trying anyway. Unfortunately, warning men about a lack of experience seemed to make them more aggressive. Good Luck TLDR: Only date nice people you find attractive who can respect "stop, you're hurting me."	You're asking the wrong questions. You should not be thinking about a relationship without also thinking about addressing this problem. What you are describing is something you need professional medical help with. If you can afford it, go for therapy with a qualified sex therapist. I'm not suggesting you DON'T start dating. I'm suggesting you deal with this at the same time. Get some help :) THAT should be your priority here. Good luck!
Anyone here ever meet a girl that was everything you wanted personality-wise, but nothing you wanted physically?	The whole "it's the personality that counts!" is such enormous bullshit; if there is no physical attraction present, you're doing both parties a disservice. When I extricate myself from my own predicament I might share my experiences/war-wounds.	yes. It's horribly frustrating. I feel like a horrible person for being so shallow, but I want to be massively physically attracted to the person I'm with. I can't tell you how it ends. I'm in the middle of it now.
Some men say some vaginas are better than others, others say it’s all the same. What’s the difference in different vaginas? What makes sex with a certain woman better than others?	Really the only thing that changes how they feel is if the person is fit /does kegels in my experience. I had a stint where I dated some dancers, (strippers) who of course were super fit given the nature of spinning and boy did it make a difference. I understood why wives/girlfriends got so insecure after visiting the clubs after that.	Vaginas vary as much as penises do. Her depth, tightness at her opening, tightness inside, internal heat, wetness, shape/size/color of vulva and clitories, level of sensitivity, etc can all vary wildly, and even in the same person from start to finish or where she in in her cycle. I'm not very fond of super tight/shallow situations, but sex emcompasses so much more than the physicality of our genitals. What makes the sex better with any woman is how self aware, communicative, creative, rhythmic, and enthusiastic she is, regardless of what she's working with.
Do you ever feel like you're not "allowed" to talk negatively about feminism/women in general?	Wow, really? "I'm not allowed to express negativity towards people *without those people attacking my opinion*" That's amazing. Why on Earth would you *expect* people to "allow" you to talk negatively about them? *Of course* they're going to be bothered by it; of course they're going to tell you that you're an asshole and that you can fuck right off. Don't tell me you wouldn't do the exact same thing.	Even as a woman I feel like I can't state my own opinion if it goes against women or feminism. People get super offended when I state that I am not a feminist nor do I want to be. I think the feminist movement needs to be updated to the equalatarian movement and focus on all of the inequality in our society, not just mostly women's inequalities.
Is being with two women at once really a universal fantasy for men?	No. First, gay and asexual men exist. Second, do straight and bisexual men who balk at the logistics of actually sleeping with two women at once. And so do monogamous men. And every other variation you can think of that would turn down a threesome.	If I was a guy reading that I'd think IT'S A TRAP! I'd be worried about waking up in a bathtub filled with blood, missing a kidney...
Would you be embarrassed if your gf or wife masterbated after sex?	No, why would you? Some women need more stimulation, or if you can make it a point to make sure she gets off at least once before you do them maybe she won't have to Masturbate after sex as often.	Sometimes my husband will finish first and that's fine. We will lay together and he will kiss my neck or breasts while I finish. It's still a very intimate time for us.
How did you win the genetic lottery? How did you lose it?	Win: I got the highest SAT score in my graduating class (~550) with no preparation. Lose: My brother outscored me by nearly 150 points with similar prep.	Win: I can make my foot do a crackle sound that is yucky. Loss: That crackle sound that is yucky doesn't attract women.
Those who have had a Vasectomy: are things any different during orgasm?	I've noticed a difference. Feels about 90 percent of what it used to be. Also have some aching after sexy on one side that eventually fades. Not a fan of the procedure.	Here's the thing. The way a vasectomy works is they snip the tubes that go from your testes to the sac that stores semen. So what happens is there's no more flow of sperm to the seminal vesicle (not sure on the exact wording) which means that your semen is now just salty liquid with nothing in it. It doesn't change the way you orgasm, it doesn't make it feel any different, it doesn't make jizz disappear. All it does is prevent sperm from entering the seminal fluid. **EDIT** Guys I don't have time to explain every little minuscule detail of what happens before and after a vasectomy. Here's the short list * you still have an orgasm * you still get wet dreams * you still release ejaculate * you just don't have any swimmers in it
What do you think about the whole 'woman standing next to you in a bar wanting you to say hi' thing?	Every time it's some landwhale who thinks she's hot because drunk/pussy-hooked guys actually lower themselves to get some with her. I run when I see this happening.	It's counterproductive. If you're standing next to me in a crowded area but not talking or otherwise interacting with me, I'm just going to assume you're ... you know, standing there. Doubly so if you're turned away from me.
how to tell your GF you don't really care about a certain thing she constantly talks about?	Some women are just like this. They are always talking (usually about themselves) and don't like having silence or quiet moments together. Just tell her you think its great she is interested in those things but you are not and would prefer to talk about other things. If she continues after that and just keeps talking at you then your other option is to just tune her out. That or leave.	I made a sign saying “for the love of Christ, please change the subject”. It wasn’t helpful at all. Don’t do this.
Have you ever noticed a difference between in the thinking or behavior between women who believe they are conventionally attractive vs not conventionally attractive?	In my experience, the majority of women in today's society see themselves as MUCH more attractive then they actually are. With this comes a sense of entitlement. I'd say the cause is social media and online dating sites. A 4+ can post a bikini picture online and no matter what, there will be thirsty guys slobbering all over the comment section in seconds.	The difference that I've seen is that the ones that KNOW they're attractive tend to take longer to develop interesting personalities. The ones that didn't KNOW or THINK they were attractive don't have this issue as much.
Who else feels like he should work out more when seeing beautiful women?	Meh? Most of the kinds of women who'd set me to drooling don't notice anything that isn't on their cellphone screen. I could be buffed out like Schwarzenegger and they'd still be oblivious. I work out because I want to be healthy and have a better quality of life. Getting women isn't hindered by my looks so it's a non issue for the time being.	I actually get the feeling more often when I see fit men. Beautiful women actually make me self conscious to work out on account of boner through gym attire.
What's the closest you've come to dying?	Skiing accident, went flying off trail, ended up dangling upside down off a cliff by my one remaining ski which was wedged between a rock and a tree root. Luckily someone saw me go off trail and was able to pull me up with her ski pole. Yes I was saved by a girl. No, I have no problems admitting that. I send her a Christmas/thank you card every year.	I almost got hit by a train in Holland because I didn't know the train tracks were level with pedestrian walkways. My family friend had to pull me out of the way.
How do you deal with a girl choosing between two guys?	Meet up with her ex, level with him, realise she's a vacillating bitch who shops for boyfriends like she's shopping for cars, and go have a beer with your new mate.	In any relationship, romantic or not, don't make someone a priority in your life when they don't make you a priority in theirs.
Is a girl that cooks really all that important? Why?	Because I hate doing it. Also good, hot food evokes a feeling of someone taking care of you, whereas most women are more likely to give off the entitled vibe of "why aren't *you* taking care of *me*?" If we have to sacrifice so much just to be with you, it's nice to know you actually like us and want to give us something in return.	it is because it shows that you are a self actualized human that can be self sufficient. so that means men should also know how to cook. and both men and women should know how to clean, mend things and first aid
Who is actually looking forward to having a family and why?	Yes well it's that or the priesthood both is fathrrship but God knows. Father to maybe five kids or father to hundreds of parishioners.	Jot me down as +1 for family. Not anytime soon, but I'd love to have a wife and children with her one day. There's so many family discounts to places I can't take advantage of yet because none of my friends pass for young kids. Also the love that comes with belonging to a family would be cool too.
What is something you cared about a lot when you were in your 20's that you no longer cared about when you got older?	Being the "good guy" even when the action wasn't really something i agreed with/thought would help. Just didn't want to rustle feathers. I'm a lot more honest now. I live by my own moral code and im a much better person.	Video games. I just don't have the time to care anymore. I still enjoy games, but I can't tell you everything about every game that's coming out/came out in the last/next 6 months like I used to.
Why did I buy an electric razor?	Buy a good pair of clippers. Use a razor if you're looking to be clean shaven. Just don't put yourself through an electric razor. I have no idea why you bought one either; they're shit.	The thing with electric is that it will never be as close as a blade and trying to get it to be will ruin your face. I use mine dry with light pressure, just let the motor do its thing.
When did you first realize women saw you as a potential mate?	About your update: Unless the guy in question is extremely attractive chances are that you won't get compliments, won't be hit on, that any display of sexuality or any advances are deemed creepy. Add to that the usualy shaming of the male sex drive (= rape drive according to some) and I can't see any reason why a man would think of himself as sexually attractive. On a certain level I know that some women may see me as attractive or sexy, but I can't say that NOT thinking this would be dumb or naive, as it's a legit conclusion given the information boys and men get.	Never. I might be alone in this. But dating for me is convincing someone who has no interest in me as a potential mate that they should reconsider what I have to offer. I instigate 100% of the time.
When was the last time you felt appreciated?	Woman here - when my ex said that he’d fulfil a promise that I didn’t think that he’d even remembered or cared about despite all of the other things he’d forgotten or falsely assumed. It really touched my heart but I didn’t tell him because I didn’t want to open that box again. Before that/him? Ehhhhh. Idk. It’s been some months/years since I’ve *really* felt appreciated.	My friend, whose dad just died, came up to me today between classes to say hi again. We had talked sporadically right before and after his dad died, but he's obviously been super overwhelmed. I'm surprised he was even at school. But we talked for a bit and he thanked me for sending him random memes and asked if I was free for the weekend. And that felt nice.
A guy kissed me last night. Should I tell my SO? Would you like to know?	This shit drives me nuts. How could you NOT have gotten away from the guy? If OP was unable to leave the situation that constitutes sexual assault. If you were sexually assaulted there should be consequences for the prepatrator. More likely OP willingly cheated on her SO and is now trying to bypass the guilt by skewing the recollection of events Downvote me to hell but this victimization scenario you've built sounds like a crock of shit.	Just tell him immediately, especially if honesty is important to you guys. If it happened to my SO I'd much rather hear it from her and have her explain than from someone else that saw it.
What's your last minute Halloween costume?	Not for all audiences: Poke holes in a trash bag an wear it like a shirt, then tie a piece of garden hose around your waist. You're a hose bag.	Take a page out of the office and cut out 3 circles of black construction paper and attach to yourself and say you are "3 hole punched such and such".
Men who have worked in fields dominated by women, how has your experience been?	currently working in a nursing home, 98% women employees. I'm in Administration, and I pretty much hate the work environment. A lot of cattiness, a lot of high school BS, a lot of rumors, and talking behind backs that eventually gets to me and I have to deal with. It's frankly not as glamorous as some people think.	Currently work for a University. My office is 7 middle aged women and myself. I'm about the age of their children so I get pretty much mothered. Constantly get advice on being the perfect husband and sometimes set up with their daughters friends etc.
What was your most embarrassing "dumb kid" moment?	My wife explained dermographia to me early in the morning, and I tried to see if my skin had that property. In a bleary state, I gouged a foot-long bleeding gash in my arm with my own nail -_-	I politely declined shrimp at a cocktail event when I was about 8. I had never seen shrimp before as my family was not into seafood and my mother a vegetarian. My declining statement went along the lines of "No thank you miss, I don't eat cockroaches" southern sincerely and manners included.
Where do you look to meet someone?	I’m okay with being down voted. I rarely post on Reddit. When so do so I just leave honest and genuine comments. With that said, It’s really disturbing how many men now think they are at risk of being labeled as an assaulter. When in reality, being assaulted is something women have had to struggle with every day, and it’s always been accepted as an unfortunate part of society. Dudes, you are making up a problem for yourself when your ladies actually live with real problems every day. The down votes are a reflection of this overall complacency.	A good friend of mine walked up to a girl at a train station. They have been dating for 4 years now and are getting married next year! Ya never know...
Is it OK to ask a guy out at the gym? How would I even go about it?	>I've seen countless amount of posts from the women's perspective where they say things like "Uhgh, ick, being hit on at the gym." Are men women?	1. As you said, just make sure that he's done is set or run or whatever. 2. Then only chat him up, not 30 guys in a single day. 3. "Hi, I've seen your around, I'm ScopicView" [Hi, I'm DarkHorse] "I don't want to keep you from your workout, but I wanted to know if you'd join me for a [coffee/drink/kale smoothy] later" You'll either have a date or not.
At what age did you develop a sense of how attractive you were?	When will you guys realise. Your concept of "attractive" is not entirely the same from the girls' point of view. Attractiveness for girls is a mixture of looks and the way you make them feel; a culmination of many attributes. If you look nice but are ugly on the inside, there's a chance that you are not as attractive as you have been led to believe.	I'm 21 and have recently realized that the fact that I seem to be more or less invisible to the opposite sex is probably a good sign I'm not exactly the spiciest jalapeño on the block.
What is the most hilariously/infuriatingly wrong thing you have ever heard about male biology from a grown woman?	That men and women are basically "wired" the same, sexually. This is bullshit. Women are wired for quality, men are wired for quantity. To prove this, ask *any* woman to approach, at random, 10 men and say, "I'm really horny, and need to be fucked" Ask any man to do the same, with 10 women, and see who gets fucked...	Well plenty of things on this subreddit. But in real life, my friend's mom accused me of having a boner because the zipper area of my pants was sticking out. The dreaded "jeans boner" phenomenon. So I grasped it in my hand and punched it several times to prove my penis wasn't in there.
When you "read between the lines" on somebody's dating profile, what do you really see?	"These days I'm more interested in staying in and watching Netflix then going out partying all night." I used to be super sexually adventurous and had sex with a staggering number of partners. Now I want to "settle down" with a guy who will support me and be satisfied with once a week starfish sex.	"I love to laugh"/"I love to have fun"/"I love to travel"/Emoji Spam - I'm too lazy to fill out a dating profile, so I rely on cliches to pad length like a poorly written high school essay.
Am I in the wrong for wanting alone time from my girlfriend?	It's not wrong at all; it's actually healthy and necessary. It actually sounds like she's trying to guilt or manipulate you by telling you it hurts her feelings.	No you're not. You need to build a healthy communication with your girlfriend. Sometimes I get back from work and I just want to listen to music, watch a movie or play video games without talking about my day. I tell my girlfriend that I that I need to clear my head for a while and that we'll talk around dinner. She has absolutely no problem with it and uses this free time to do things she needs to do. As long as you explain that with empathy and make it clear that it's just about recharging your batteries, she won't be offended.
As a man, how do you manage the loneliness?	Invest in good headphones & update your playlist, walk around at night on the weekend & when you see a bar with your people go in, order tequila & wash it down with half a pint. Finish the pint next to a group of your people. If they make conversation great, if not take another beer & try another eye contact. Rinse and repeat.	Been there, and I’ll tell ya, you’re going to want to make some friends. Loneliness can get away from you real quick, and go real bad.
[NSFW] What does it feel like to have your balls sucked?	I guess it'd be similar to having your clit played with? It's similar to the feeling of having the penis proper sucked but they're more sensitive to both pleasure and pain. That's why you've got to be careful with them, and why we don't want them sucked the whole time, just like 25\-50&#37; of the time.	The balls are like a priceless Ming Dynasty vase in display case. They are mostly to be looked at. You can handle them but only carefully. They are fragile. They are of great value to the owner. Reckless activity in the vicinity of them is strictly prohibited.
How do I get women to view me sexually?	You avoid the friend zone by never becoming friends with women. I never become friends with a woman until after I've slept with her. Just be honest about your intentions, if you pretend to be her friend, she'll want to be your friend and won't be attracted to you. It's perfectly fine to be friendly, while also expressing a sexual desire, as long as it isn't aggressive. Let them know from the outset that you have enough friends, you aren't interested in being friends, but you are interested in them though. Start of sexual, get to know them after, if it doesn't seem like a good fit that's when you become friends	There's already a lot of 'Lift weights' in this thread. While it certainly helps, you don't have to be muscular to get laid. Being a muscular dude won't magically get you out of the friendzone, because you still won't know how to behave around women in a way that makes them see you as a sexual being. - Be confident. - Be friendly. - Be funny. - **Be flirty.** - Don't put them on a pedestal. - **Be aggressive.** No, don't go around molesting girls. But make moves and make it clear you are not looking for a friend. - Don't be a doormat. €dit: Bolded the important parts.
Fit men of Reddit, how have your physical standards / preferences changed since becoming “fit”?	Before lifting I thought Bruce Lee was jacked af god. Now I look at him and think, “wow, he’s actually not even that muscular.”	I've become a lot more critical. A woman who is skinny but without elements of athletic fitness does not intimidate me any more.
How important is physical affection to you in a relationship?	I prefer non-physical after a couple of traumatic events in my last relationship. My love languages are gifting and gestures, but not physical usually. Maybe after some time I would like to cuddle someone I feel safe with, but that's basically it. The thing is though, a lot of people want sex in a relationship and I can't offer that. If I find someone who can respect my needs but also aren't asexual, I will be chill with them having a sex buddy because I totally understand that it's super important for some people. I would like them to be only commited to our relationship only though, outside of the sex buddy.	Non sexual physical affection is important to me. Hand holding on a long drive, cuddling on the couch, a quick shoulder rub while cooking. Super reassuring and comforting to me.
Guys who do not go to bars/clubs to pick-up girls, where do you go instead?	I don't fucking pick up girls. I meet people in general, and get to know them, and sometimes ask them out, and I also use OKcupid. The majority of new women I meet are from ballroom dancing.	Do things where you can expect to encounter people you don't know, and where the activity gives you a few hours cover to get to know them easily. It can be parties (especially if you have a wide social circle, less so if your friends are a close-knit group), it can be a group/outing club for an interest (ex: I'm in an outdoor activities group), concerts (pit is best), conventions, etc.
How does it make you feel if a girl submits herself all to you sexually?	It's a total turn off and I interpret it as laziness. I'm not looking for a real doll. I'm looking for someone who wants to do nasty stuff with me and who is going to participate and has their own preferences and things they want to try. Sometimes I wanna use them sure. But sometimes I like them taking the lead.	You people who say its lazy are doing it wrong man. Submission is a mental game not just physical. It doesn't mean she wants to starfish while you do your thing, she wants to be told what to do. I find it super hot because theres someone there saying "getting you off is what gets me off" basically. Also girls who push back a bit and test your dynamic are real hot, like they want to be submissive but won't make it so easy.
All you extroverted, outgoing men (if you exist on reddit)...how do you feel about introverted women?	I want girls like you to come out, and not hide behind excuses like "but it's just the way I am" or "I don't feel ready". Being introverted is not inherently bad but it's stifling in many ways. It's limiting for yourself and doesn't provide much room to grow. You see those guys who are full of energy and enthusiasm, and part of you likes them because you admire those qualities. I want girls like you to realize that gaining that sort of outlook and energy is totally doable and not hard at all. I want you to be the best, most vibrant version of yourself. I don't want to "change you" or "turn you into something you're not", I just want *more of you* because people who start out as introverts are nearly always more interesting at their cores. Ex-introverts become the best extroverts!!	Being an introvert doesn't necessarily mean being shy. It means that you need to be alone to recharge your batteries. I am an introvert but you can be sure that I have absolutely no problem being very talkative, throwing jokes every two minutes, and chatting up people I don't know when I'm invited at a party full of people. However, I can't do that every day of the week and I will need to come back to my house to watch a movie, play a video game, or play guitar to recharge my batteries. Also, the world isn't a video game with two teams: Introverts Vs Extroverts. Most people are in the between, and while we always lean on a side, we tend to evolve as we mature and go out of our comfort zone.
Guys of Reddit: Do you honestly look at females and think they are hot, even when you have a girlfriend?	I want the whiteknight mods of this sub to sotp putting these fucking ridiculous tags on every post that triggers them cause its not worded PC or whatever.	It's human nature to check people out. It's nearly impossible to stop that, relationship or not. It's disrespectful for people to blatantly check others out in front of their SO and just not care what they think. But being attracted to what you're naturally attracted to doesn't equate to "he's gonna cheat." Don't worry so much.
When do you tell your friend that his girlfriend js a gold-digger?	so what makes you think your friend is blind. He sees what you see. He's not dumb and knows he's being used just like she's being used for her bimbo looks. That is often the kind of interaction men with money make with golddiggers. Unless he's a dumbass who needs his friends to point out the obvious, he knows. LOL, does he think she actually finds him fascinating/sweet/cool/interesting/any of the above? No, no he does not care. He cares about having an annoying little airhead on his arm as eye candy and you getting all outraged is... laughable. He knows where his money is going, he knows what he paid for.	So my first question is about his ex, what's her relationship with your friend? Did he dump her and does she want him back, does she just dislike this girl because she's dating her ex boyfriend?
What do you wish you would have known before moving in with your SO?	Everything with my SO is great, but I'm not 10 years older than her. Seriously that age gap is a major red flag.	I thought you she would hold me up to her rigid standards; instead, she has sunk to mine. It is a hollow victory.
What do you wish women would understand more?	Doing some housework and cooking is NOT the same as throwing your back out doing hard labour all day coming home with cut up bleeding hands and swollen feet, etc The time of men working hard and women staying at home is over. Yet I still encounter women who are perfectly happy to try to make men pay for their comfort. I love cooking, I don't mind cleaning. I would love having an easy life where all I have to do is cook and clean. I just don't love doing those things for someone who has been sitting on her fat lazy ass doing arts and crafts or playing video games all day while maybe cleaning one thing. I will only respect a woman who works as much and as hard as I do. Get a job.	You need to tell a lot of us if you want us to just listen or if you want us to provide solutions.
I understand the allure of a proper blowjob, but what's attractive about watching a woman swallow another man's semen (or more specifically, lots of men's semen)?	Holy fuck all these comments and not one of you pointing out the honest truth. Some guys like to see a woman demeaned and humiliated. Fuck all that "she enjoys my cum" bullshit lol. That's only when it's one on one. The scenes with multiple dicks and loads of cum are because it turns some of us on to see a woman used like a fuck toy with total disregard for her feelings or enjoyment. It's that feeling when you crush a sports rival on the field except you're doing it to a woman. You totally destroy her and unload your worst on her. You're conquering her and using her body as the spoils.	for me the attractive part is that the girl is enjoying something she would usually be disgusted by because she is too horny to care. Of course the porn star is not horny and is being disgusted, but that's not what I see when I watch the video.
Okay, Men - Yesterday I asked what you got your SO - now I want to know... What did YOU get??	A bunch of button downs from Express. A new stage microphone, a microphone shield (so I don't need to soundproof a room), a new jacket and some other odds and ends. All around, I'd give this Christmas a 7/10. 8/10 with rice.	My SO is still asleep and everything's still under the tree and I'm losing my mind even though I'm 31 years old
Do any of you guys ever go through a nihilistic slump where nothing matters and there no reason to anything?	Not really.....I mean when I was younger, sort of. I hated the idea of going to law school or doing some mundane office job. So now I'm going to become a Police/SWAT officer and I can't stop smiling. So exciting.	I'm currently feeling that way. I continue on as normal, because there's no point in not living just because you won't be concious to reflect on your life.
Does media coverage of extreme feminism ideals make you afraid to approach women?	I don't think it's terribly extreme to not be interested in dating a total stranger I just met at the store in the check out line. I don't think it's creepy necessarily, just not something I'm willing to do. Talk to me sure, but I will not go on a date with you.	It's affected me - going to social dances is a common answer given when guys ask where to meet women. But after reading a lot about how women feel like they just want to dance and not be hit on (both in the media and my Facebook feed), I gave up on that option. I never approached women on the street or in grocery stores, so nothing changed there (will probably stop me in the future though).
Why don't you want to get a girlfriend?	Biology. 1. Women want a man who is genetically superior, and who will, willingly, support her offspring until they die; 2. Men want to fuck everything that dresses nicely on a Friday night. Mismatch.	My last two relationships were 3 and 5 years respectively and after the last one I realized I like my freedom more than I like having a girlfriend. I like eating where I want to eat, leaving the bars when I'm ready to leave, going on random trips without having to ask permission or working around another schedule. I was tied down for so long I forgot what freedom was like and I'm not giving it up anytime soon.
What 3 books have you read that you think expanded your mind? Changed your view of the world? Had the most knowledge?	Atlas Shrugged. It's dense and at times clungly and plodding but wow! a real eye-opener into who owes what to whom. Anthology of Shakespeare's plays to see that human drama has always been the same through out history. Finally, Ecclesiastes from the Bible to see that there truly is 'nothing new under the Sun,.	Crime and Punishment. Hands down my favorite book; incredibly philosophical and thrilling. Basically you go into the mind of a troubled young man who decides to murder his landlady for the greater good of society, as she was known for ripping people off. You follow his reasoning behind it and his attempts to avoid being caught.
How do you know your attractiveness?	I feel confident in my appearance. Self-worth is key. Whether others decide to acknowledge my good taste or not is on them. :)	After having lost fat and packed on muscle and improved sense of style I'd say 1. Smiles from strangers instead of eye-rolls- both sexes 2. People are more likely to help me in all kinds of situations 3. I can be a gigantic prick sometimes and people tend to overlook it more 4. Lots more sex. 5. Lots more compliments
Why does it seem like height is so important to women in the real world, but on Reddit not a single girl cares?	I am one of those women who will only date guys 6' and up. Sorry not sorry. Shortness is uggggly. To be honest it short males just don't seem like they can protect me like a tall guy can. You may be the greatest guy in the world but I'm still not gonna let you touch me. A for your question: I think a lot of women here lie because they simply feel bad for having shallow preferences. Stereotypically women are "supposed" to care a lot about personality and shit, so the height thing doesn't play into this narrative. No woman wants to be seen as a shallow bitch, which is what she'll be called if she talks about hard height limits.	What I've seen really often is a woman saying "she doesn't mind if a guy is short" and following it up with the implication that he still needs to be close to as tall or taller than them. But since they're saying 5'8 is okay at a height of 5'6 themselves, "I don't mind short". Plus, there's a tendency on the internet for people to post feel-good responses that let them avoid even the implication that they're being shallow. Some women would never say "I couldn't date short" to a guy who was actually *asking* if being short was a problem - they'd only say it to people who were taller than them or women.
Fellow men, what the hell just happened?	/r/pussypass in fucking action. No man would have gotten away with that. You should've knocked her ass to the ground to teach her a lesson.	This stuff happens all the time. I'm a gay guy and I had a woman accuse me of staring at her tits. I was just looking around and I made brief eye contact with her and continued on searching for male eye candy. She struts over and yells at me in front of a crowd. Fortunately, a few minutes after she departed, my then boyfriend came back from a nearby CVS, and kissed me on the mouth. The same folks who were there saw that and shifted their eyes towards the woman who quickly gathered her things and slipped away. Dignity restored.
What’s wrong with being called a nice guy?	Well, when I was a young man, nice guy meant what we now call the friend zone. You can’t be hot and nice at the same time.	Thanks to internet "nice guy" is considered to be a douchebag who acts nice and feels like they are entitled with getting into her panties just because they were nice to someone. So maybe they don't want to be associated with that kind of nice guy term.
Men, who was the classiest woman you ever had the pleasure of dating in your life thus far? What made her so special?	Always wore dresses, had a brilliant smile that lit up a room but it was rare to see. I don’t think she owned any yoga pants, ugg boots, crocs, Nutella, Netflix, Social Media, all the ‘basic shit’ that makes people...well, boring. She didn’t have it in her life and as a result her world didn’t revolve around it.	My current gf. She is unfailingly kind, friendly, and outgoing, even to people she just met, which is a rarity in general but especially in NY. She's whip-smart, confident, funny, independent, a great hostess, dresses well with a unique sense of style, generally game for everything and a joy to be around in any social situation. The biggest thing though, is that she can always carry a conversation in a way that involves everybody if need be, but is also an attentive and curious listener.
My girlfriend is manipulative, using techniques to get what she wants. what do?	First of all, since it sounds like you are pretty much broke anyway, you should just leave and pick up the pieces in an environment where you aren't being manipulated. It will be tough financially, but you'll get through it. If you refuse to leave you're a dumbass, but perhaps you can make the situation a little better by not letting her walk all over you. Google "passing shit tests" and then apply what you learn.	Emotionally detach yourself from her, put on a fake smile and dump her when you're in a financial position where you can. Don't get stuck into this one, being alone is better than a relationship like that.
Dad's of reddit, do you ever regret having kids?	Not one bit. Is it demanding? Sure. Is there frustration? Yes. Is there sacrifice? God yes. But there is nothing--NOTHING--like the joy of being a dad. Rocking your child to sleep, seeing all of their "firsts", experiencing the wonder of life through a fresh pair of eyes...it is like reliving childhood. 10/10 would recommend	No. Having kids was one of the defining events of my life. And it changed me fundamentally. I don't recommend it for everyone. It takes a lot out of you, emotionally, physically, and yes, financially. But it also can make you a better person, less self centered, more in touch with your mortality, and it has the potential to give you the most rewarding relationships of your life. No one is ready to have kids. Before I had kids I thought of myself as invulnerable and probably immortal. I now know that I can be hurt, deeply. I'm driven to keep my kids healthy and happy. And I have great hopes that they will be better people, smarter, kinder, more capable, than I am.
How do I break up with my depressed/suicidal girlfriend?	Wow @ all the commenters who say "record the conversation" or "call the cops". I can understand where it's coming from, but what a cynical way to approach things. That said, you seem to be on top of things, actually. You know this situation is bad for you and you want out, and you seem determined to do it. The only advice I can give is that if she has any support anywhere-- other friends or maybe another family member-- give them a heads up just after you break up with her, so they can look out for her a bit. Good luck.	First rule of any relationship/friendship/whatever: never let yourself be pulled into the water while trying to save them from drowning. You come first. **Period.** If being with her is negatively affecting you, then you need to end it. As for how to actually do so, I don't know. Soon and definite (don't give her any wiggle room to deny its over) is just about the only advice I can give.
What are your thoughts on your significant other being able to track your location?	I feel like anyone that’s disagreeing with this might not want to share their location with their SO because of shady reasons. I share my locations with my family, parents included, and I would have no problem sharing it with a SO because I have nothing to hide, and I know what the benefits are of it. I don’t use it to creep. If there’s trust in your relationship, what harm would it cause? But 8 months might be too soon for this, your call on that.	When my now husband and I were LDR, we would travel 3 hours every weekend to see each other, leaving around 3 am on Monday morning to make it to work on time. We ended up turning it on with each other for the “dead in the ditch” scenario. Really helped when my car broke down en route and he could come right to me to fix it too. It has its uses, but we also had no trust issues nor did we use it to check up on each other.
How many guys here didn't have a girlfriend until after high school?	Never kissed, fucked, or had a girlfriend until after graduating high school. I've always been a bit of a late bloomer	Twenty one here, I still haven't. There are lots of reasons, but chief among them is that I don't really put myself out there (and I'm not attractive enough to compensate for that).
What's your "blind spot"? In what areas of relatively common knowledge are you woefully ignorant?	I'm a computer scientist and I detest algorithms. Try to avoid them whenever possible as far as proofs go. I'm also pretty ignorant of geography.	I can't spell. At all. It just makes no sense! Some one in the IRC chat once told me they thought I was doing it on purpose. I wasn't. :(
Men who are very frugal and money-wise what tips could you give us young guys?	DON'T GO INTO DEBT. Life-threatening/ruining situation is the only exception. Cook at home, use everything (like instead of throwing them out, you can gather and freeze bones and then make bone broth that will give you basically free soups for a week) Buy clothes in outlets. You can get amazing stuff for next to nothing, but you need to hunt. If you need something specific, buy off brand. Don't drink, don't smoke, don't do drugs. And if you do, do it in moderation. Those are things that ruin budgets of poorer people the most.	Don’t upgrade your lifestyle right when you get a pay raise. You were living just fine before so why change?
WESTERN men: Does it bother you if your gf drinks and/or gets drunk?	No Everyone is expected to drink, there is nothing shameful about it in Western society (unless you are an alcoholic).	The only two reasons I would ever want my SO to ***not*** drink with me is if they: A) Were an alcoholic B) Were planning on driving/some other reason for sobriety Without me, it's whatever floats your boat (still keeping A and B in mind)
Men who have had the "I have a boyfriend" line pulled on you when you weren't remotely interested in the girl, how'd it go?	Me: "Hi, you are really cute and I'd love to get to know you" Her: "Aww you're so sweet but I have a boyfriend" Me: "Lucky guy! Enjoy each other".	"is anybody using this stool?" "I have a boyfriend!!" "Is he using this stool? I'd like to sit with my wife"
men of reddit, is sex any different if the girl is significantly taller than the guy?	Never had sex. Height is no barrier to relationship. I'm 5'8" and that is considered tall in Southeast Asia where I run around in.	Doggystyle is a little more difficult because her legs are longer so her hips are higher than yours, so she'll have to sprawl out a little wider for your bodies to align.
Why do I fall for girls so damn quickly?	Because instead of actually trying to fuck them or actually fucking them, you spend time imagining your non-existent 'love boat stories' with them. It's not exactly fucked-up, but it's a bit messed-up and a bit off.	You have no options so when a girl pops in you have +1 option. Then when you dont get her you cry about it until a new option comes along. Infatuation pushes you to try since you dont try in your daily life Solution: realise every girl you dont talk to is an option for a girlfriend.
Whats an unfortunate truth every man has to accept at some point?	If you don't have money your chances with pretty women decrease exponentially. You'll have to settle for other people's rejects	No one is coming to help you and you need to do this yourself. The sooner you realise this, the more control you take and the prouder you can be when it's done.
How to talk to my male friend about women not approaching him (feeling ugly)?	I may be late in saying this, but tell him to get off his ass and do something about his mindset. Specifically, to stop caring about other people's perception of him. That's not gonna do him any good in the long run. Is he a real nerd? Then get him to own that nerdiness. Try to convince him that it may be a good idea to get a new wardrobe that reflects *him* especially at work. Also, haircut, again have him find one he likes.	Nothing you tell him is really going to change anything, he’s locked him self into that mindset. Ideally, he’ll need to change a few things about his appearance, contacts or lasik to ditch the glasses, change his clothing style, hair style too perhaps, get out more, and work on his confidence. I swear to god, women pick up on confidence likes sharks do blood.
Men of Reddit, what are some things you do to maintain your own well being and happiness?	Compare the old me to new me. Muscles, money, confidence, friends and am about to buy my first house all at the ripe age of 19. :) Edit: LSD is also good	I like to do cooking projects. Spending a couple hours in the kitchen whipping up something new is cathartic for me, plus I get to eat at the end of it all.
How gropey/handsy are you and your partner? Is it important to you?	I grope my girlfriend constantly. She has only complained if I do it too overtly in public. Don't worry about what a bunch of fat sjw's think. You and your SO sound happy with each other, and that's all that should matter to you.	We're constantly touching. It would be a big deal for me if she didn't like it. It's a show of affection, not objectification.
What is your "I'm the douchebag boyfriend story"?	I once dated a girl who I didn't find that attractive physically. She was really nice and awesome to hangout with though. I took her virginity, cheated on her with two other chicks, then dumped her all in one month.	I had a FB once who didn't have a car. She would get her "friend", who was obviously head-over-heels in love with her and her complete slave to drive her to my house for booty calls. The first time she made him wait in the car, the after that I let her invite him in and he got to play my consoles on the big screen while we banged. I've never had a dude hate me so much, but force himself to be so polite. I enjoyed that part as much as the sex, maybe even more. Not sure if this technically counts but it's the #1 story that comes to mind from your prompt.
Do any of you actually *like* emotionally needy or emotionally high maintenance girls?	As a Mentally Ill person the replies on here are making me sad. No one cares about us. No one at all.	I tend to like moderately to highly emotional girls, because I have a very small range of emotion most of the time and it's nice to have someone who complements that. I have also been told that my emotional disconnect makes it easier for me to comfort her or give advice.
At what age did you grow out of your party phase?	As long as you’re not using this “Party Phase” euphemism as an excuse to get trashed and be reckless all the time. There is a time to grow up and starting acting mature and professional. It doesn’t mean that you can’t have some drinks or occasionally party… Bottom line, if you’re in your 30’s going to the bar/club every weekend and getting plastered… you’re not really “enjoying life” and you definitely need to grow up. Question, how much of your partying involves altering your chemical state?	My party phase died out in my mid-twenties. I still like having fun and drinking some beers with the buds don’t get me wrong but we are more akin to the guys from King of the Hill than Jersey Shore. We’re all chill, drink a few beers and just talk. I still hit it pretty hard a few times a year but constantly going out drinking/partying not so much.
If you could go back to when you were 18 would your decision about your education have change, how?	Take useful classes. Business law, accounting, marketing would be more useful than the "fun" Quantum Mechanics classes I took instead.	I'd have learned a trade. It took me years of college and 25k in student debt to realize I'd be miserable behind a desk all day. Now what I do for a living has nothing to do with anything I studied in college and I can't see myself working in another industry.
How do you "freshen up" quickly before sex?	I take a bath every day and shave everything, so I don't usually need to freshen up before sex. If I'm feeling particularly gross, I'll hop in the tub and use the handheld faucet to wash myself off.	Wet washcloth with warm water. Scrub gently. Pat dry with towel. I used to really like talcum powder, for staving off swamp ass throughout the day. I'd buy it in those little travel-sized containers. So portable and convenient! But of course, now I've seen all the TV lawyer ads, which solemnly promise that Johnson & Johnson is patiently waiting for its chance to use baby powder to make me grow ovaries, which will then grow tumors inside them and kill me. Betting on tap water not to fuck me up *too* badly. But who even knows anymore?
Very new girlfriend is thinking about getting back with her ex. What do I do?	I would tell her to figure things out and come back to you if she wants. At this point, you guys aren't even exclusively dating anymore (at least emotionally) so there's no point in trying to hang on to her. You can try to explain things to her all you want, but sometimes you have to let her figure things out through experience. If this girl really does mean a lot to you, be a good friend to her and be there for her when the grade-A douche canoe hurts her. Staying with her romantically isn't fair to you when she's splitting her emotions multiple ways. The disagree button is in full effect today...	If you have to fight to keep her, you don't have her in the first place. It's like ripping off a bandaid, but I'd recommend taking the initiative and ending things yourself. Even if you "win her over" she might end up going with him again behind your bank.
What is the number 1 rule on your Bro Code?	I just assumed naturally, that when I tell the guys things, they aren't going to turn around and contact my girlfriend and rat me out. I had a guy do that to me once when I made a joke about my girlfriend to him and he tried to finagle his way into a relationship with her by breaking us up. It only ended up causing a fight. Anyway, it was low class. Whenever guys tell me things like they are cheating or whatever, I don't tell anyone that stuff. I also don't play games with ultimatums or second chances. He betrayed me once and that was it. I still hung out with him, but I never told him anything worthwhile again.	If your bro asks seriously for help, you do it. Doesn't matter if you feel shitty, if he really needs you, buckle down and help him. I've had to ask, and I've been asked. You value it because if you need them, they're there. Just kinda sucks when you have to drive 30 minutes to help them dissemble a keggerator and pack it up for moving.
What happened that you decided to change your life?	Kept myself running in the same circle Alchohol/Drugs Drama & just certain people. I lost myself at a certain point & I really had 2 serve myself a cold dish realize my future, my goals, cutting ppl frm my life it was way too much & my potential and mty worth are way more than I was subjecting myself to	Realised I was watching anime on a Friday night by myself at University whist people where out having adventures and friendships like the ones I idolised in the very shows I watched.
Gentleman, what are your thoughts on how relatively little support there is for abused men compared to abused women?	As long as feminism keeps pushing for women are always the victim and keep dismissing false claims it will never change. i dont think the majority of men care enough to change it until they hit that "it happened to me" time.	On the radio a few weeks ago i heard an interview with a male survivor of domestic abuse. His story ended with his girlfriend having kicked him so hard his testicles ruptured. The entire story up until that point had me at waning interest and ambivalent thoughts. The fact that, at the end of telling the story, he was crying so much he was unable to get his breath. That hit me hard. I learnt alot from that interview.
Gents, what made you walk out on a date?	She over used the words baby-daddy, queen, king, princess and deserve. It's a little cold, but I stood up and dropped $40 on the table. I the looked her in the eye and said. This is for the food I ordered, not for you. I'm sure you are used to men you barley know leaving money for you on the table or your dresser before they leave.	One time a "date" took me to a pyramid scheme meeting. I was so amused I stuck around for a while and only walked out when they tried to get me to sign up. I should of walked out sooner lol! But the dates that I ended quickly have been things like treating waitstaff poorly and keeping the conversation about themselves. I can't stand people who brag and talk themselves up endlessly.
Have you ever assumed someone's behavior meant attraction and made a move, only to find out you were mistaken? What happened and how'd you feel?	Opposite situation: men and women are often attracted to me because apparently I give up lots of signals that I'm attracted. None of that is conscious. I'm asexual, but also autistic, so I had no idea. My ex calls them my "victims". Edit: I'm heteroromantic.	Had a girl at work ask "would you take me out?" and said "I'd take you out" over the course of two days who turned me down when I asked her out. That was a confusing situation.
Men of reddit what reflexive moment are you most proud of?	I have always been really empathetic and wish I could find a way to show it, even if it was through the smallest action. I eventually managed to train myself to automatically do small courtesies, such as holding the door open, helping pick up dropped objects, etc., for strangers regardless of their appearance. It seems simple but it took awhile to develop a consistent habit of doing so.	Bending over to tie my shoe when someone on the team decided to kick a ball at my face. Caught it and slammed it down without looking up. Everyone saw, felt like a giant.
Why do you get approach anxiety and what can we girls do to help?	Don't assume a guy is "creepy" just because you think he is unattractive and showing interest in you. There are creepers out there, but girls really overuse that term and it really stigmatizes alot of nice guys.	Why I get approach anxiety. I don't know how she'll act when I talk to her. Some chicks can give off that major bitchy vibe and kill the ego. How to help -Don't put all the conversational work on the guy. If you ask questions too it takes off a huge load on the guy.
What does male sexual desire feel like?	You know, I've never thought about this before, but to sum it up... I feel a bit warmer If I'm particularly aroused, might dick actually feels... tighter? Just due to it expanding so. I might even describe that as almost sort of feeling sore. Maybe some sort of gut sensation as well? I don't really know.	Female reading this thread and I am totally flummoxed. None of this sounds remotely like female sexual desire. I am super interested. More posts please. Edit 1: What I am hearing sounds way more like what I think about when I think about *food*. Edit 2: What is absolutely bizarre is that none of you are talking about what specifically is happening to your bodies. Your outward actions and thought processes are being heavily prioritized over physical sensation. This is so NOT analogous to how I would describe female desire.
How can I make my girlfriend feel attractive?	You can't. She has to decide that for herself. You might be able to demonstrate that you do find her attractive, but you can't *make someone* believe anything, AFAIK. Just like you can't force a junkie to quit drugs just by putting them in a rehab program: they have to *want it* in order for change to happen.	Maybe try complimenting her outside the bedroom as well. For example, my boyfriend will always grab my ass or boobs (at appropriate times) or when I'm getting dressed he just watches me and will say things like "I fucking love your ass" or "you have the most amazing body" or "you're so fucking hot". It always makes me feel wanted and attractive.
What's your "screw it all I'm gonna treat myself" meal?	If it's just for me - a slab of sauteed calf's liver with calvados and beef jus, pommes fondant and grilled asparagus.	After a really tough/awesome day at work, maybe like once a summer, I'll call ahead to the crab shack. On my way home I'll swing by and pick up a dozen steamed blue crabs. On the commute home the smell is so amazing and the crabs are steaming up the windows. I'll dip my finger in the bag and eat a little of the spicy Old Bay seasoning to hold me over at red lights. Once I get home I put on a ratty t-shirt, line the coffee table with newspaper, and put two cold Natty Bohs within reach. Pop on a movie and start smacking dem babies. Crabs are an expensive treat and usually you eat them with a large group for special occasions. Getting a whole dozen to myself makes me feel like a decadent Roman emperor or something. I cackle like a mad man.
What's the most unrealistic thing (advice, story, etc) you've read on AskMen?	There is a frightening number of people who seem to think placating or appeasing women into somehow being attracted to you is a valid dating strategy. The general advice that boils down to "be less masculine" that constantly gets thrown around here is incredibly misguided. Hell, there's already three comments in this thread alone that fit the criteria of bullshit I just listed. AskMen can get weirdly anti-male at times. And of course the whiteknight downvotes proving my point. Don't worry guys, if you prostrate yourself enough she can't help but get wet for you!	"Oh, your state has a stupid law/unreasonable politician/bad school? Move to a different state." Thanks genius. I'll say goodbye to all my friends and family, quit my job and list my house right away.
What impact do your career and finances have on dating?	There is absolutely nothing wrong with you, other than maybe you should network with more like minded men for friendship. Look at it this way, there are a SHIT ton of unhappy marriages, families, and dysfunctional children. Marriage is something that needs to die. Nobody should get married. Most people had kids in the past because they had to. That was there retirement. Thats not true anymore. Kids and lifelong SOs are not inherently bad things, but not everyone wants them. And its an option for more and more people. Your life might not go the way you think it will, and in ways the current you would not like. But thats true if you walk the other path too.	You need to consider why money is important to you. I'm career oriented and I value saving and investing for the future, because I never want money to be an issue in my life. Not going out with my friends because of money would be the exact opposite of what I want. Love, friendship, and family are what drive me to work hard and be disciplined. What's driving you?
"Modern males can be deeply unhappy and unsatisfied with their place in the world, and have no clear idea how to fix it." How much do you agree, and what's your personal solution?	I think it can apply to both men and women. Personally, I've never felt terribly unsatisfied with my place in the world. Functionally, I'm an atheist-bordering-on-nihilist, but I've always been able to pick up the shovel and dig my way out of whatever shit has arisen. It's taken a lot of work and shitty experience, but nothing worth doing or having is ever easy. If you miss high school football, there's no reason you can't join a local football group or see if your company has a team they sponsor or something.	Honestly? I don't even know how the fuck to *be* a modern man. There are so many mixed messages, and so much toxic social baggage. No matter what I do, it feels like I'm never "man" enough for anyone. I'm 31, BTW. I thought I'd figure this out eventually, but it's only gotten less clear over time.
Married friend confided into me a huge secret, how do I tip off her husband?	Best advice: shut the fuck up. It really is none of your business. You should never get between a mama bear and her cub, and don't *ever* get involved in your friends relationships. They are adults, they'll sort it out.	Divorce lawyer here. I've dealt with this situation on four prior occasions. Your friend is so fucked. Before you tell him, you need to realize that this will probably be 'the' defining movement in his life where everything changed. He's happily married one moment, bankrupted by divorce and child support the next, while being a weekend father. This type of bitterness is life consuming. It swallows a person, consumes them, and can prevent a normal life. Tread carefully, and respect enormity of what you are telling him.
Are really tiny breasts a dealbraker for you?	I dunno op, maybe you should post some pics so we can better answer your question. Seriously though, I like em small. I also like the girl to be a little insecure about it, because relieving insecurities makes me feel good, so long as it's not a constant, self-destructive thing. EDIT: downvotes for an opinion, I love it	I don't really know what "extremely small" means but i do know that there are a bunch of subreddits out there that are dedicated to pics of women with very small breasts. AKA THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE INTO VERY SMALL BREASTS.
Former average guys who started lifting and got buff. Was there a big difference in how much attention you got from girls or were you disappointed because it wasn't as much as you thought it would be?	Puberty hit me like a truck. I was always short, and sort of 'cute' then over the course of a year and a half I grew about 1foot. I stayed almost the same weight due to my extensive running, a few years later, and I've definitely filled out. Roughly the same height, but I'm about 20kg heavier. Attention went up after puberty, but it's definitely gone up moreso since then as I improved my wardrobe and the way I held myself.	It was noticeable. Though I don't know if that was because I looked better, or that I carried my head a little higher as I had more confidence. I suspect a bit of both. I was out the other night though and a female friend asked to feel my arms and stuff, which was quite funny! I've felt so much better about my body since going to the gym. I feel much more capable.
My GF is starting her Army basic training this week. The kicker is that she'll be bunking and showering with dudes. How should I deal with this?	She's going for basic training, not to hook up with her barracks mates. Some guys are going to see her naked or at the very least scantily clad. That's pretty much all that is likely to happen. Why is that such a huge deal?	Honestly what can you do? You can't change her showering arrangements. You can't change who she bunks with. Do you honestly expect her to quit because you are uncomfortable?
Why is it that people ask if you drink coffee or soda if you mention you don't drink or do drugs?	Caffeine is absolutely a drug, if you drink caffeine you do drugs. I've tried every drug. Caffeine is by far my favorite one.	I think they're just trying to figure out where your line is, amigo. No need to let it make you cross.
What do you think of CEO Sheryl Sandberg's advice that girls should date a bunch of bad boys before settling down with a dependable guy?	I disagree with Sandberg's advice myself, but this is the advice that men get about women. Men get told that they should fuck all kinds of hot crazy girls when they're young and then find a nice sweet innocent girl to marry.	This is part of the reason why partner count matters to me in dating. I want someone who is looking for a good match from the start, not someone who thinks it's fun to date around with a bunch of douchebags and assholes, before settling down with a "safe" guy. I'm not a dating retirement home. I won't be the guy she falls back on. I am an equal, and as an equal, I'll decide whether or not I date a girl, and if I think she's dating me because I'm dependable and she's had her fun, I'm going to have a serious problem.
Men with stressful jobs, what does your SO do (or what do you wish your SO would do) to help make it better?	Take care of the home life. Keep the house clean, have a good meal ready for him when he gets home, make household decisions yourself when possible.	From my experience, the most important part of anything you decide to do is this: Remember that you volunteered to do it out of love, and never use it as leverage against him. Nothing ruins a favor like secretly keeping count.
How do I call off this date?	"Hey, I actually don't think it'll workout so I'm cancelling our date" "Hey, I'm afraid that I've decided to cancel our date, I'm just not feeling it any more" "Oi, no date, ain't interested' (if you wanna be a cunt) Not that difficult, imo. Be direct about it, if she isn't interested she'll only feel relieved. If she is interested then she fucked up -- her feelings might be hurt, but that's the risk of this whole dating thing.	In my opinion, you should wait it out. If she said she wants to go on another date with you, take her at her word for it rather than overreact to a single days interactions. Confirm the date and plan it if you really like her. That being said, if she goes cold and doesn’t respond, move on and relish that you were right.
What is the one book you would recommend to a young man just starting out?	Atlas Shrugged, What's the Matter with Kansas, Guns Germs and Steel, The God Delusion, Liberalism is a Mental Disorder, and a bunch of other idealistic crap	Models by Mark Manson. It gives you a good overview about how to live and prioritize your life, and he'll suggest reading more books too :)
Men of Reddit how thought they'd never get a girlfriend, how did you eventually get one?	I think men really work up in their heads how hard it is to get a date. I mean sure, you need to make a few base minimums. Workout, get fit. You don't have to be super ripped or bodybuilder spec, but it really helps. Women notice. Get social, talk to people everywhere you go. Even if they're not friendly back, if you're forced to interact with someone (like in customer service or something) be nice and polite to them and try and make conversation. Smile. Carry those skills over to talking to women you interact with. When you can make a good conversation and make a good impression, ask them out	I started asking out girls at the age of 14. I was rejected over and over and over and over again. It was incredibly depressing and terrifying and made worse by the fact that I couldn't make friends either. I would have been a denizen of /r/foreveralone if it had existed at the time. When I was 22 and in my final semester of college, a girl said yes when I asked her out on a date. She became my first girlfriend. Now I'm happily married (to a different woman, though). Good luck, OP.
Single Men: How fast do you catch feelings?	With all the drama I went trough regarding women and it not even being my own fault either, I really have a hard time trusting women to start with. So in my case she really will need to try hard to even get any further then simply 'noticing' her. I would like to trust a woman, but so far no woman got near any level of trust that was needed to win me over. All thanks to some rotten apples that thought it would be excellent to ruin my life and figure out later that they made a horrible mistake. And yes, I did have a lot return to me begging me to take them in my life after what they did to me.	I’ve been speaking to a girl for 2 weeks, gone on one date. Already planning our marriage lol what’s wrong with me. Caught feelings pretty bad
What are some fucked up things you've seen someone praised for?	I peed in a guy's dryer once at a party. Made a girl cry because I started calling her "Jugs" instead of learning her name. I've been a dick to make girls break up with me. Myself and several others worked together and over time took thousands of dollars from my job when I was 18. Drank so much my legs stopped working. Drank so much I passed out on the kitchen floor. A friend called me to pick her up from the bar because another friend wouldn't stop hitting on her. She said she'd fuck me if I did. I did. She had a bf.	When me and my brother were around 7(?) we lived in an apartment complex and had gotten bikes for Xmas. We were out riding and at one point gone inside for a minute leaving our bikes out front. Go back out and my brothers bike is gone. We knew who it was as there was this one shit kid always pulling crap. Go over to his apartment and both he and his mother answer the door and we say that he took our bike. His fucking mother looked to us, said it was his bike, looked to him and congratulated him on "His new bike." Needless to say, my father went over and immediately got my brothers' bike back .
What's one aspect of dating men and women, respectively, fail to understand or come to terms with?	It's tough both ways. Men have to deal with the problems that come from approaching and projecting an attractive, confident personality and dealing with inevitable rejection. Women have the problem of trying to filter the men who *do* approach them for one who can handle her particular brand of crazy and/or bullshit. As much as it sucks sometimes to be the one who has to put his ego on the line, I'd hate it even *more* if the only way I had to filter was to choose from the ones who approached me.	sometimes things just don't click. you're not a bad person, they're not a bad person. it just didn't work and that's ok.
What was your worst "my SO can never know about this" story that didn't involve any sort of infidelity?	I dropped off university. I smoke, a lot more than she thought. I think her sister has sexy boobs & also, amazing 1 of a kind tits. Edit: PS: I know I have friends surfing reddit and she doesn't. Remember the brocodes, motherfuckers. I trust you.	My dog destroyed a pair of shoes she left at mine, so I threw them away. I get a call... "Did I leave my shoes at yours?" "Nah I've looked everywhere, can't find them." Wouldn't even be a big issue if the truth came out, she loves my dog, but I've got my boy's back & I'm in way too deep.
How do you deal with people flirting with your SO?	So Master_Nemo, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you were raised by a woman(like I was, single mom) or are part of the millennial generation. Either way let me make this easy for you, your "Mutual Acquaintance " was directly challenging your manhood and your dominance in your relationship with your SO. Make no mistake about it. Your words "he only did this when he thought I was too far away to hear". This isn't a problem with your woman, it's a problem with you failing to assert your dominance towards the other male. You need to learn when to "have a pair" and stand up for what's yours!	Well I trust my girlfriend to actually shut it down and not go along with it. Talk to her and tell her that it bothers you just like it bothers her when girls flirt with you
What is the most hurtful thing your SO could say to you without realizing it?	"I like you because of your personality, not because you are a man." That one right there makes me sick. Never had an SO, but if this happened I would be upright offended for the first time in my life. Why would anyone want to be with me if they didn't like my body or my gender? I sure as hell hope that this never happends.	Held a woman in my arms while she died one time. Two weeks later we were with some friends and they were asking about it. As i was telling them about it my ex said "Don't leave out the part where you cried like a little bitch." I left her very shortly after.
Do the women you date seem to have a lot of problems?	> mountain of problems, whether it's severe medical issues, crippling self-image issues, fractured family relations, constant anxiety attacks, a history of sexual abuse, drug or alcohol problems, or any combination of the above. Most of that in my experience is made up bullshit, being a victim in the west these days is cool and easy, but really being a westerner and woman especially is easy mode.	You are the x factor. People with the kinds of problems you are describing have often lost the patience and sympathy of friends and family. They are quickly attracted to people that will listen to their problems, whether romantic or no. As a patient, good listener, these women are finding you. Were you a woman, guys like this would be finding you. You are catnip to folks that like to create and obsess over problems. You don't have to be rude or change who you are, but you should find ways to challenge people in conversations and make it clear you are not quick to believe the exact story you are hearing. This lowers your value to folks like this while keeping you just as nice and friendly to normal folks that think it's fair to be challenged.
When I'm around my gay friends, I tend to "act a bit gay". Does anybody else do this? Gay men, does this happen/offend you?	Are you sure you just aren't a bit gay and that's why you act a bit gay? I think it's normal to pick up some of the attitudes of the people you hang out with, if they are gregarious or whatever, but changing your attitudes about being sexually open and acting more flamboyant is a little extreme.	I can't speak from experience for this specific example, but I do know that "mirroring" people you know pretty well when you are around them (picking up their mannerisms and sayings) is pretty common.
Men of reddit, what would be the best way for a girlfriend to express her concerns about the weight her boyfriend has gained? Is there a way to do this without crushing his self esteem?	You've gotten really terrible advice in this thread. He knows he's gained weight. He knows it isn't healthy. He doesn't want to be preached at, belittled, or bribed with sex. Lead by example... make him part of the process "I heard about this place __________ where there's a beautiful hike to a waterfall (or whatever). I thought we could go for a hike together on Saturday-- want to go?". Keep him active-- then, as you see he's losing weight, tell him how hot he looks, etc.	My girlfriend just straight up told me she thinks I've been gaining weight and what can we do about it. It hurt a bit but I'm no fool I noticed I was gaining weight. I appreciated her honesty
What's something non-sexual you only do in private?	Say random things, like nonsensical statements. Singing completely off key, that too usually not real songs just shit from my mind. Crying but not sobbing like a bitch or the emotional tears in the eyes but this weird half sob that I do to just get a feeling out of my system. Stank face and fist pump when something good happens.	Sometimes when I am really really down, I watch that 3 minute end of the one Simpsons episode where Homer went back to his hated job as Marge qas pregnant with Maggie, and he was punished with the demotivational plaque (Don't forget, you're here forever) and he later used Maggies pictures to cover it in a way that it reads Do it for her. And cry for 10 minutes. Then the world is a better place.
A male-only barber-shop as a "men's space"—what do you think of this idea?	Ever walk into a salon? A place where women go every month to have their hair colored and cut and whatever the fuck other voodoo they do? I dare you to walk in with a pair of balls and ask for a quick high and tight. I fuckin dare you. It's simultaneously hilarious and depressing that we have run out of actual problems in this society, to the point where we have to argue about whether the guys going to the barber shop is "socially acceptable." Ugh.	I don't see anything wrong with it. He's got an idea for his personal business and it's his right to see it through. and It's always a blessing finding places with a lot of experience cutting mens' hair
What's the silliest thing your SO has gotten mad at you for?	well, I once got mad at my bf because he didn't let me do a full makeup face on him. I just wanted to see how he would look like with makeup on and he didn't even let me put on lipstick! It was like he didn't wanted to make this little sacrifice for me Asshole	Ex wife would get mad at me for working out without her. If she didn't feel like going to the gym, or getting out of bed early to go run when it's cool outside, she would be upset if I did it without her. Basically she couldn't stand me improving myself if she wasn't too, like she was falling behind or something. She was a huge narcissist.
What's something you wished you could have done during your teenage years?	I wanted to do gymnastics when I was a kid (I wanna be a ninja yo!) but my dad thought it was too gay. What's gay about getting jacked and hanging out with mostly chicks? Idk. Reading your context though this probably doesn't help you. Just do anything you want man, you should be making the most out of *all* your weeks.	Gotten in shape. I was obese until I was 21-22, and it really sucked. You spend your entire childhood learning unhealthy habits, and it takes years of being nearly perfect in your habits to reverse it, and everyone treats you like a lazy piece of shit even when you're making progress because you're STILL fat after losing 50 pounds or more, and it really just sucks. People who had healthy households that promoted exercise and healthy eating instead of "no sports they're dangerous!" and goddamn fast food 3-4 nights a week because of one picky eater in the whole family are mostly fit because of circumstances surrounding their upbringing. Once you're a few years out of living at home you don't have much of an excuse but getting to college and having to make those changes was hard.
What made you think your SO was not the one for you?	She didn't suck my dick or let me put it in the ass. Who can stay with somebody like that for a lifetime? Fuck that shit	I guess the day I discovered she had cheated on me with one of my best friends was a pretty good eye opener
What are your personal dating double standards?	I have had sex with about 25 women; she better not have a partner count in the double digits. > It's ok for you to not shave your legs, But you would prefer your partner to be shaved. I don't know if that really counts as a double standard. Men don't usually shave their legs, because... well, they're men. Women are not men. It's not a personal decision as much as a cultural phenomenon, a societal expectation. It's like how it's almost expected of women to shave their armpits, but not of men: it's not an individual double standard. A better comparison would be male vs. female pubic hair, I think. But I'm really nit-picking here.	I'm allowed to worry about my SO about anything cause I'm caring and shit, yet she's can't worry about me. That's like my big double standard, but it doesn't just go for my SO but for everyone. I'm never ok when someone worries about me, I don't know why.
What is something every woman should know about her boyfriend?	A Man need quiet time and not be bothered unless for sex, food, beer... you get the idea. She should know that he needs time to spend with his bros without being bombarded with “when you coming? When you coming home?” She should know NOT to nag, nag, nag. She should know how to be direct when she wants something. Giving hints and clues only confuses a man. If you want sex from him, just say I’m honey, let’s fuck. If you want a specific present for your birthday, anniversary, etc, tell him “this is _______ (fill in what you want) for my birthday or anniversary. When going out to eat, don’t pick food from my plate. Order your own. More of a wish list for me.	Something he would like when stressed after a long day. My girlfriend will see my overwhelmed face when I get home sometimes, grab an Easy Mac from a hidden cabinet somewhere, and let me just zone out on the couch silently for a while. It's the greatest. Somehow we pass as adults.
I'm a woman moving into a house with five other guys. What can I expect and what should I/shouldn't I do?	Don't flush your tampons, it can clog the toilet. Wrap it in tp and put it in the trash can. Don't walk around in your underwear. They will expect you to cook and clean, make sure the responsibilities are shared for everyone. The house will stink. There will probably be random sloots getting railed at different times of the day and night. If a door is closed and it's extremely quiet or there's music playing, come back later and don't shake their hands. Make sure they have a vague idea when it's shark week, it will probably be the most peaceful week of the month.	ALWAYS KNOCK. SOFTLY. There's no need to pound. You don't want to walk in on one beating it. You also don't want to give him a heart attack and manhandle his dick when he flinches from random pounding on the door. Source: both have happened to me.
What do you wish you did/knew while in high school?	I wish I had discovered drugs sooner, instead of buying into all the DARE crap. I wish I had taken school more seriously and tried to nab a scholarship to a college. I wish I knew which friends weren't my friends at all. And I really wish I didn't care about seeking approval from so many people who looked down on me. I coulda been a lot happier!	How to not be afraid of rejection. Everyone has that one person they miss not asking. I had, and kinda still, a gigantic crush on this girl. I wish I had gone for it.
Attractive men who used to be considered ugly: What were your thoughts when women started checking you out rather than look at you in disgust?	Greying hair. Actually, no, I've always been considered *somewhat* attractive - it's just that being older has become something of a magnet.	I had low self esteem, and I magnified my flaws to such an extreme that I thought myself ugly. When a girl looked at me, I thought they were looking at me in disgust. Sometimes, when they saw that they noticed them looking at me, they would giggle. I thought they were mocking at me, and they probably were many times because I was not smooth at all. The word, "dork", comes to mind. During my late teens, girls really started paying attention to me. There was one girl in particular who really made me aware how "not" ugly I was. That girl, who wasn't the mocking type, that's the person who made me realize, "hey, maybe I'm not ugly at all."
What are the actual steps that happen between meeting someone and having casual sex?	Don't talk to her like a friend from the beggining be charming Funny confident tease tease her If you want sex you have to portray that in yourself Think how girls make themselves look sexy You have to do the male version of that You attract what you put out always If you want sex make it obvious you don't want anything else If you want it to be casual then you can't let emotions feelings life troubles get into your head you have to be confident trustworthy etc Make yourself into a guy girls want to bang	> what's the "one-thing-led-to-another" part? Both parties send signals, one of them escalates things with physical contact like touching a hand or leg and then, if the other party doesn't reject that offer, moves on to kissing and eventually foreplay. Sometimes things can be kind of blurry even after all that in which case I'll ask how far she wants to take things. I'd assume that movies and pop culture tend to skip these steps because showing an hour of flirting, making out and touching would be boring.
What do you do when your roomate brings a girl in his room?	Fuck no you arent supposed to leave. You two cohabit the same space. If he wasnt nice enough to give you a heads up, or even ask if you wouldnt mind dipping out, then fuck him. Stay right wherever it is you want to stay.	You're supposed to coordinate with your roommates about getting the room alone if one is looking to bang. At least if you share the same bedroom. If you have separate bedrooms, just leave 'em alone in his bedroom.
Men of Reddit, I am a lady about to confess romantic feelings to one of my best male friends. I am 50/50 on if they are reciprocated. Any advice on how to make this as easy on him/least awkward for him as possible - no matter what his response may be?	This is going to sound unorthodox, but trust me... get a couple of your best girlfriends, get all dolled up, your prettiest dress, go to a nice wine bar, drink till last call, take an Uber to his house, drunken love confession, sleep with him. I give it more like 90/10 odds.	"I'd like to take you on a date" is pretty good. It's an open offer, it's easy to refuse not-to-awkwardly, and doesn't scream "I want your cock" from the get go.
What false paradigms of life did you buy into ?	That high school is the least important part of your life. Turns out it's one of the *most.* Not in any sort of 'get good marks, go to university' sense (though that's important) but the more I'm around, the more I realize that life in any work-place is basically a mirror of high school, with nicer suits. There's the same back-stabbing, the same gossip, the same smile-to-your-face stab-the-back mentality, the pretty girls/boys get special privileges. And the politicking is the *worst* because it's the *single most important thing* about getting ahead in your career: shmoozing > talent 99% of the time. The aphorism "It's not *what* you know it's *who* you know" is the single most important thing about your career. Makes me wish I were a good, slimy social climber.	If you work hard, be honest, and develop your skills, you will be rewarded, treated fairly, and appreciated by your superiors at work. Conversely, those who are lazy, dishonest, and lack skills will not be rewarded at work. Fortunately, it only took me about one year of corporate life to figure that out that was complete BS, and therefore I was able to survive in such life until I could escape.
Guys, if you were with a girl who genuinely enjoyed anal sex, how often would you prefer to have anal rather than vaginal sex?	I'm not into the idea of anal, but I'm also not really against it, so I guess that would depend on how often the girl asked for it. Then again, I'm very much a sub, so this question doesn't really apply much to me.	Let me start by saying anal is my favorite. It's tight, it's a good hard orgasm for her almost every time, it's really my favorite. HOWEVER, it's my favorite because it's not every time. I play with her ass a little every time, but full on anal is not every time, and that's part of what makes it my favorite. She'll give me head or vaginal sex pretty much whenever I want it, within reason.....but anal.....anal is when I know she's really into the fuck, and wants to have a good hard orgasm. My answer is that if she WANTED anal all the time, by gosh she'd have anal. It's the bomb.
Dear Redditors, could you help me understand why men find my past weird?	> I went through high school thinking dating was really dumb (which it was at that age) and wasn't open to it. > In my first few years of university, I didn't meet anyone worthwhile, Frankly, you come off as egotistical, and pretentious, which *is* weird. Good for you for knowing what you want and being serious, but don't expect every candidate *you* find up to snuff to think along the same lines you do. Also, since you haven't dated, there's a good chance you only have a superficial idea of what you want, which means the prospective relationship is already off to a rocky start from his eyes. EDIT: Format	It's unusual and thus weird, but there's nothing wrong with that. You know what you want and what you don't want. That's fine. At the same time, you probably shouldn't just assume guys your age are only looking for hookups. I'm sure there are plenty of guys your age that are looking for long term relationships. I was when I was 20.
What do you think is the biggest lie that men tell themselves?	That getting married is a good idea. It's not - cohabitating with a woman is a very bad deal for men emotionally and financially. You will lose half of everything you own and will be limited access to your own children while your ex tries to turn them against you. Look around at all the men you know and you'll see how common that is.	"I'm fine, I don't need help," for anything in their head Or "This is normal, I don't need a doctor," for physical health issues
How do you deal with your gf spending a lot of time with another guy?	Drop her. You always want to keep the women in your life around on your terms. You're clearly not happy with this so end it.	Alot of guys are saying to find a girl to hang out with. This will just cause more issues and am eventual break up. Might as well just break up with her in the first place and avoid stupid drama. You can't do much except work on your relationship if you want to keep her. She will do what she will do. Either you have trust in her and work on this with your relationship or move on and break up.
Its usually guys doing things to impress women; what's something a woman has done that has impressed you?	Not much, but I don't mind, women are not conditioned to try to impress men. Women pursue impressive things for their own enrichment.	Had a tough time at uni a few years ago during exams and told the girl I liked at the time (who’d just finished a paper herself) about it. A few hours later, I get a phone call from her asking me to come downstairs (she lived in another apartment building a 10-minute walk away from me). I meet her downstairs and she gives me a box of brownies she’d baked which she brought over just to cheer me up. We never had a relationship, but I’m always gonna remember that gesture for the rest of my life as one of the sweetest things anyone’s ever done for me, in more ways than one.
Does the "social media" boyfriend actually exist?	Yes, OP. People do occasionally do nice things for their girlfriends. You're getting a lot of weird answers here, but this subreddit seems to be filled with CHUDS.	I was drunk on my way home on Friday night and order my wife a pizza. Is that close enough
Former Nice Guys™, what incident finally snapped you out of it?	When I found out I was tired of getting stepped on. I didn't stop being nice I just started to get what I wanted and I was happier.	I guess the girl I was into stopped paying me any attention, so I just said fuck it and did what I wanted. It hasn't had much success overall, but I'm not being a dumb ass, so that's good enough.
Do you guys have a bed frame?	It makes me wonder what the rest of your place looks like. It also makes me wonder what your life is like. You probably need to expand your Horizons. There is more to life than what your routine is currently. Learn to appreciate furniture, cooking, camping, something else...before it passes you by. You might want these things later in life and realize the time has gone. You are 26, you're older than you think. Good luck, and change up your stuff.	Trashy is a little much but it is an incomplete setup. It screams bachelor but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.
What is the dumbest thing you have ever said or asked?	Idk but yall motherfuckers need to learn how to let shit go. We have awkward interactions from time to time. We stumble over our words every so often. We make fools of ourselves now and again. Shake it off. No wonder there are so many sad sacks in the world	Extremely good looking cart girl on the golf course on a very hot day. She makes a comment about the weather. My attempt at flirting. "Are ya sweatin" she just looked at me like I must be special needs. Many years ago and I still cringe whenever I think about it.
How have askmen helped you?	It's made me feel better about myself compared to all of the whiny, sexist, virgin guys on here who do nothing but whine about how much their lives suck.	I came to this sub from a therapist who suggested that hearing more male voices might help me recover from an assault. You guys are amazing and you have helped me a lot.
Hey, how has your opinion of dating/sex changed over the years?	Younger: best thing about sex = me cumming Older: best thing about sex = making her cum multiple times then asking her about it	Well, in general ideas, I place a much greater emphasis on making sure that someone qualifies as a potential partner. I encourage people not to overlook things they can't deal with, and not to go back to on-again, off-again relationships. If someone's broken up with you once, that shouldn't be someone you want to date.
What is the most ‘wtf’ thing you’ve done out of horniness?	If I gotta shoot one off I do. I take my time away to clear my mind. Of course I'd rather be balls deep in some wet pussy but this'll have to do.	I just remembered the girl at my high school who got caught with a test tube up her vagina in the science labs during lunch time. I hope she’s doing well.
What is the dumbest/most embarrassing/most cringeworthy thing you've done for someone you liked?	I have wrote a long "I like you" letter in my cellphone when we both were in a bar... She read it, then kissed me and said "but I just don't want any rings on me" I just paralized, started to laught and hugged her... Then never touched in the subject again... Until now I just can't compreend WTF did i made in that day...	I was still in my teens. And in a foolish moment of drunken lust, I emailed a cringeworthy "confession" of my feelings to my crush, who was also a student coworker. I threw in every corny cliche I knew, including something about us walking along beaches together. She never responded, at least not directly to me. Instead she wrote an opinion column in the campus newspaper that appeared two days later, taking to task how people who annoyingly gush out confessions of their affection over email. I wasn't named at least, but my email was extensively quoted.
Men, how do you feel about women approaching you at the gym?	When I'm at the gym I'm there to work out and blow off steam. Leave me alone, at least until I'm done.	More than happy for a girl to approach me, however, I do feel creepy approaching a girl in the gym
What is a fetish that you recommend others try?	r/hematolagnia That is all. PSA: It's not for everyone. ---- Wow, bunch of judgmental people in here. Nothing wrong with it between two consenting adults.	Hate fucking, like where you talk shit to eachother and fight while fucking. I dont know why but i find it strangely awesome when a girl keeps telling me that im an asshole and that i dont deserve this while sucking my cock.
Men of Reddit who have been falsely accused of rape. How did you handle it and what was the outcome?	I'm gonna double down with the first guy, deny deny deny. A false rape accusation if it goes far enough can ruin your life. Also stop fucking people that are one person away from your co worker. If she hates you so much that she is trying to get people to file a fucking rape report then she's very clearly a fucked up bitch. To be honest I would find a new job too. I would also key that bitches car and slash her tires. That's me though. What the fuck did you do to that feminist to get her to hate you so much? I know feminists hate penis but Jesus dude.	My coworker accused me of rape. There was an internal investigation done by the company and they determined that it was consensual and she was lying (she had told another coworker of ours specifically that it was consensual). That wasn't the end of it though, shortly after the police contacted me wanting to ask me some questions, I cooperated and answered their questions and took a polygraph. Later that day the detective in charge said he had come to the same conclusion the company had and that she was lying. I was off the hook criminally but out of a job since they decided to fire us both anyways. I don't know if she was charged with falsifying a police report or anything. Fucked me up for quite some time, I couldn't understand why someone would so ruthlessly try and ruin my life.
Do you ever kiss a FWB outside of sex?	No. I held pretty firm boundaries with my old fwb because I got burned by blurring them by things like this before. IMO, I think you should focus more on the sex. No hanging out outside of sex. No Facebook friendship. No texting outside of setting up meets or sexting/flirting. No kissing outside of sex. Even minimal cuddling. I know it sounds cold, but it worked out great.	This is somewhat related. I used to be a porn producer. Every performer, contract or not, had a list of things they would do or didn't do. Most of it was extreme things like scat, watersports, large objects, etc. But kissing was actually pretty common as well. The performers (men and women, in gay or straight porn) felt that kissing was more intimate than the sex itself, so if they had an SO at the time, the kissing would be reserved for them. Sometimes the girls would just do girl-girl if they were in a relationship, but most of the time it was kissing that became the special act between them and the person they loved.
Why do girls treat guys better if he is with another girl?	My wife says that women are naturally "catty" with other women, so when there is a male involved they use him as a "buffer" to play the situation out till both women are comfortable with eachother.	Pre-selection. The fact that you've been "accepted" (they don't know she's your sister) by other women can make a woman see you in a better light. Many married men can tell you how their ring can get many women going, and it's not because of some specific will to break up a relationship. Men with ample options with women, men with success with women, even men who just give off the vibe of success, they're simply the ones who'll be particularly attractive to other women. Extra edit: this isn't only sexual, either.
What's the dumbest thing you've ever done because of your crush?	I blushed when she was talking to me, with several of our mutual friends watching. We were 21/22. No one pointed it out but I doubt they didn't notice. Talk about looking like a needy/clingy wimp.	Well I dont have any stories myself, but the awkward rich kids at my school asked out this hot popular girl by giving her a diamond necklace. Turned him down and still kept the necklace.
My girlfriend recently died in an accident, how do I get past it?	Please take this off and do not ask Reddit for advice with this, for your own good. Seek professional help.	See a professional therapist or grief counselor. A forum such as this is in no way capable of giving you the kind of help you need right now.
What is the dumbest way you've accidentally hurt your own balls?	I was playing with a 10-gallon bucket in the shower. The bucket had a rope handle. I held the handle as high as I could while water flowed into the bucket. The bucket became to heavy and the rope was unable to support the weight. The nearly full bucket fell down on to my balls and the lip of the bucket cut my dick. I then put a band-aid on my dick boo-boo and after I applied the band-aid I realized taking the band-aid off would hurt a lot and it did. Needless to say, all three incidents hurt a lot.	I was really drunk and thought it would be funny to run, grab onto a light pole, and swing around using my leg. I was nearly blackout drunk and don't actually know how to do that... so I just basically ran at the pole and jumped at it crotch first. Bad times... bad times.
I don't trust her anymore... how to let her down easy?	You couldn't even be bothered to give your fiance a call to break up with her? Did you really do it over fucking FB messenger? Really?	> Not posting this on /r/relationships[1] because let's face it - /r/relationships[2] is shit, and also I'm banned from there. lol "and also I'm banned from there." it is shit though.
30+ year olds without female experience, how did it happen?	Bookmarking just to see this show. If it happens that is, don't think you're gonna see a lot of guys 30+ speaking up about never getting their dick wet. Why are you scared to hit the 4th base OP?	I was obese most of my life. I had friends up until high school, but a cross-country move and developing depression (undiagnosed at the time) at 15 took care of that. Went untreated for 15 years. Ballooned up to ~450 lbs. Lost a lot of weight starting about 5 years ago (down to 210). But that's also when I realized I had more issues than just the obesity. I started therapy this year, but things have been going slowly. Now I'm caught in a catch 22. Loneliness really is the biggest driver of my worst depressive moods. But nobody wants to be around someone that's lonely or depressed. Which only makes me more lonely and depressed.
Guys who thought with their dick and it backfired - what happened?	Slept with my ex once. She proceeded to text me all the time for a couple weeks. Ghosted the fuck out of her.	The hot girl im my group of friends called me one night saying she needed a place to crash i being single and hoping to bang her said ok. 20 minutes after she arrived her crazy ex pulled up with a baseball bat. It went about how you would expect. I pulled my gun he dropped the bat and ran abandoning his car neighbors called the cops before I could. They pulled up as I was dialing 911. She told them I pulled a gun on him for no reason luckily i had set up cctv cameras the year before. I showed the cops the tape they asked if i wanted him charged which i declined. I threw her out of the house and lost a group of friends.
Do guys keep nudes of their exes?	I can't imagine why it would be difficult for a girl to understand why a guy might want to keep pictures of beautiful naked girls.	I don't keep them in a special nude box but I don't delete them when I'm backing up all my pictures on my external hard drive. This might seem weird but I kind of want to keep everything, even the very personal stuff, for when I'll be older. I like the idea of having this "folder/box of personal history" that I'll look someday remembering the days of when I was young.
Why do you think it is it mostly guys wanting to be rated?	Because any woman who is a 3-4+ is constantly showered with attention and compliments on social media and in real life. Why would she have to post to a sub like that? She already thinks she's a 10.	Because men are consistently not given any indication of their attractiveness in the real world (compliments from women, women approaching men for dates, etc.).
Why do I keep falling for female friends?	It makes sense. A good relationship is one where you're friends and lovers. I don't think men and women are really meant to be, or capable of, being "just friends".	Have you ever been in a romantic relationship with a woman you loved? Because from what you say it seems like you're mistaking the love and bond friends share for romantic feelings and love a couple would share. It's two different types of companionship. I would recommend to you if you are interested in dating is to go find women who you are not friends with and take the time to date them and get to know them. You say you have never been attracted to someone you didn't know well, so take the time to get to know some girls. Start dating.
How common is it for young men to get sexually assaulted/groped by older women?	"Every" man has dealt with this at some point in his life just like "every" woman has. The difference is we don't make a big fucking deal about it.	Probably more common than you'd think. Many older women (in my experience) will do things that would be considered sexual harassment if the genders were reversed once they get drunk, but it's just considered something you have to deal with. I've been lucky enough to only have had to deal with older drunk women who were *very aggressively flirting*, they never quite started touching me, probably because of the big fluorescent STAFF vest though
Fellow men, how do YOU handle the "nothing" phone call?	I too have noticed this tendency of women to call you up and discuss nothing. My wife does it to me all the time - usually she picks the most inconvenient time to call - a time when she knows that I'll be in the middle of cooking dinner. Sigh..... It's an annoying tendency many women have - but it is harmless and, if it makes them feel better, then why not engage them. Women and men are different, and its better that we try to accommodate those differences.	1. ask her any question 2. ask a question about her answer 3. relate 4. repeat eg, 1. Do you like bacon? 2. Why not? 3. yeah, I hear you. It is sad to see the pictures of pigs in tiny cages that the PETA volunteers pass out downtown by Frank's Bar. 4. Ever go to Frank's Bar? The structure will quickly dissolve because you'll have hit on some common interest and you'll be asking questions and relating anecdotes because you are actually interested and engaged in the subject. Bonus round: when you relate, make a joke or witty observation or gently poke fun at her, get her laughing. Expert mode: make those jokes flirtatious. Sprinkle in very light innuendo.
It’s often said that when men wear a wedding ring they get more attention from women. Do you think they are actually flirting or perhaps they now consider you “safe” and can be friendly/friends without worrying about being hit on themselves?	Whenever im single girls barely come. Whenever i get a girl multiple hot girls r into me. Must be a test. Maybe she setting me up ?? Hahaha	As a young married dude it’s both, being married (generally) makes you feel much safer so they can let their guard down more and also makes you seem more desirable. Also, personally, I am way more confident when talking to women since getting married because there’s not the same pressure/need to impress.
Men, what are you looking forward to the most about becoming a dad one day? And if you don't, why not?	Don't. 55+, haven't made it so far as cohabitating yet. Planet is also more than sufficiently crowded. Certainly also don't want to be dealing with diapers, ... nor having 18+ years of my remaining life sucked up with being obligated to raise a kid. I also don't think raising a teenager is my idea of how to be starting my retirement. And too, kids should't be having parent(s) at high school graduation that are older than most parents ... that's just quite messed up - not to mention they'd also get to have a lot fewer years of their parent(s) even being alive. Oh, yeah, becoming a dad would also mean something went significantly wrong with the vasectomy and the test results after.	I've always wanted a daughter, but as years go on, I feel the urge getting weaker and weaker. I feel like that if I was a father, I'd be a "full-time dad". I'd live, breath and die for my child. I'm not sure I'm willing to become *so* selfless anymore... Maybe one day. My mind is set on having it a lot later, though, preferably in my 40's. And only one child, regardless of sex. I wanna make sure that, at least, I have the experience, money and time to care for them, 'til I'm either dead or they don't need me anymore. I'll be 26 in april, if that matters.
Men who were thrown back into the dating pool with zero tinder/online dating experience: how's it going?	Stop trying to "get" women. Not worth it. Save your time and money. Spend your time doing things you like and spending your money on yourself. If you want sex, hire a prostitute or take a "Sexcation". As someone who raised a family (including step-children), I consider my last 30 years of life wasted and if I could have it back, I wouldn't do it again. Have a "relationship" is just a sounds-nice way of women getting men to "provide" for them while giving little to nothing of value in return. Skip it!	I spent like 6 months tindering. This is what I learned. Super likes have a MUCH higher success rate, I would swipe until I deemed someone super like worthy then stop swiping. If you drop your standards a bit you'll have more success. Obvious but true. A match doesn't actually mean shit. Understandable considering going on a date with someone you just met on a dating app is totally different to swiping right. For every 1000 guys like you on Tinder there's 1 girl. Good luck with that. Tinder will take your self esteem into the alley outside and shoot it. Tinder is a waste of time.
Men who simply don't enjoy watching wildlife documentaries, why? Ever feel like you're missing out?	No but sometimes I think there's something wrong with me when my interests differ wildly from what other people my age / gender / race are into	I'm one of those guys. I see wildlife documentaries as a bunch of animals who I don't know living a life that doesn't affect me. I really have no reason to get emotionally invested. I imagine you'd get the same feeling about watching something like a South Korean muskrat ping pong tournament.
Men of Reddit, what's bothering you?	My SO [F/19] has strict and conservative parents. I want that to change so we don't have to keep hiding.	My SO argues about everything to get her way, and I'm annoyed that I'm going to have to fight back over stupid shit so that I can have a say about anything.
Guys who have been single for a long time (3+years) how has it affected your psyche?	It hasn't why would it? I've never got why some people need to be in a relationship. What's wrong with being happy with your own company and socialising with friends. I've never felt they need to actively go and seek out relationships if i meet someone who i get on really well with i'll ask her out but i don't actively search for such a thing.	I spent all of college and grad school single, then from 26-30. It just made me more secure in myself, comfortable being single, and unwilling to compromise myself for a relationship.
What's the most fucked up thing you have done to a woman and do you regret it?	Posted her nudes online, shared them with everyone she new, fucked up her "relationships" by warning her other boyfriends who then broke up with her. Why? Cause she was the biggest cunt you can imagine, was dating like 5 guys at once. Posted the nudes after she tried to break up my new relationship by shittalking me to my new GF who luckily didn't care. Only thing I regret is dating her.	In university a couple girls in my class approached me and insisted that I go out with their friend who I'd sat next to once or twice and nothing else. I gave her a look and she was pretty enough so I said to them, "sure, we'll hang out over the summer." I had forgotten that I had a flight that evening and was spending the summer with my family in France. I completely forgot she even existed until I saw her again in a lecture and thought, "Oh Neptune."
(UPDATE) How to tell boyfriend I have cancer?	I completely understand that he's upset, but he needs to have a better stress response than punching things. edit: disagree and downvote me all you want. I don't care. I've been in my share of stressful situations (though not this specifically, yet) and punched my share of inanimate objects. It doesn't help, and thankfully he didn't injure himself. Lashing out with violence doesn't solve anything, and can only make a stressful situation worse.	Please, give us an update every once in a while about your treatment! All the best towards this. life is tough, so are you. *Internet hug from a random stranger*
What's pissing you off right now?	Just.....the sheer willful ignorance, and the sheer numbers, of people on the radical left. I know I should just ignore it, but dear tittyfucking Christ, the atrocities against logic rile me. And it’s depressing as fuck. How can we ever have any cultural harmony in this country again, when so many people stick their fingers in their ears and scream when presented with an opposing viewpoint?! And don’t get me started on the self-righteousness. I just mourn for our culture. And, since I’ve committed the heresy of being an open conservative on Reddit, come at me with those downvotes.	Thanks for this, I been looking for an excuse to vent. My goddamn friends haven't hung out with me in two months, including my birthday. They hang out with all their other friends, but they can't be bothered to either invite me along or to accept when I ask them to do stuff. So... at this point... fuck em. I deserve better.
What do you find unattractive what most others find attractive in women?	Fat asses. I like a nicely proportioned ass but if it's droopy and cellulite-y, I'm not a fan. Also big boobs. There's a point where they start to get gross.	Whatever you call the aesthetic that Kylie Jenner sets as the modern "standard". I hate caked makeup, gigantic lips, and whatever else is a component of that look. EDIT: Holy smokes, this blew up! Good to know other people feel the same way!
Do you talk about other women while in a relationship?	I also think talking like that is crude, disrespectful, and breeds idolization outside of your relationship which IMHO is unhealthy. ***But*** I have always felt like a statistical outlier in this regard as I know many, many other men who do. For reference I'm a 27M in a 3+ year relationship. I will tell my SO if I think a female is attractive but the thought of banging anyone else is repulsive.	Its crude, but what men are really saying is: *I find her attractive enough, that if my circumstances were different, and she agreed, we would proceed to a physical relationship*
How can I talk to my boyfriend about lasting longer? NSFW?	Don't blame my dude. Sometimes the pussy be so wet that a nigga can't help but skeet. One time I met this pregnant latina at Walmart. Bruh I swear I nutted after 47 seconds.	There is only one sure way I've found to deal with it. Be a two pump chump for round 1, then a bucking stallion for round 2
What is something in men's fashion you absolutely hate and refuse to wear?	any kind of sandals/flip flops beards dress pants and dress shoes with no socks tucked in shirt with a belt cinched too tight, you look like sausage and it makes you look fatter than you are anything that doesn't fit right (baggy pants, skinny jeans, XX shirts when you should be wearing a medium etc)	Most things with a logo. If it's unavoidable (like with athletic wear), it's going to be minimal. Anything that's supposed to be funny. Every time you wear that 'hilarious' t-shirt, I feel like you're just repeating the same joke.
We often hear of women's experiences with men in the workplace.Men of Reddit, what have been your experiences (good or bad) with women in the workplace?	99% of bad experiences I've had with female coworkers or bosses were bad because they were bad, not because of the gender of the person involved.	I'm pretty sure everyone at my job is way more politically correct and professional at work than they are in real life. It's to a point where I don't feel like I truly can get to know anyone. So there are no issues with anyone at my job.
Too many relationship posts on the front page. What's your favorite sandwich?	***The Ghetto Sandwich*** Is pretty simple. You're gonna take a polish sausage and slice it lengthwise. Almost in half but not fully. Throw it into a pan and cook it on both sides. Then smother that sunamuhbitch in onions, cheese, mustard, mayonnaise and ketchup in between slices of white bread. I'm also really partial to olives and tomato in a roll. Sometimes with roast beef or another deli meat.	I've got 2. Sandwich the first. Ciabatta bread. Lightly toasted. Thinly sliced red onion. Blue cheese dressing. Baby spinach. Medium rare strip steak sliced and salted. Sliced avocado. Dash of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. And then the other half of the bread. Sandwich the second. Turkish bread, lightly toasted. Garlic dressing. Rib eye steak. Red onion relish (red onions, garlic, balsamic, tomatoes, sugar). Salad. Swiss cheese. Other half of bread.
Do guys honestly notice nipples?	yeah, and i have preferences. in fact, I could probably describe a handful of women who are my physical idea of a wet dream. Bit it doesn't matter - If I like you well enough to want you naked, it isn't a big thing if your nips are different from what I would like. Sure, I'm shallow, not not _that_ shallow.	Unless they are REALLY weird, I wouldn't worry about it. Most boobs look pretty good. I know I said something to a GF when I was 17 that I regret to this day.
Skinny men - Does it bother you when people feel the need to point it out constantly? What do you do about it?	I had a random Haitian woman on the street ask if I was hungry. I stared awkwardly as I was just thrown off. I awkwardly grinned and said, "Oh no, I just had eaten". Then walked off feeling like I should really eat more.	It used to be annoying for me, I've just learned to shrug it off and not really respond, it is what it is. I know I'm healthy and am happy with myself so why bother?
What's your "one simple trick"?	When you don't hear what a person says the first time, say "I can't understand you when you mumble." They will immediately think you're an asshole. Unless you say it with a smile in which results may vary. I don't know what I was getting at but I just find this response hilarious and want more people to use it.	After a shower, squeegee yourself off with your hands before reaching for the towel. Kinda like wiper blades on a car. You dry off 90% quicker and the towel doesn't get soggy.
Men who make 100k+ a year, what do you do?	Majority of people in tech, consulting, finance, law, or STEM fields will earn over $100k. Many of them will even start at or very close to $100k right out of school. If you're struggling to hit $100k you're probably in the wrong field, in which case you need to think about whether it's worth studying again to try and change career paths. Some people are completely happy with less work, less stress, and less pay. Everything is a trade off.	Front end web development / analytics. When you know how to shape an online experience you can get people to do all sorts of things (mostly buying stuff).
What makes a woman trashy?	* Spreading rumors to give people bad rep. * Cursing * Piercings * Tatoos of any sort It's all about respect	A woman being "trashy" is much the same thing as a guy being a typical "douchebag" or "tool". Shitty clothes in the wrong situations. Obnoxious tattoos Over use of profanity Resorting to violence or the threat of it Just being a generally shitty person quite honestly.
What do you regret not doing in your youth?	I'm only 23 and just graduated from college but I was never good enough for women, I was only good enough to be their back up, get lead on, and used for attention. Some guys here regret the chances they didn't take, but still got and get chances. I was never really given a chance, I was the guy on the side while other guys were the ones getting chances with them and having the experiences I wanted with those girls.I can never go back and be good enough and I don't think I will ever move on from that, I don't think any woman will really live up to what I wanted either now.	Being myself. I was always trying to be someone else so I could have friends or have a girlfriend. Now that I am 40 I am who I want to be
How do you stop from being a "back seat driver" when your girlfriend is horrible at driving?	Put it all on you. She's not a bad driver. You're too nervous and controlling to be a passenger. Or just make it seem like you're offering to drive to be nice and help out.	As a person with a father who drives pretty much the same, I say do one or more of the following: A) Hold on for dear life and keep your teeth gritted. B) Show her (inconspicuously) videos and photos of people who get royally fucked while driving carelessly. C) Sit in the actual back seat. D) Don't give a shit about offending her and drive yourself. After all, is it a bigger deal to piss off your girlfriend, or to get killed because she disregards safety?
As a 5'3" man who feels insecure about my height, what do you do about that?	What do you \*do\*? I'm sure other commenters will give you the standard advice: work out, get swole, accept yourself, there's someone out there for everyone, etc. But here are two more extreme options... **Leg Lenthening:** Leg lengthing costs something like $50k, can get you between 2" and 3", and only takes a few months. These days you don't need pins sticking out of your legs. They just put a remote-controlled rod in your leg and extend it slowly over weeks. That'd put you closer to 5'6". Not tall, but, taller than many women. Weirdly, Las Vegas is where all the best clinics are for that. **Moving:** There are a lot of countries where 5'3" is not an unusual height for a man. Guatemala, Laos, the Philippines. Maybe just start a new life in another country. Edit: upped the cost after looking it up.	How old are you? I don't mean that in a malicious way because I'm 5'3 (or 2, not really sure) but at the age of 30, the last I heard about my height from others was in my early 20s, in a toxic workplace. Now I'm married and while I'm not well-off financially, I have a managerial role and I well respected in the company that I'm in. Believe me, my height got to me but things always come right if you believe they will...and I sure had hope that they did. But also what another person said, exercise! Working out did wonders for my self-esteem!
Shy guys, how do you feel when a girl suggest grabbing coffee with you?	¿Minimal contact girl (Conversations and interactions limited to the work place)? I don't drink coffee, but would say the same if she suggest water (or something between the lines: "Im not thirsty, but thanks) xd. ¿A friend or someone that i'm socially active with? Sure, why not. >has people asking her out every once a while ¿Why would that matter? xd	I tell them I don’t drink coffee. Then I spend the rest of the year calling myself an idiot cause what if the important part was spending time with me rather that the actual coffee??
My girlfriend is great and we're great togther, but why do I sometimes feel like I have a gut feeling we're not right for each other?	I usually follow my gut feeling. it has this amazing power of keeping me from bad things. Sometimes you can't do that without concrete reason, so you keep your gut feeling in mind until something bad happen and it rings a bell. why do you feel she's not right for you? when did you that feeling? if the only reason is because she's different than the girl you've always though you'd be with..let me tell you something no one ends up with the people they thought they would end up with.	Sometimes I feel the same way about my SO. Sometimes not. That's life. But after 40 years or so, I still can't think any woman who was a better fit for me. And I dated a ton of women. Have you ever met this imaginary woman who would be a better fit for you?
How much does a girl's friends affect your decision to date her?	female friends I could care less about. Its when a chick has too many dude friends I get turned off.	I don't particularly mind unless they have a friend who really sticks their nose in. I was on track to date this girl but her mate was all "this is my girl" and always checking up on us and shit. Dipped out of that one pretty quick.
My boyfriend is the greatest guy ever...so why am I feeling like this?	This is something I observe in many women and it's probably the main reason why I refuse to be in a relationship. You could be the perfect man, nourish the relationship, try to make your partner happy and one day find out all this effort was for nothing. Stability is the woman's worst enemy. Could it be that you don't feel the thrill? Would fights, breaking up and coming back together, relationship problems make you want him more? Because that seems to be the common denominator of most of the long lasting (and IMO, destructive and disfunctional) relationsips I know of.	This may not apply to you, but a hell of a lot of people throw away something good because it doesn't line up with some bullshit they have in their head of "the way a relationship should be." It's shouldn't *be* anything. Stop thinking about anything other than this one question: Does he make you happy?
Men of Reddit, if you were on a fourth date making out with a girl, and she tells you she experienced SA when she was younger, does this scare you off, or how do you react?	Maybe that's not the right time to tell people that you had an uncle bad-touch, homie. Try doing it when his dick isn't hard.	as someone who also had SA when i was younger, it would make me feel awesome if someone shared that with me. i still have major intimacy issues as well, and it would help me to feel understood and less judged. on that note, he maybe just doesn’t have the same experience and feels like he doesn’t understand your hang ups. imo, you did the right thing by telling him because it’s an important thing to know about you. i’m sorry to hear that he doesn’t seem to be accepting of that ):
Do any guys find it hard to cum from a blowjob?	First off, if they act like it's a chore or if they are doing me a favor then there's no way I'm coming. Also, a problem for me is that I last a good 10+ minutes and most women are too lazy to give head that long. If they have skills I can come faster, but they usually aren't very good at it. I will offer instruction if she's open to it, but some women are just better at this than others.	I do but only because there's not enough pressure from her mouth when she's not using her hand, once she gets the hand action in there then I'm good to go. I don't get a lot of them so my biggest problem aside from that is getting out of my own head.
I am not afraid of asking that girl out. I am afraid of having to put in the effort to develop a relationship with her. Does anybody else share this sentiment?	ITT: "I hate putting effort into something that has a low success/high return probability and feeling like I have to actually *prove myself worthy*. Why won't chicks come to meeee???"	Yes completely, Im not afraid of asking a girl out, I dont want to be some girls court jester: entertaining her, keeping conversation going, organizing everything, etc. I hate the feeling of constantly having to "prove" myself, its exhausting.
What are some general rules of thumb for cooking that every man should know? What are the meals you feel that every man should know how to cook?	This is more a personal rule, but I find if you're not sure, it's better to over cook than undercook.	Let you meat sit after cooking and before cutting. Baked Ziti is easy and lasts for days. You can sub ziti for almost any other pasta type and it makes a very slightly different dish.
Drinkers of AskMen -- What's your #1 sign that you've reached the point of being drunk?	When I know I can't walk unless I wait a little bit, I stop drinking. Usually that's 6 double tall crown and cokes in two hours, with 2 Redd's up front.	My "tell" is letting out a huge exhale with my lips pursed and cheeks puffed. I have no clue why I do this, and I do this without thinking when I get drunk; when I recognize it, it's my sign to slow down before I say stupid things like "moving around is fun!" in public again.
What's a little thing that your woman does that sends you over the edge during sex?	Usually when she cums she will start bucking her hips and wagging her tail. That with her vaginal contraction milking me for all its worth.	Her mouth, lips, and tongue- wanders around playfully when she's using them on me. It slays me. Her enthusiasm is terrible for my stamina but it makes my brain absolutely melt. Lastly, when she talks filthy and doesn't feel embarrassed or uncomfortable- super hot. When she wants me harder, deeper, or faster and vocalizes it- I'm usually a goner.
What's with the negative stigma around being uncircumcised in America?	>For clarity, I myself am not trying to campaign for anti-circumcision. Well you should be. It's borderline child abuse... just like corporal punishment, it's that same gray area.	I just don't understand the hygiene reasoning for circumcision. Most people shower or clean themselves at least every other day and it's not even hard to just pull it back and rinse the fucker. I've never had any problems with my penile hygiene and I haven't even been able to fully retract my foreskin until recently because of a medical problem.
Do guys daydream about finding the right girl?	Uhm, nope. I'm thinking about how the fuck I'm supposed to find a decent fuck buddy that I can improve and have fun with and have lots and lots of sex with. The closest thing I've come to thinking about a girlfriend is what kind of "dates" I could come up with. But us Swedes don't really date either. Relationships just seem to happen so I don't even know.	Definitely. I think about how she'll get on with my mom. Seriously, my mom always bonds with my girlfriends and stays in touch with them after I break up with them. It's funny. I think about how we'll do things together. I think about teasing her. Surprising her with flowers. How we'll hold hands. How she'll rest her head on my shoulder when we're at the movies or wherever. Or even just how we'll laugh together and joke and play fight and so on and so forth. It's not good for my health, that's for sure haha.
do you have any double standards in your relationships that are willing to admit to?	Tons. I'm okay with "admitting" them because I don't think that it's anything to hide - both my husband and I are okay with, and cherish, the fact that men and women are innately different and, as such, there will be different standards for either of us. Not everyone wants to be the same as their partner, so, for us, double standards aren't a bad thing	When she's taking care of the kids, she's "Working taking care of the boys." When I take care of the kids, I'm "Out having fun with the boys."
How do I, as a big sister, teach my teen brother not to be a douchbag?	Being a douchebag with women works so as long as he isn't abusive, don't worry about it. The drugs are a serious issue though. You may want to seek professional help for that.	Don't date douchebags and let him observe it. Expose him to women that don't give off the "men are disposable" vibe if possible. His breakup anger is something he'll have to deal with on his own unless he explicitly reaches out for some sort of dialogue.
You have been summoned to dog court on the grounds that you don't love dogs enough. How do you plead?	Guilty because i hate dogs Cool you want a dog? Thats fine i dont want a dog ive exercised my right to not be around a dog. But oh wait people dont control their dogs so they chase me into the street jumping and growling Ive been bit by "nice dogs" 4 times in my life and ive just about had it with them. Im killing the next dog that attacks or jumps at me. If you like dogs i suggest you keep it under control because that next dog might be yours	"Bitches and hounds of the jury, I have been called here on the carpet to answer the question of whether I love dogs or not. Well, I answer that question *with* a question- who's a good dog? *Who's a good dooooog?*" With that defense, I believe I would w-a-l-k.
Guys of reddit that have had low self-esteem or seen someone with it, how has it been dealt with?	You could do what a lot of guys do in that situation. Replace your lack of self-appreciation with a massive ego and become a douchebag. Hope that helps	You just have to keep moving on and putting yourself out there. The biggest change in my attitude came when I accepted three basic truths: [1] You cannot make anyone like you or care about you, no matter what you do. [2] You cannot dictate what is attractive to other people. [3] Neither #1 nor #2 adjusts your worth as a person or as a man. Once I realized that all this is true, then my whole outlook on life changed.
Have you ever had a girlfriend tell you to drop an existing female friendship? If so, how did that go?	It was very hard topic when i was with my ex. With new gf i made it clear that we never ever check our social network accounts. So i keep up the conversations there and meet my female friends once in a while in real life. Works like a charm :)	Is there any kind of back story? Context matters. Honestly it’s rarely “drop every girl you know.” Were you guys very close? Have a history? If you haven’t spoken to him in five months, is it that big a deal anyway?
Would you ever have sex in public? If you have, what happened?	Does the movie theater count? If so, it was awesome. With the lack of a condom she ended up taking a shot in the mouth then decided to spit it out at the end of the isle. And then literally, LITERALLY as soon as she sat back down a huge group of people walked into the theater. Shaunna if you're reading this...I miss you lmao	There is something very in touch with nature about fucking on a hike. Some of my favorite times having sex were bending a girl over a convenient boulder out in the wild. I tend to stay off of the main trails though, wouldn't be good to be balls deep in her when some family comes hiking up the trail.
When you see a woman wearing ANY kind of ring on her left ring-finger, do you assume she's engaged/married?	No, left ring finger is reserved for marriage ring. You aren't "allowed" to wear a ring on this finger unless you're married.	Usually that specific finger is reserved for being engaged/married and the like. And nowadays there are more and more people opting for other sorts of rings besides strictly getting a diamond one for getting engaged/married. So what I'm trying to say is yes, I do.
What made you lose physical attraction to a woman?	* Smashing the homies/Lovin the crew or whatever else they call it these days If she's banged any of my friends it's like EEEUGGGGUUGH! * Belly overhang. Hiding them with spanx upsets me. The bikini area is a triangle. If my eyes are on the same plane as her belly button and I can't see the top of that triangle, it's a turn off. You don't have to calculate my hypotenuse. I don't want to have to calculate yours * Turning me down for sex and not initiating after. Rejection fucking hurts.	I was in a relationship with her, it had been a long term relationship. She was unfaithful while I was visiting my family abroad, a trip she refused to join me on. I couldn't look at her again, the thought of the other guy in her just turned my stomach.
What do you think about dating someone a lot wealthier than you?	Knowing if I ever had kids with them I wouldn't have to worry about my kid's financial stability would be nice. Don't really care either way. Presents from her would have to be meaningful or made by her I guess.	I've done it. I'm from a VERY poor family. Girl had a multi-million dollar trust fund and was set for life. She had multiple condos in fancy areas of LA. I couldn't hang though. I knew I was pretty much there for the sex. Sample situation: I sent my younger brother a few hundred dollars so he wouldn't go hungry while waiting for his financial aid check. I then listen to her express her appreciation for what her pet psychic told her about her dog for $600. She was also very paranoid. If I didn't text/call her for a little while (few hours) she would frequently ask who I was with and whether or not I was sleeping with them.
What song or lyric makes you sad every time you hear it?	Montreal by The Weeknd is probably my pick, helps that it's my favourite song though. "Happiness exists when you don't know a thing", "Girl you could have had me doing anything you pleased" and "You probably could have had it all, you could have been that lonely star if we just went on" are probably my picks	I know someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky -- Pearl Jam You are forever in my heart you never died You are forever I still wonder where you are -- Nevermore
How many otters can I have before people started looking at me like that crazy otter guy?	One. Because no one goes out of their way to have an otter as a pet. Not even sure its legal...	Depends on which species of otter North American River Otter - 4 Asian Small Clawed Otter - 6 European Otter - 3 African Clawless Otter - 2 Sea Otter - 2 Giant Otter - 0
Why is loneliness among men such a huge problem and how do you cope with loneliness?	You have made a fundamental error in the premise of your question. Loneliness isn't pain, it is a somber companion. And most men are alone because we have to be. 90% of women want the top 10% of men or are happy with a house full of cats. So, just by sheer numbers, most of us wind up alone. C'est la gal. Golly, I sure hope I don't get a bunch of silent butthurt downvotes or whiny comments confirming my username...	It is a thing because we are taught not to rely on anybody else for help for the most part (in this world you're on your own as a man) and not to talk about things. Girls on the other hand are raised in a more social way and opening up easier in most cases. I myself am not a lonely guy but I don't have too many friends either. I don't get lonely easily because I really love being on my own. I find it easier and relaxing. Don't forget you can also be very lonely with many people around you. In fact if I had to choose a loneliest situation I remember it is one with many people.
How to deal with a friend who lies all the time?	Ok I'll explain this one the best way i can because i do it too, even some of my friends do it. It isn't because they are bragging. It is a way of telling a good story. For instance, If i just tell you i went to the supermarket its boring, but if i were to tell you about something funny or awkward that happened its more interesting. Go look at a couple of stand up comedians they do the same thing. Its their way of giving an entertaining perspective on an otherwise boring story.	OP, I had a friend who had a similar problem growing up. I would always just roll with it, because, what the hell, wasn't a big deal, right? Well, eventually I got sick of it. I went to town on him and brought up a bunch of his lies, telling him that I knew that he was lying and it really bothered me. I told him I was his friend no matter what and if he wanted to lie to other people, fine, but he was never to lie to me again. We had a huge falling out over it and it was awkward for about 6 months. Then we got over it and he hasn't lied to me since. Sometimes, straight up confronting a problem is the only way to fix it.
Might be a stupid question: what should I do if a stranger randomly molests a girl I'm with on the street?	You should have punched him in the face and pretended like she was your girlfriend or sister. Worse case scenario you get beat up.	Way I see it, you got three options: 1 Do what you did. 2 Do as others have said and call out the assaulter. Expect violence. 3 Go with crazy option. Yell out loudly "DUDE WHY DID YOU JUST GRAB MY DICK". Continue loudly asserting that this man did indeed grab your junk. I would be prepared for two things: violence and your lady friend calling 911. But I'd go #3. People don't want to fuck w/crazy. edit: counting is good
Have you guys ever faced rejection from a girl that you were great friends with? How did you handle it?	I stopped talking to her, blocked her on social media, and cut her out of my life. I don't do friendzones. BUY\-BYE	Happened to me in high school. Befriended a girl in freshman year, but grew to have feelings for her. I told my friend about my feelings a bit after the start of sophomore, but she didn't feel the same way. I ended up avoiding her afterwards because I couldn't deal, which ended up hurting her, and we went through HS ignoring each other's existence. A similar thing happened in college, but I just kept my mouth shut about it since nothing good would've come of it. I just created some distance between us.
Would you like it if your SO sent you flowers at work?	Don't send me anything at work!! I have a professional image to keep up and I don't need to look like a blushing school girl in front of my co-workers. Flowers are PDA (IMO) and should be kept for my private life. Edit: Sorry, thought this was ask women :(	flowers for women at work= physical object meaning SO cares about you flowers for man at work= physical object meaning SO wants to embarrass you.
What is your take on the spreadsheet husband?	Seems like misplaced effort to me. I'm curious, he lists all her "excuses", but he doesn't say how he approached her for sex. Sometimes you gotta put a little effort into seduction, even if you are a long term couple. And of course an email before leaving town is amazingly childish. I know we're only getting her side, but sounds like dude clearly has communication issues.	I think that it was a last, desperate attempt to get a point across. If this were the first time he brought it up, I'd say it was a massively passive aggressive move on his part. However, if this was an ongoing thing, I can undertsand it. Not how I'd deal with it, but I can understand it. I can easily imagine the husabnd saying things along the lines of "why do you always turn me down?" and answered with "You're exaggerating, stop making things up!" Bottom line, I'd need WAY more information before making a judgement call on it, but It doesn't take much to imagine a struggling relationship where this becomes a "reasonable" response to one partner or another. I see this is a red flag for a relationship in trouble. Period.
Men of Reddit, what would you do if your best friend sexually assaulted you gf?	Y'all ignoring the obvious here. You're with this guy..and his BEST friend is a sexual predator?! Whatever happened to "show me your friends and I'll tell u who you're..?" This is his best friend! He picked him! Their relationship is longer than yours. If I were you I'd audit what I have with this guy. Good luck	That mf’er would no longer be my friend. There would be a confrontation and I don’t know how it would go down, but it’s happening. In no way would my relationship with her change because of this. Hope you’re okay. Nobody deserves that shit.
Have you ever fallen for a girl who isn't your "type" and what is your story behind it?	Yeah typically I don't really have a type. Just a pretty face. A nice bum helps, but bust is far from important to me, as I am an adult. More often I'm looking for a girl who can keep a conversation up when needed but doesn't feel the need to talk all the god damn time. Stable, a full time job and isn't a bum.	My wife definitely isn't what most of my friends would consider my "type." She's quiet, introverted, a bit shy, not into partying, nor sports. I'm loud, extroverted, not shy, love a good party, and been a jock since I was in Kindergarten. But 11 years and 2 kids later we're still going strong.
Those of you who can afford to live independently but choose to live with parents in the meantime, what's your view on the American tradition of moving away from home asap?	Shortsighted and immature. One of my latino friends is an engineer. He lives in the south, makes like $80k/year, and lives with his parents. If I had to guess, I'd say he saves $50k/year.	It's weird to me. Being Asian, it's normal to stay with our families into our mid to late twenties or even until we get married. Yeah it sucks sometimes when my mom still calls to ask me where I am, but it's something that I can put up with for not having to paying +$1000 of rent a month. With this economy right now, there is a trend of a lot of people moving back in with their parents. Thank god, because I swear when I was on Okcupid, it was a deal breaker to a lot of white people to be living at home.
A girl whom I could have slept with but didn't just posted a picture of herself in a schoolgirl outfit. Which "what if"s keep you up at night?	is there really a point in thinking about what ifs? you make your decisions judging by what you feel is best for you at that time so there is nothing to feel bad about. you want sex? rub one out and with new clarity ask yourself what made you not sleep with her in the first place. for example if you didn't because you had a relationship already. good for you you are not a total asshole. if it was because she had a odd personality quirk. good for you never stick your dick in crazy. if it was simply because it wasn't the right time, well you always have priorities that come first that's life. move on	Honestly? Steel. Specifically, how to make steel. Had this weird late night *"what if I get sent back in time to the upper neolithic"* thought and I lay in bed for hours thinking about it, and the thing that most concerned me was that I didn't know how to make steel. So eventually I caved, booted up the PC and googled it; only after that was I able to sleep.
What is your hidden daily struggle?	Debating on what I want to do with the rest of my life. I want to go to graduate school. But for what? Psychology? Clinical research? Physician Assistant? I want to make good money, but have nice, normal hours. I also don't want to be in school for 6 more years or I would try for my MD. I am stuck.	I'm actually pretty good at my job. Which is good, because I don't have the focus to do it more than half of the work day.
What is the stupidest thing you've done in 2017?	Lost my virginity to my friend’s girlfriend (who is also kind of a hoe). I did it drunk and without protection and my crotch has been itchy for the past month. I didn’t even really find her attractive. Also, I got into a really stupid fender bender. Entirely my fault.	The stupidest thing I did in 2017 was getting back together with my ex. I'm not sure what I was thinking, she was really hot but certifiably insane. It ended very poorly and my heart in tatters again. And then I ended up messing up a great friendship because I was too needy and inadvertently made my friend choose between us. My friend said she didnt want to take any sides but it was clear that she sorta chose my ex over me. It was a double blow really. Thankfully I learned from all of this and I managed to not make any more major mistakes this year.
Men of Reddit, do you go out to bars and clubs alone and if so, how do you not appear creepy?	How not to appear creepy: Step 1. Don't act creepy. Step 2. If not sure see step 1. People are there to have a good time you should too. Nobody is going to be paying you any attention unless you do something crazy.	I go out alone all the time. To dinner, to bars, to the store. Usually no one finds me creepy, actually many people strike up conversations with me. I usually sit near the end of the bar away from everyone.
If feminism was renamed egalitarianism, do you think more men would get involved?	Most likely. Just like if moderate MRA renamed themselves, they'd get more women involved. But wouldn't that detract from the accomplishments of first and second wave feminists? That's shitty. Not to mention that rebranding a well established ideology seems to be more work than it's worth.	Yes, because a good number of feminists use the name to justify only focusing on women's issues, and even to justify excluding men from the group completely. And a lot of the other women in feminism just seem to go along with that, so as a male feminist you feel like no one has really got your back. If you changed the name, I think they'd have a lot less justification for doing so. You couldn't accuse men of mansplaining or derailing to shut down male voices. I'd bet a lot of reasonable people would leave the men's rights movement also. I don't want to be in the room with those guys, but feminism (at least on reddit) has sort of exiled people like me.
What would you do if your 14 year old (male) cousin left a bottle of piss in your house after visiting?	Send him a message:"What the fuck? Why did you piss in a bottle and then leave it here?" You can try to embarrass him all you want, but maybe he was just trying to be considerate by not going to the bathroom while everyone else is already asleep and simply forgot to do something about the bottle. Or maybe he didn't have the opportunity to dispose of it (guaranteed to be 'caught' with it). I think it's best if you'd actually ask *him* why he did what he did. One of the subreddit post guidelines is: > Do not make posts trying to figure out a specific person's actions, behavior, or thinking.	Tell your parents and let them decide what to do. I'm assuming its their house, so this is their problem. If this kid is your cousin, then one of them is probably brother or sister to the kid's mom, right? They need to discuss this with the kid's mother.
Do you find more women ogling you, or more men ogling your girlfriend/wife?	When I was in a relationship I found that most guys were checking my girl out because she had half her boobs sticking out and always wore really short shorts. I didn't care since I was the one who got to sleep with her. But I always wondered why she couldn't just pull her fucking shirt up. Oh wait she was an attention seeking cunt.	I find more men ogling me. I have been told I'm the epitome of a bear. I am flattered every time. Does that count?
What is it about dating/relationships that hasn't already been answered in at least 1000 previous threads would you like to ask in here?	What kind of dogfood would make for the most romantic third date dressed in dogsuits to show you're equally committed in sharing her love of dogs?	How in the hell are you supposed to find a dominant woman? Every woman I have met was submissive. I want someone who will be my big spoon, figuratively and literally.
AskMen, have you ever gone to a massage parlor and received a "happy ending"? What was the experience like, and would you do it again?	I live in Southeast Asia...it's basically a weekly occurrence. Massages are cheap here and the happy ending is the cherry on top. Edit...OP asks if you have ever gotten one and what it's like. Answer the question. Get downvoted. Good talk guys. Edit 2...it was at -1 when I wrote the first edit	Yes and no, I wouldn't. Army buddies paid for it for me on my birthday overseas in Korea, I said 'why not'? The experience was a really weird mix, the girl was pretty much bored. I chalk it up to experience. Tried it, wasn't thrilled, didn't really enjoy contributing to the sex trade, and it lacked almost everything I enjoy about sex.
How have your gaming habits changed as you've grown older?	I played up until PS2 came out. Then I discovered vagina at 16, and dropped the hobby all together. I still end up buying a console every gen, but they just collect dust. I've never even played a game on my PS3. It's just a pricey Netflix machine basically. Or I connect my external drive to it and watch movies. I'll sometimes play flash version of old NES games. But that's about it. New games just don't seem entertaining to me. They just all seem that same. Oh look, another first person shooter. Oh look, another Call of Duty. Much like movies and TV, nothing is original anymore. Resident Evil 2 was the last really entertaining game to me.	>Do you still game? Yes. But I probably only buy 3-5 games per years these days, and may never beat any of them. >Have you ever felt a pressure to stop playing because gaming is, in the eyes of some, an activity for children or teens? Not in the slightest. All of my friends and coworkers play some manner of video game in their spare time. Even the most stolid "video games are stupid" lady I know has Candy Crush on her phone. >How do you respond to that perception? By laughing it off. There are way worse ways I could be spending my free time. As I've gotten older, I've simply learned to split my time more equitably, and naturally games take a back seat to other priorities. But they are still my main hobby when I have the free time to enjoy them.
What are the chances of peeing in my girlfriends mouth when I’m asleep?	I would say, if you aren't already erect then go for it. If you are erect then you probably have to pee.	Well, first of all, unless it's a usual thing for you to wet the bed, I don't see why you should randomly pee in that specific case. Other than that, it's *highly* unlikely that you won't immediately wake up from it. EDIT: My most highly rated comment is now about peeing in your girlfriend's mouth. Perfect!
Do you know when girls have a crush on you and what is giving them away?	I mean is the girl acting in a way that would make you think she was a lesbian if she treated a girl that way? That's only way really	Sometimes. Usually not, but we'll suspect something if she's being unusually friendly or giggly. I usually just assume she's being friendly until she starts dropping sexual references or suggests we do something just the two of us sometime.
What sub-reddits are you guys subscribing to that aren't the obvious ones?	Oh baby, where can I start. /r/games A lightyear beyond the quality of /r/gaming. /r/askwomen A great laugh. What terrible advice, all the time. /r/Floridaman The worst superhero. /r/fatpeoplestories Just go read. /r/pcmasterrace Despite the circlejerk, occasionally a good resource for sales and deals on parts. In conjunction with /r/buildapc There are so, so many more. /r/justneckbeardthings. /r/enlightenedbirdmen. /r/gaming4gamers. If you're so inclined, /r/theredpill. On that last one: 80% crap, 20% amazing self improvement advice. Edit: my god, how could I forget: /r/dadjokes /r/fiftyfifty /r/beer	/r/askhistorians . Note that the moderation is extremely strict, posting joke answers on more than one occasion tends to be met with a ban. This policy is extremely popular on the sub, and it has made the sub a great place to actually learn. I'd recommend just reading unless you have experience in formal history academia. /r/NFL Quality's declining a bit as the sub grows, but still a great place for NFL news and discussion. Tone of the community is both welcoming and full of trash-talking. /r/FrugalJerk /r/Scotch /r/Games Higher quality, more on topic take on /r/gaming. Quality is slowly starting to decline a bit. /r/PCMasterRace /r/UpliftingNews
What was the best and the worst response you received from your partner during/after you had sex?	The good- "You're a god!"😎 The bad- "Seriously? That was it? 🤷‍♂️ The ugly- "Your brother was better"☹️ The Best- "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"🤤	The Good: She stood up out of bed and fell down from jelly legs. The Bad: "Don't worry - it happens to a lot of guys" The Ugly: "Really???? Already???"
Have you ever said yes to a woman making the first move?	As with most threads on the internet, this one has strong selection bias - you're going to get the minority of the male population who would say yes to a woman approaching and men who are more liberal/submissive.	I've been asked out three times in my life. I said yes twice and no once. I think what we're seeing on /r/askwomen is that women ask someone out, get turned down once and figure that the whole venture is a waste of time. Newsflash: that's *exactly* how it works for guys asking girls out. We get rejected a lot. Men have had to deal with it for years and women are just recently starting to understand it.
Homosexual men, is domestic violence as big an issue for homosexual couples as it is for heterosexual ones?	Domestic violence in same-sex relationships occurs with about the same frequency as it does in opposite-sex relationships, but it tends to be reported less and there are fewer resources available for victims. Also, we prefer the term gay, just so you know.	It can be. My first boyfriend broke a few of my bones, and I've called the cops on him. This was like... 10+ years ago though.
Married men with kids: how was sex different (good or bad) after your first baby? Was there any thing that could have made it better?	What sex? After my daughter was born I had two lovers. Ms. Hanna and Ms. Palm. Sex is dead. I’m dead on the inside too.	My wife didn’t do any of that, I watched my child be born in vivid detail and it had absolutely zero impact on our sex life. Obviously there was some downtime after the birth, but once we were back in the saddle is was just as often and satisfying as always. Still is 12 years and 3 kids later.
Guys who have dated someone who you weren't fully physically attracted to...how did it affect your relationship, and how did your attraction to them develop over time?	Erectile disfunction. Cheated on her. Made her dress up in specific outfits, but that’s a thing anyway. Frankly, I’ve dated uglier girls that I like personally and thus found beautiful. Men see beauty where we want to.	Felt like I was just going through the motions and dating just to be dating. Looks aren't the most important aspect of relationships but there has to be a level of physical attraction that draws you to the girl. Without the sexual attraction, what you've really got is just a friendship.
As a male, what are the cons of getting married and having kids in your 30s/40s instead of your 20s?	You're over 50 before they're out of the house. Don't have kids if you consider yourself at all selfish. Don't have kids if your life sucks, because your kids' life will probably suck worse. Kids are a pain in the ass, expensive, a literal life-long commitment. There's a chance you'll get a retard or a gimp and you'll be stuck taking care of the kid like a baby for the rest of your life. Do you want to be 75 and changing the diaper of a 40 year old? Enjoy your life, there's no good reason to have a kid and there are plenty of reasons not to.	You'll leave them sooner. If you have a kid when you're 20, you'll be 40 when they're 20. If you have a kid when you're 40, you'll be 60 when they're 20.
What non-sexual / non-relationship themed question is on your mind right now?	What's a good method of souicide that leaves no mess and minimizes trauma for people that love you, and the person that finds you?	Why did shows like "This Old House" and "The Joy of Painting" disappear and why is television flooded with reality shows?
What are your unpopular sex opinions?	People on Reddit tend to put too much emphasis on the woman's pleasure. Like for example whenever someone asks for advice about having a small penis guaranteed all the comments just say "get better at oral/fingering" instead of actually helping the young man's self confidence. They act like sex is literally just being a human vibrator for a woman or something and not two people expressing their passion for each other.	It takes time to build sexual chemistry and giving somebody the hook after a bad outing isn't fair. I was talking to this lady on hinge and she said she wanted full on tantric love making... right out the gate. Like dude it takes some time for me to build that sort of connection with somebody. I can't throw 100 down the pipe without a little warmup.
Whenever I get acquainted with a woman I develop a “crush” on them. I don’t actually like them romantically, I’m just excited over the idea of a relationship. How do I stop this?	If you start going out with a girl, an imperative thing to honour is the three month rule. Don't make it serious until after three months, because at that point you essentially know if you like them for them or you like the idea of them (i.e. crushing on them). At 3 months, if you are honest with yourself, you will be able to decide whether it is a good match or not.	I was always that way when I first met a new girl. The newness wears away and if you really like them, you'll know. You are totally normal.
What is the story you are proud of but can't just bring because it would sound like you're bragging?	I'm sleeping with 3 hot girls that have significant others, I don't bring it up because it sounds like I'm bragging and makes me look like a douchebag in some people's eyes at the same time EDIT: See what I mean?	I definitely have one of those. In February 2011, I was working for a medical software company. One of our clients was NASA. They blew up a system and it needed put back together in order to keep the schedule for the final launch of the Discovery shuttle in 10 days. I saved a shuttle launch by being really fucking good at my job.
What "type" of girls (or guys) do you typically attract? Are these girls (or guys) the "type" you find yourself attracted to?	I attract stereotypical neckbeards because of my nerdy interests and black dudes because, for a white girl, I apparently have a bit of a booty and I'm also in the minority on my side of town. I'm attracted to atheletic, socialized nerds. I want someone who will run a 5K with me one weekend and go to comic/anime convention with me the next. Also, at 5'9", I am one of those evil women who like men taller than me.	Spooky gals. The number of ghosts, spirits, psychics, demonic posessions, tongues-speakers, and shamans (shawomans?) I've encountered in my past ~9 years of relationships is way too damn high.
Whenever I'm dating a woman, I usually end up sacrificing my own happiness to make her happy. Anybody else do that? Why do we do this??	As a man put your happiness first. No one else will. Now it just so happens that it makes us happy to have our SOs happy. However a man who rushes around kissing her ass and saying "happy wife happy life" MIGHT be the sorta bitch of a man that no woman can respect. Women want a dynamic and strong man who has a mission in life beyond them.	Every relationship involves sacrifice. I sacrifice my happiness for my wife all the time. She sacrifices hers for me. This is the nature of human interaction. It's an issue when you sacrifice everything and you're the only one doing the sacrificing. Don't do that. However, make sure your eyes are open and can see when she's giving things up for you. A lot of people only notice their own losses.
A woman that you have gone on a couple of dates with asks you over to her place at 10pm on a Friday to watch a movie and says "I hope you like alcohol because I have a lot." How do you think the night will go?	If she invited you over to chill and watch a movie, there’s a very strong chance you were invited over to chill and watch a movie. She was probably down for the night to go in either direction but your pushing made her uncomfortable and she shut down. Sorry you didn’t get laid. But hey, now you know.	I'll get blackout drunk and deliver one of my famous drunken monologues on whatever off brand topic is on my mind this week before waking up in the morning hung over and embarrassed.
Do men enjoy "only" kissing/making out without the promise of sex/intimacy by the end?	Blue balls... personally I am convinced that this phenomenon was coined by some twig of a greaser thirty years ago whose girlfriend was not ready for sex yet. It depends on the situation, does it not? It is not a very good policy to 'expect' anything from another person, but I do not think it would be an unreasonable assumption that sex would follow a heavy make-out session with someone you were already intimately aware of. It would be pretty brutish to expect sex be the end result of every touch, kiss, tickle, or prod however. Blue balls is such a joke to me, though. The only 'pain' I have ever felt from being denied sex was emotional pain, not physical.	To an extent, but it gets old. A few minutes is fine if we're alone together, but if there's no progression I get bored. If we're at a bar or out on the town, I'm fine with a little make out session, but again, I'm going to be thinking about progressing to sex later.
When one says “we’ll have sex all night” what time do you actually stop and go to bed?	when I can't get hard anymore and she is begging me to stop. so around...1230 or 1 am. happens most friday nights.	Whenever that's happened it's usually devolved into what I called "slex", which is basically sex, you cuddle and fall asleep, then you both wake up and have sex again and the cycle keeps repeating until sunrise.
Men who have done white collar and blue collar jobs: Which do you prefer, and why?	Programming > blue collar > white collar > retail I don't really like white collar, but I love programming so it overrides it.	I prefer white collar jobs because I have made more money doing so with stable hours. I loved doing the blue collar jobs though, just so much more interesting day to day work. It was nice getting a solid workout every day without hitting the gym and an actual sense of accomplishment. I didn't like the unsteady work flow and at times the hours were completely random. If I could work a blue collar job with the current pay and guaranteed (stable) hours, I would most likely switch over for a few years.
Men who had kids after not wanting them for years, how's that working out for you?	Not quite what you're asking, but my ex girlfriend got pregnant a while ago, around the time when we broke up. I've always said I don't want kids and I still don't, but she got an abortion against my wishes and I still hate her. In my mind she'll always be the bitch that killed my child for convenience. I was willing to raise my child on my own if she didn't want it, but she wasn't willing to do that. I still think it's fucked up I have 0 say.	Pretty good actually. I had a son and it turns out he doesn't like kids either so we got that in common.
What compliment did you receive that you knew was not true?	Have not had anyone compliment on something that is not true, i am kind of perfect and people don't really complement me enough. My cooking is on par with the world top chefs. My looks are the definition of the golden ration of beauty. My driving skills are better than professional drivers. My personality is a mix of all the saints that have lived. I could brake every world record in any sport if i had the time for it. And i could answer every question science can come up with if i would not be so busy saving damsels in distress from dragons and evil knights.	Bro walked in while i was making dinner. He smiled and said "something smells good"i then showed him all i had done up until then was boil water.
How old are you? And whats the most important thing in your life right now?	21- my 1 year old daughter and my boyfriend (not her biological dad but so much better than that). They are both blessings in my life and remind me to keep going and getting high grades in college so I can build a better future for us. Boyfriend is doing the same and treats baby like she is his own even though he became her "dad" when she was 6 month old. Her "sperm donor" bailed. My boyfriend is infinitely better and I think to myself every day how I got so lucky to have met and found this man. I love them both so much!	50- most important thing in my life is finding peaceful living and avoiding drama and “side hustle/grind” culture. Slowing down, seeing the world around me and enjoying life in the present.
What do you think could be done to lower male suicide rate?	I think the male success rate is higher, because men choose more violent methods. Women tend to want to leave a pretty corpse, so they use less successful methods, but in fact they attempt suicide more. Both of these statistics are bad, and I think in order to lower attempted suicide for women and successful suicide for men, our mental health care system needs reformation.	Stop stigmatizing mental health care, stop viewing men as weak for having feelings, stop treating men like we're disposable, stop denying men support when we reach out for it. I could go on but it's late.
What do you cook for a date?	TFW I can only make frozen food So anything frozen that's delicious And LMAO at OP > "What do you want to eat?" > "I don't know whatever you want is fine." TFW I no longer get that because foreveralone	Something light so I don't feel like a cow if we bone. Maybe fish, veggies, pasta (no cream sauce). White wine.
[NSFW] What are some sexual thoughts you have that you are ashamed of?	I'm interested in incest. Ladyboys too. Always wanted to fuck my mom and sister. Some cousins too. Want to see a ladyboy fuck my wife while I watch and perhaps fuck the ladyboy in the ass.	I wonder what it would be like to have sex from the girl's point of view. That said, I'm a guy so I'll never really know.
Fellas, what's the most obvious sign from a girl that you missed?	Picture me at a frat party. This is before the new rape bullshit, so two drunk people could fuck without it being rape. We are talking about how good life is, she leans in for a kiss, I boop her on the nose, with my finger. Literally saying the word boop. I don't really remember much after that, but I woke up alone.	She was backing upto me in bed while we were watching Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. I ignored the fuck outta her because the only horn that was getting blown was the Horn of Helm Hammerhand and nobody was interrupting that. My facebook group chat name is two towers now since my friends found out.
How can I help my younger brother who's being bullied?	This may not be the wisest answer, but if he just whoops the bully's ass once everyone will hear about it and he'll be left alone the rest of his time at that school. Just one solid punch in the gut. For real though, I'm not about that not fighting back life. You stand up for yourself and if you are attacked you defend yourself. If he's not good with words you may need to give him some lines so he's ready to whip them out.	Well, you should be there for support and life advice. Try to make him understand that scumbags exist everywhere, and he needs to understand he doesn't have to take shit from anyone nor will he have to see these people when he finally graduates from school. Maybe encourage him to exercise, learn how to defend himself?
My brother is falling into the hands of a gang, how do I stop it?	Throw a knife at the gang's hand. Your brother cant fall into the hands of a gang if its hands are disabled.	The gang is giving him a sense of belonging and purpose. You have to give him a better counter offer.
How do I tell this to my husband without making him feel bad?	Sell or pawn the ring. Tell him you won a scratch off lottery ticket. Suggest you take the "winnings" to buy rings.	I'm not exactly sure how you can bring it up, but I would suggest that you make sure to reiterate very clearly that it's just a ring and its source has no bearing on your love for him.
Non-smoking men in relationships, how much do you care if your s/o smokes or not? Single men, if you find out an attractive girl smokes, how much does it change your opinion of her?	the amount of people for whom smoking would be a dealbreaker here is fucking weird to me. i don't smoke (maybe a cigarette or two when drunk), but there are so many factors about a person that would completely trump smoking for me. in the right people's hands, smoking can be downright sexy. yeah, the taste and the smell of a habitual smoker aren't all that great, but if i found them otherwise attractive, i wouldn't notice it at all.	It's an absolute dealbreaker. I'd be devastated if my wife took it up. My mom and dad died 6 days apart because of that shit a few years ago, and (all other reasons aside, of which there are many) I don't want to go through that again with my wife.
Is your wife taking your last name important to you?	Yes. The entire institution of marriage is based on the tradition of formalizing your relationship. If a woman would not take my name, I would not marry her - simple as that.	Well she took her ex's last name when they were married, so I'd be a little perplexed if she wouldn't take mine.
Men whose wives or girlfriends got implants, do her boobs feel differently to you? Are you glad she got them?	Honest question from a women: How come (most?) men are attracted to implants? Doesn't it bother you that they are FAKE, and not actually "her". I.e. I couldn't be attracted to fit looking man, if i knew all of his "muscles" are actually implants.	My wife got implants about 5 years ago because she was always self conscious about her small boobs. She had her nipples centered a the same time. She now is fairly large and very happy about it. On the other hand, I'm far more attracted to small boobs than her new large ones and am now less sexually attracted to her. She also lost most of the feeling in her nipples which means that even if I was attracted to larger boobs, there would be no point in playing with them because she can't feel it anyway. Would we do it again? She says yes as she is much happier with the way she looks. I say no and wish we had never done it in the first place.
How do I talk to my son?	How about you actually read books about it. Or, simpler, when you were a kid, what do you wish you got from your daddeeh? Either way, no kid wants to talk about school, they hate it	Take him on activites. I never had a dad, he was around but it was just awkward, I didn't see him that much. Honestly, just be around, just be there, play some ball. But don't force anything, just try to hang around, eventually he'll get comfortable around you. It's your son for god's sake.
Did the words of the Santa Barbara shooter seem similar to some posters on reddit to you?	"Killing all of those women"? He killed two women and four men. The two women were random fatalities, while three of the four men were targeted. Can we please stop talking about this guy like he's the new Lisbeth Salander villain?	The last few days have been full of people contacting me, asking if I've heard the news about the shooter - and of course, asking if I'm going to snap and start shooting people any time soon. I guess that speaks volumes about how bitter I am at my lack of success with women.
Men, have you ever felt your standards dip out of horniness?	Kudos to you for being able to even get it up for a girl you're not that into. Personally, it isn't even an option for me. I cannot get aroused around someone I'm not really, really into, so lowering my standards isn't really an option for me. That's not to say I'm holding out for a model as such, my tastes are pretty reasonable, but I like what I like and if I can't get someone to fit the profile of what I like, I just have to go without. Not much flexibility there I'm afraid =/ Like, I could never tell myself "Meh, she's only a 6, but I'll do her". I have to be jerking off to her nightly to warrant the chase lol.	I feel like half the questions in this sub are written by 12-year-olds just due to the sheer obviousness of the answer
Use a throwaway if you must. What "dumb" sports question have you always been too embarrassed to ask?	Okay, it's almost philosophical but... Why do you insist in American football to tackle with your head? I mean why people only realize now that it's somewhat damaging. Edit: Why the downvotes? It's a genuine question and I thought we were here to ask the embarrassing ones...	My question: when the ball goes out of bound in basketball, how does the receiving team choose who is going to pass it back in? It seems like it just gets decided with no communication.
What is the closest you have ever been to dying?	New Year's Eve a couple years back. I was driving drunk on a dark, winding country road. I dozed off several times and would wake up to find I'd drifted into the opposite lane. Finally when I dozed off again I drifted onto some blocks that were lining the road and blew out both tires on that side. Luckily this happened right in front of my cousins and their friends who were hanging out by the side of the road. Most of whom happened to be mechanics. They replaced both tires in a matter of minutes and I made it home (now scared awake). Yea, I'm honestly surprised I lived through that night. I'm pretty sure there's multiple universes where I died in a horrific car accident.	I was working on my car in my driveway. It was only up on a jack which, apparently, was failing, unbeknownst to me. I was the only one outside at the time and the jack had been very slowly descending as I was under the car. The next thing I knew it was right on my chest, and still slowly descending. It was getting to be very difficult to breathe, and my vision was narrowing down to a very small circle. AT about this time my buddy (who has zero mechanical knowledge or ability) came out of the house. I somehow managed to communicate to him how to operate the jack. He got the car off of me just as my vision was down to a pinpoint. So... a few seconds from death. That's how close.
Men of Reddit.. what insecurities do woman have about themselves but it doesn’t really bother you?	For some woman. Less make-up would work better. More ≠ better. For some even none is better. Its really diffrent per person. But never overdo it	Being too tall. I’m only 5’5, I have no room to be picky about a woman’s height. That, and I find tall women attractive
Is it okay to ask from your SO what porn he watches?	I think it is an invasion of privacy, but I also think more importantly that it is a question that is begging for a non-answer. Honestly, what good could possibly come out of answering this question honestly? No man would give you an unvarnished, brutally honest answer to, "So, what gets your rocks off in private when you need to bust a load before heading out to work?" Besides, many times what serves its purpose in private can be different to who we are attracted to in our dating lives.	Biggest question for you, do you really want to know what he likes to watch? So be careful what you might ask for, you can't unknow what he tells you.
What's the best way to tell you that you're wearing way too much cologne?	Any is too much. I want to smell like me, and want to be with people who want to smell me that way.	"Hey I dont mean to be rude, but you're putting on too much cologne and it's giving me a headache. Could you please tone it down in the future?"
What does /r/AskMen think of this "Peter Pan Syndrome" shaming on men lately?	I think it's weird if someone is in their late 20's/early 30s and not putting any effort into getting out of their parents house. It;s also a bit strange if they are not dating or trying to date. I mean, if that makes you happy, cool. But what's going to happen when mom and dad get old and sick or pass away? You'll have no work experience and need to get a job. It won't be a good time.	My main reaction to the link provided is "my God, what a badly-written article." Really, it's a mishmash of half-pursued topics, even leaving the writing itself out of it. I guess some people aren't doing what other people expect of them, basically. There's a lot to pick through in this specific link (I mean, she goes from 'kinda laid-back' to 'dudes with real issues' and back again) but I would put out there the idea that, as in many areas of life, you find what you measure and you get what you reward.
Who's the dumbest person you've ever met and why?	To be completely honest probably my mother. I have met thousands of people in my life but no one really stacks up to her. I don't enjoy trash talking her cause she is a good person morally but intellectually she really is just kinda lost. She doesn't know what an atom is, where most countries on Earth are, the planets, what air is composed of, what the big bang theory is, and pretty much every fundamental fact about the universe we live in.	A girl I went on a date with. I don't remember how the conversation got there, but she legit thought WW2 and nazis was just a movie thing. I thought she was kidding at first, but she was dead serious.
What are important things women need to realize about men?	That your career doesn't mean jack shit to men who have the means to take care of themselves. Men aren't attracted to the same things that women are. Men primarily want beauty/intimacy and cooperation/inspiration. Men of means don't care if your a fry cook or if your a lawyer because money to men who can take care of themselves and provide for a family don't need yours. If your a woman and your offended by this and ask your self the simple question.. What percentage of the financial load do you want to be responsible for your family for the rest of your life in a marriage? If you ever wanna be a stay at home mom or spend significant time with your kids after giving birth your going to have think seriously about this question and the type of man you want AND WHAT THEY WANT.	Stop fretting! If I'm quiet, it doesn't mean I'm mad. Maybe I'm thinking about work, or money, or you, or the kids. Or why I have goddamn ear and nose hair. If I'm upset, you will know.
Men of reddit who’ve dated or are currently dating a disabled partner (blind, deaf, physically handicapped, etc.) what is it like and how did you start dating?	I used to date a girl in a wheelchair. She was funny, and it was great, we met when we got in a car wreck and I broke her spine.	Not a crazy disability but I dated a girl with a glass eye - she had an infection of some sort as a child and had to have one eye removed. She had some minor difficulties but managed to learn how to drive and all that just fine. She had the best sense of humor about it though. Back in the early 2000’s before emojis we just sent smiley faces like :) and ;) and so on. However she always just used one dot like .) and ,)
How do you meet introverted women?	Break into houses. The cop that arrests you might be a female, and they might be introverted. With this method you also have a solid opening conversation as she is probably into justice and the law. Talk about that and see where it goes.	introverted doesn't nessesarly mean shy or anti-social. you'll have a hell of a time trying to small talk, but i find many introverts can talk a storm if you hit a topic they're interested or passionate about. with that in mind, use that to your advantage. since your introverted too, meet women at places your passionate about. comic conventions, libraries, museums, churches, concerts, whatever floats your boat.
What is the reason for smelling women's hair?	I've personally never done it, but I did have a girlfriend that did it to me. It's like she was snorting coke or something sometimes.	Your scent. Your scent is a very powerful aphrodisiac. It is normal throughout the entire animal kingdom. Hard to resist and always intoxicating.
How often do you drink?	3-5 days a week. A bottle of wine a night isn't too bad, although what's his weekends like? > Side note/personal question: Would it be rude of me to ask him not to drink when we are out for dinner with my parents? I would bring it up that your parents brought it up to you.	Most evenings i'll have 2/3 pints of beer, on Friday and Saturday night that number will be closer to 8/9
How often do you cry?	once every 2 years, and it's not so much feminine in my eyes. crying or showing *any* emotions at all is a sign of not having your shit together. a crying man is a loser, an overjoyed one an idiot, and if you openly claim to love someone you're weak. being in touch with my emotions means little to me; they're not welcomed by anyone or so it seems. men aren't valued personally, our needs and desires are thought of as silly or dangerous and expressing ourselves makes us a burden for those around. men are supposed to fix shit. Get a house, maintain a family, take care of those around you and be nice doing all of it. we're a kind of employee to life: valued for actions, not looks or personality.	not real often. The birth of my son got a few tears out of me. I do love being a dad. Sometimes a movie will get a little well up but not actual crying.
Men of Reddit, would you date someone with depression or anxiety? If not, why not? If yes why yes?	NO. Because it's not worth it and it's bad for you. Why would you willingly sign up for relationship that will only make you unhappy I'm the long run... I very much support the idea that if you want to have romantic relationships, love and all that stuff, FIX yourself first! Don't expect other people to fix you. Fix yourself and THEN look for a partner (bf/gf).	I've been there. Dated someone for a year who was clinically depressed and had major anxiety issues. It was very challenging, and honestly it was probably a big part of why we didn't work out (though not the only reason). I think I'd still date someone who had these issues, but I'd need to see that they were adequately treating dealing with them. Left unchecked, these issues are toxic to relationships. But I wouldn't consider them dealbreakers because I know people who have them, deal with them, and are able to function normally.
Men who hate their mothers: Why?	I don't hate *her*, I hate things she did to me: * got me circumcised * raised me in a church * crafted me into a Nice Guy™	She took my sister and I to the homes of the guys she was cheating on my dad with and would put us in the basement (lights off) while they fucked upstairs and we'd have to wait for several hours sometimes. That bothered me so much as a kid and the memories of it nearly ruined sex for me. She'd beat up my sister, and told me what a bad son I was. She made us feel worthless. I still keep in touch and our relationship is getting better. But I have no intention of letting her near my family if I ever start one
Men of reddit, how are you a rebel?	I'm an active member of an anarcho-syndicalist organization. I spend my evening handing out agitational pamphlets outside of warehouses (very successfully, I might add) or writing satirical songs attacking local authority figures. My days are spent organizing in my main workplace (my second job is a worker-run food shelf), and my other hours organizing in my tenement block and my neighborhood. On weekends I write letters to our imprisoned members. I've gone toe-to-toe with counter-protestor vigilantes, and on some occasions had to meet force with force. I've gone toe-to-toe with the police too, for which reason I'm currently facing charges. Also, I intentionally give wrong directions to yuppies and tourists who visit my neighborhood. So, that's fun.	I wore a graphic tee to my job today, and we're not allowed to. They've been pissing me off a lot recently #passiveagressive
Quarantine forced us to take a hard look at ourselves. What were you surprised to discover about yourself recently?	Scary, that u ll leave home n u might not see ur family again. Trust issues. U question everyone that is close to you n in the back of ur mind u thinking hope that are true to you. Today I question my brother cos some one he was in contact couple of days ago n they are positive.	I'm tired of my abusive family and now I can accept that they will never change. Edit: wow, thank you so much for your support and for sharing your story! I've been reading you but I just rescued a kitten so I'll respond later! Thank you people!!
What is your policy on paying for first dates?	I'm from Sweden. That is not custom here. We both pay because we are both there on equal terms, finding out if we like the other person. If we are at the dinner there's a chance we are already serious by now. But let's say we're not. If you expect me to pay for you. I will expect you to put out for me. Simple as that. If you're there for a paid meal I'm there for some quick pussy. We won't be seeing each other after that.	I usually go for a casual drink for a first date, although most of my dates are from online so perhaps a different situation. I always get the first drink for us. If she is game for a 2nd drink i like to see if she offers to pay, its a good quality if she does. Im always happy paying for the first drink though
What do you find attractive in women that others may not?	I like smaller boobs. Like B cup is perfect When tits get too big I think they look gross undressed. And time DESTROYS big boobs.	When I see questions like this I don't feel I find anything out of the ordinary attractive. I'm a simple guy with simple needs.
What "culture(s)" do you despise?	The fucking mainstream media. They are such biased non thinking pieces of shit. Their defense of Hillary Clintons lies and illegal activities disgusts me. Instead of addressing the allegations being thrown at her, they reflexively dismiss the attacks and attempt to discredit the attackers. The classic "no true Scotsman" fallacy - the idea that since they think republicans are all assholes, that everything they say is wrong. Edit: I don't watch Fox News. I'm basing my views on actual events I witnessed on other networks like CBS, CNN, CNBC. It's clear to any objective observer that these networks have the default assumption that democrats are well intentioned and correct, and republicans have bad intentions and are incorrect. Regardless of the facts. There is sometimes no discussion of the facts by the anchor/reporter, they just disagree because of distrust.	"Prank Culture" this idea that pranks aren't funny unless someone's person or personal belongings are damaged. I saw a video the other day of a guy slapping random strangers on the back of the head and claiming it was a prank, no you're just an asshole who documented himself being an asshole
How do you deal with other men hitting on your attractive girlfriend in your presence?	It's disrespectful and it can very easily lead to violence. My reaction depends on how I perceive the other guy - Is he weaker or stronger than me? Does he look like a man with a tendency to violence? etc. Usually in a situation such as this I will let my body language speak instead of my mouth. For example I will stand very close to my woman in order to convey a message of *"Move along. She is mine"*.	"My girlfriend is deaf, but I can hear you just fine." Seriously though, everyone who said let her handle it is right, but if she gets cornered or is uncomfortable go ahead and give her an out. "Hey babe let's go dance/get a drink/make out in the corner/make babies!"
Men in their 20s, what’s a development in your life teenage you would have never seen coming?	Heartbreak and coming to terms that the life-long relationships of the generations before us are dead and gone. It forced me to become a selfish person when I didn’t want to be because kindness and loyalty are no longer appreciated. But in my selfishness I gained a level of reverence from people that I’d never had before. It makes interacting with people hard because I’m just not a dickhead at heart, so every relationship in which I wish not to be disrespected at some point seems fake and forced, and every relationship in which I wish to be kind and selfless seems like an exercise in how much pain I can take. I learned quickly that people aren’t for me.	Turns out grown up me really loves cooking, and with that, I really like shopping for new ingredients to cook with. Teenage me would certainly be raising an eyebrow.
AskMen, What are some relationship red flags?	Fat entitled hairy feminists are the ultimate turn off. The closer you are to that the less attractive you are.	* Indicating that she thinks violence is an acceptable way to resolve a dispute * Indicating that she views sex as transactional * Entitlement to a certain standard of living that she is not providing for herself * Inability to save money or follow a budget * Ill treatment of people who are required to be nice to her * Attention-seeking behavior (maintaining an army of instagram/facebook orbiters, etc) * Racism, classism, sexism
What is the most humiliating thing a woman has done to you?	A girl in middle school did that pretended to be interested thing. I knew what was up though. I have had ex's do some crazy and underhanded shit, but not really humiliating outside of cheating.	One night she got pissed at me and went into great detail about how her ex was hung like a porn star and he hit all the right spots that my dick just couldn't touch and how she fantasized about him when we had sex etc etc. At that time I was very inexperienced and I was very insecure about myself sexually, so this did a number on me. I was totally devastated, she had confirmed every fear and insecurity I had about myself.
Men who (appear to) have your shit together, what issues are you currently dealing with?	Serious question (maybe another thread is in order) why are so many of you guys complaining about lack of companionship? Why do you so urgently need one? Some of you even claim to be successful in short term things. Why do you want the long term thing? Why do you think it would improve your life?	Lonely. Very very lonely. The only person I've got to talk to is 3 hours away and I only hear from him like once a month.
Men who have a smaller than average penis, what's the proper reaction from someone you're hooking up with?	How is “smaller than my pinky” possible? I feel bad for dude. But since he’s an asshole. He deserves to have a babydick. Honestly the best reaction to a baby dick. I don’t even know. If he never told you about it in advance then good luck I think?	I mean... OP, there's smaller than average and then there's smaller than your pinky finger. That's micropenis territory. The chance of it happening again is pretty small (heh), but definitely acting like nothing's wrong isn't the way to go. The guy isn't stupid, he knows what he's packing. If it's *too small*, be honest. Let him know it's not working, so he can find other ways to please you. Toys, his hands, his mouth, etc. Also, check with him to see what's the best way *you* can make him feel good. Communication is the singular, most important thing in any sort of relationship. If you're comfortable sucking his dick, you should be comfortable discussing it.
Do you ever feel like society swears men don’t have emotions and only women do?How has this effected you?	To be fair, women’s emotions are invalidated constantly. How many times have you seen a woman be called crazy or hysterical?	It does seem that the only two acceptable emotions for a man are happiness and anger. And nobody wants to be around someone who’s angry. I personally deal with this; I’ve held my emotions in for so long, it seems anger is the only one I’m comfortable expressing, so everything that’s not happiness comes out as anger.
Other than technique, what makes a blowjob special?	A pretty face with puppy dog eyes. Moaning, groaning, humming. If she makes the same sexy moans she makes when eating her favourite food then it's gonna be a quick blowjob.	Not having to ask for one. A random and spontanious blowjob. EDIT: Lol guys, I've never had a BJ in my life.....hahahaha... :(
Guys that have gotten divorced, what surprised you most about the process itself, and the change in your life after is was done?	So sorry to hear all the trouble everyones gone through - what made you think in the first place to get married / love such a person? Weren't the signs visible early on? Even before getting married? Or did their awkward/selfish traits developed overtime?	>I was also absolutely floored by the venom my ex had to get out before she could let go. It went on for years. Ugh, my mother did that after she and my father got divorced. There is an African saying "When the elephants fight the grass gets trampled". People, if you care about your kids, don't trash your ex in front of your kids. S/he may be YOUR ex, but s/he is YOUR CHILD'S parent. Trashing an ex in front of your kid messes them up emotionally and makes them resent you. Lose/Lose
At what point do I tell a girl that Im dating multiple people?	> Is it even neccesary? Yes since women will assume you are seeing them only. > At what point should I bring up that Im seeing seeing other people? This is tricky to answer since there is no right answer. Some day immediately, some say after you established a mutual attraction and gotten to know each other, some say after the first time you had sex. Ideally, as long as you do not intentionally mislead/lie about seeing her only: it is your call. Experiment with the timing for yourself since every situation is nuanced.	I see people saying on here to put it out immediately, I disagree. If you like her and want to date, cut everything else out and she never has to know. If you aren't serious about dating her put it out there after a first date and don't mention banging other people.
What is your worst bathroom experience ever?	I skipped to the TLDR and saw wasp and was scared you pooped out a wasp. Idk why that's where my mind went but I'm glad it wasn't that bad for ya.	Coachella 2013. Sat in a rancid, humid porto john full of 3 day old hot stew. I was constipated as fuck and my friends were yelling at me to hurry up because the set we wanted to see was starting soon. So I pushed as hard as I could and I managed to pass a giant dump, but I also gave myself a bloody nose which was too much to handle between the smell and the heat, so I started vomiting.
For what reason do you believe that anyone would date you?	I have a high sex drive and like to be sexually adventurous. I care for my SO's problems and am tentative to relationship problems. I always like having a good time and am open minded.	I asked my girlfriend what she liked about me that made me worth dating. She said, and I quote: "You're nice, talented, funny, and honestly I actually liked you before you asked me out!" She went into depth about her crush on me, too. She told me the crush started "like a month before we actually started talking!". I was completely oblivious to her crush. In fact, I was telling her early in our friendship how oblivious I can be... she remembers that and she said to herself "You have no idea, lol". She also told me, and I quote: "I hated it when you didn't walk/scoot from jazz to marching band with me!" (For a while I rode a kick-scooter everywhere). She's my awkward little sweetheart and I love her so much ❤
What was your worst first date like?	I saw one on another worst date thread but this guy was driving the girl home after the date and she says ooooo what's this proceds to pull emergency brake on the freeway.	Ran into my old grade school crush when we both attended the same college. Turns out she'd had a crush on me in grade school too. First date we were going to the mall to see a movie and do some shopping. Something came up and we had to skip the movie. Then we bought baby mice to feed her snakes, which was kind of weird. We went back to my place, made out for a bit, but she had to run home before her mice thawed out. And then, she ghosted on me. Which was pretty hard considering we had classes in the same building and she lived two houses down from my parents.
What's the shittiest and most unthoughtful gift you ever received from an SO?	A backpack with colored pencils full of various office/school organizing things. It was awful but I plastered a shit-eating grin on my face and pretended it was exactly what I had needed.	Ex wife (wife at the time)modeled some lingerie for me. Found out later she had let her boyfriend fuck her in them and made a video of them fucking before she let me see her in them.
Lads, which of your jokes are you still riding the high from years later?	In high school, I had an art class where I sat at a table with this girl named Alexis. It was only us two at the table, so we had the whole class period to flirt with each other. She asked if I had a girlfriend. I answered "no". She said "Oh, so do you just have hoes?" I responded, "Something like that." "What's one of your hoes' names?" "Alexis." EDIT: Nothing spectacular happened. She just smiled and we talked about something else.	Sort of the opposite, someone made a joke to me so good that it stabbed my very soul. Someone once told me that I could make love to a cheerio and not break it. Still hurts.
Guys who married their first and only sexual partner, do you ever feel like you missed out on the "bachelor" life and if so, have you ever expressed these thoughts to your partner? How did they react?	All these people that say "the thought has never even crossed my mind" are so full of shit it makes me sad. Stop lying to yourself. It's completely normal and IMO a byproduct of evolutionary biology	My wife and I have only been with each other (she was also my first kiss), and I can only speak for myself but I 0 % feel like I'm missing out on anything. We have a great sex life, and I wouldn't change a thing between us - why would I look back at what could have been? No sense in eyeballing the Miata next to you when you're driving a BMW
What is your thought process when seeing a picture of an attractive naked woman?	I would tell her that she doesn't have to do this, that she's better than this, tell her to put some sweatpants and one of my old shirts on and that we can talk about who hurt her. I call this the Drake approach.	Well that *is* a nice pussy. I don't really have a thought process. I think my mind goes primitive because there's never any speaking going on in there. It's just like... I really like that, she's cute, I'd fuck her, but without words and all at the same time in my mind.
What's the boldest sexual advance someone made on you and how did it work out?	I went to her house for dinner and she made a large pot of soup and gave me a bowl. I start eating it and I notice there's a hair in the soup so I pull it out of my mouth trying not to make a big deal out of it, and she say's "oh you found the hair?" I said, "Yeah, why's it in there." She goes, "It's one of my pubic hairs, I really like you Dennis." I thought, damn I never even thought of her romantically, but it was such a creative way to ask me out that I just had to say yes! Thought this thread was missing a wholesome story, so there you go. We're still together and this week is our 4 year anniversary!	It was New Year’s Eve and my gf and I were out at a nice lounge downtown. I was coming out of the bathroom as someone was coming in. They looked me up and down, smiled and winked, then nodded towards the empty bathroom with a raised eyebrow. It was a pretty clear invitation for an anonymous quickie. Unfortunately it was a dude. He looked handsome and sharp, and I was flattered, but very politely motioned back towards my gf sitting at the bar to let him know I was taken... and straight. He nodded with a smile and we went about our evening. The whole exchange was silent, but we understood each other perfectly.
My girlfriend seems embarrassed when I pay attention to her not-flat stomach, but i like it exactly the way it stands. What to do?	Yes tell her that definitely and often. It most likely won't change her own dislike of it but it will absolutely be great for her self esteem simply knowing and being told of your love and admiration despite her own perceived "flaws"	Like other comments, I also recommend just plainly telling her how you feel about it. However, unlike them I neither expect her to change her view nor judge you if you no longer find her attractive. You like what you like, and she probably dislikes it for reasons other than attracting you. This may just be a sticking point for you two, but unless this is the subject of major complexes you will be happier for getting it off of your chest, and she will feel a bit more at ease in bed knowing at least you like it.
What is something your SO does that makes you feel “Manly”?	My boyfriend is being laid off soon so I'll be the only breadwinner. (By may you meant stereotypical gender roles, right? Cuz I'm a lady.)	When we would both be laying down cuddling, she would have her leg draped over me, her head on my chest, and if I made a sudden movement like get up to use the restroom or get some water she'd pull me back in as if saying not to leave. I'd nudge her a bit and tell her what I was gonna do, and she'd say "ok, but come back to me" all in a sleepy tone! Instant heart melt!
What's your favourite Simpsons episode?	You all can shut the hell up cause it's the Michael Jackson episode. You remember what a huge feat that was at the time?	The episode about Lisa's first word. Great episode, great ending, when Homer says to Maggie "The sooner kids talk the sooner they talk back. I hope you never say a word." And Maggie takes out her pacifier and says her first and only word "Daddy". Gets me every single time. I love The Simpsons.
What is the worst first date you have ever been on or seen?	I took a girl out to a nice restaurant and she starts dropping F-bombs. Well, I cringe and politely ask her to watch her language because this wasn’t the time and place to use coarse language. She refrains from using F-bombs for a little while. Then our waiter comes to our table and asks if we’d like dessert. The dipshit waiter then proceeds to have a long enough conversation with the girl and I’m clearly getting irritated by it. He finally realizes that he’s not there to socialize and goes to get the dessert. Once again, she starts dropping F-bombs and when I raise the issue with her, she starts yelling that we’re never going to see these people again and that I shouldn’t even care. I was freaking embarrassed to say the least. Shockingly, that relationship did not last very long.	My friend was asked by a date (very early into said date) ‘Are you on your period? I have this strange talent where I can always smell when a girl is on her period’ She picked up her bag and left immediately.
What motivates you to go to the gym ?	Motivates me? You're doing it wrong. It's part of my routine. I made my decision to do it, planned how I was going to do it, and then stuck to my plan. Told myself I'd re-evaluate the plan after 6 months.	I want a nice body. I like being able to see the progress. I want to be bigger than I am right now.
Men of Reddit, what do you think about dating apps?	They suck. I’m just trying to have causal hookups (Bc woman are just as horny as men) and for some reason women won’t just come over and have sex with me? Maybe it’s broken idk /s	Awful, depressing, and demoralizing, but I don't go out and meet people in real life, so they're marginally better than nothing.
What has a woman/girl done that you've misinterpreted as being interested in you?	Floormate in college came over to my room almost every day to lay in my bed and cuddle. We never did anything beyond that, and before I could ask her out, she got with another guy.	When they would talk to me. Lmao. I'm in a long term relationship now with my girlfriend (3 years and counting). But PLENTY of times when I was single, especially when I was in college, I had such a lack of meaningful conversations with women that almost every time one of them talked to me with any sort of consistency, I took it as she had interest in me. 9 out of 10 times that wasn't the case.
If Cosmo was written by people who knew what the hell they were talking about, what would you see on a "Top 10 ways to turn on your man" list?	1. Be hot, get naked. 2. Be hot, get halfway naked. 3. Be hot, get deep cleavage. 4. Be hot.	Number one on the list: make your man feel desired sexually. The biggest mistake women make is not understanding that the reciprocation of sexual attraction and desire is a very important to a man's mental health and well being in a relationship. Tons of women want to feel sexy and desired and fail to do the same to their men. Many people fail to practice common courtesy by not treating their partner the way they want to be treated in a relationship.
How often do you think about fucking those around you?	I make this same fucking argument all the time here. FtM transgenders always report this once they start hormone replacement. Yet, everytime I say men and women are different, and that men have a MUCH higher sex drive than women I'm downvoted. To answer your question, yeah pretty much I do.	It happens very often, but it is a fleeting thought. For example, when I walk to work (I work in a city) I will see an attractive woman walking towards me. I will look at her, the thought of her as attractive, sexy, or bang-able passes through my mind, and then its gone. This will happen most times I see a woman, but its a fleeting thought, much like when you see a fancy car. You see it, acknowledge its nice, and then the thought is gone. Very very rarely does the thought progress beyond that or last more than a moment.
How old are you and what is the most important thing that you've learned so far about life?	Won't give out my exact age, but I'm older than the average redditor. The most important thing I've learned is how to manage finances. I come from lower middle class, so I suppose I started out a little better than most, but everything I've made I've made on my own. I've never been in more debt than I had the means to pay off (even if I lost my job). The couple jobs I've had paid only a little more than average, yet I was able to essentially retire before I was 30. I gave up most of my 20s to make a large enough nest egg to invest it and live off of it. For those interested I highly, highly recommend the book "The Millionaire Next Door".	19 The most important thing I've learned is that you shouldn't underestimate what you can get if you ask nicely.
If you're a guy who has kids but another man is raising them: how does it make you feel if/when they call him dad?	Not exactly what you are asking, but. I just got remarried and I have a three year old I split 50/50 with her mom. I'm "daddy", my ex is "mommy" and my wife was just "Kristi" when we started dating. Now we encourage her to say "momma kristi." Not Mommy, but my wife is just as involved as my ex in this girl's life now and we want her to look at her as a parent.	I'm actually cool with it. I've actually gotten to know the guy, we have a few things in common, we talk and get excited over a lot of the same things. So I'm okay if my son calls him "daddy". He calls me "daddy" too. Plus it's still funny to me if we're both at my ex's house and my son says "Daddy?" and we say "yes?" at the same time. I call it "parenting in stereo".
Do you take unattractive or average girls into consideration when you say women can get sex/dates easier than guys?	Unattractive, yes. Average, no. Askmen also seems to think that a woman's appearance is all she needs to get laid. From my experiences, that's not true.	Average girls can get easier sex/dates than average guys. I'd say that unnatractive guys *may* have a slight advantage over unnatractive girls but its very difficult for both sides
My dad wasn't around when I was growing up,what did you learn from your dad that you would pass on to someone like me?	How to build computers, tormenting knowledge, good language skills and a great choice in movies/books. Athletics or construction? Not his scene. Construction I learned at work and my Mom was always there for my athletics.	Always be presentable and take care of your reputation. You will be surprised how many opportunities will be opened or closed to you *AND* the ones you care about once people perceive/recognize the kind of person you are.
"Hot" guys: how often are you rejected? Is dating easy?	ITT: All the shallow implications of human beings the people who adhere to the social contract refuse to admit in public.	yes it's easy to date, i.e. finding someone that's physically attracted. But I'm still a piece of shit inside so being rejected, droped and flaked on is very common.
South Asian and East Asian men in western countries, how has your dating life been?	Not Asian, but I quite commonly see ugly Asian men dating very cute Asian women. At least here in the States, the Asian women tend to flock to their own ethnicity it seems.	South Asian living in America here. It's been awful. I wasn't allowed to date when I was younger so I guess I'm at the stage now where I still have no idea how to talk to girls... I try but never have success. I had self-esteem issues for a while but I'm fine now. I started lifting more and that helped. It helped my confidence anyway, not with girls lol. In fact, the only people that will compliment you if you start building muscle is other dudes. I will say this though. I swear I'm not trying to sound racist but the number of white women that find me creepy without me interacting with them is insane. Not a problem at all with non-white girls.
When did you first realize you were in love?	I can't say I ever was in love. First time I thought I was, proceeded to let myself be led on and used for money and bail outs for years. Never again.	Long long time ago............... 1971. I was 16, and had been hanging out with this pretty little hippie chick for about 6 months........I would walk down to meet her halfway when we got together. This certain summer day I saw her walking towards me at a distance, and I could not stop smiling, a silly grin so wide my I thought my face would split................:) It lasted the whole time she approached, grinning back at me. We've been married over 38 years.
Let’s say you are offered five million dollars (tax free) in exchange for never drinking alcohol again. What do you do in this situation?	I'd probably take the five million Most people drink alcohol BECAUSE they're stressed about shit (which usually money would solve). Not to mention that there are many other drugs out there that could be a better substitute such as weed	These types of questions are no brainers, every time. For $5 million tax free, there very little (if any) vice a person won’t give up.
Today, I'm moving in with my S.O. I'm nervous, since I've never done something like this. What are some essential tips you could share?	Don’t poop for the first few weeks, just hold it in until she is more accustomed to you. You don’t want to scare her off.	From what I have heard in counseling. You need to learn how to be separated together. Give the other person and give yourself some space, being with your partner is wonderful but every human needs some alone time from time to time.
Guys, what's something cool that you do for yourself on your birthday?	I eat rich chocolate cake covered in double cream with a nice beer to go with it- it's a rare treat and something I only allow myself on my birthday. Birthdays aren't inherently special but it#s not tricky to make them that way :)	I really don't give a shit about my birthday but if I did, I'd probably take the day off work, not put on pants, stay well away from any type of productive activity, and spend the day drinking, napping, and playing video games.
Is it appropriate for a girl to get upset or angry when a guy cancels a date the day of, via text, only after a girl asks if their plans are still on?	Shit comes up. In addition, girls do this all the time. It's some stupid cosmo like shit test. They blow you off and see how you react. The blow-off is like a mini-date.	Unfortunately 'flaking' is very common in this dating climate. Being upset/angry is an understandable response, but ultimately it doesn't make sense to dwell on things that are out of your control.
Men who got their first relationship later in life... was it difficult to adjust your lifestyle?	Met my so at 19. She was/is my first. We are at around 5 years. I am still having to adjust shit. But it's worth it because I love her.	Communicate. By that I don't mean "talk for extended hours over the phone and text" but, tell her how you feel. Explain to her how this is all very new for you and how, despite you liking her a lot and enjoy her company, you may still need some time to yourself at times. One of the worst mistakes new couples make is burning too bright for too long too soon.
Who is the "village idiot" at your workplace, and why?	For once in my life, I am at a job where everyone from the Executive Director down to myself (the lowly office administrator), is treated with the same respect. We are an office of all women, with the one token dude, and it is a respectful, caring, fun, environment. We lift each other up, and try and support each other as best as we can. We have high stress work, so being able to vent to eachother, and to say "what the f@#$!" (My ED's favorite phrase she taught us), without fear of retribution, or judgement is wonderful. Every single day my job does not feel like work. I am truly blessed! *edit for spelling	I work with someone who is completely helpless with technology. They have, on multiple occasions, forgotten how to copy/paste text on the computer. They've had to be taught multiple times where the minimize button is on a program. They've mistaken Internet Explorer for Windows Explorer for two years, and they've assumed that by turning their monitor off that they're rebooting their computer. My company is developing an instrument & software for the medical field. We use this person to "idiot-proof" every single thing - software updates, new lab procedures, documents, etc. There are dozens of changes and upgrades we've made simply because this person found new ways to be incompetent. In some ways, I suppose that makes the village idiot useful.
Going to be having a girl over for the first time in nearly a year. Any prep tips?	Vacuum your floor. People walking around barefoot will feel every crumb and peice of plastic on the floor. Oh, and tampons too.	Tidy the place, fresh bed sheets, baby wipes in the bathroom, cut and file your finger nails and get some snacks/drinks. Just relax and enjoy yourselves.
Has someone ever purposefully broken up with their SO to be with you? What's your story?	I left my wife of 3 years for a woman who was engaged for 2 years. We worked together and started a friendship before we knew it we were emotionally cheating. We were both unhappy in our relationships so we left out SO's and hooked up. It's been 7 months and I couldn't be happier.	Yes, my ex told me that she dumped her boyfriend to be with me a few months after we were together. Then she did the same thing to me eventually. She then had a child with the guy and then he cheated on her and they got divorced. She then contacted me when she heard I was getting married and wanted to get back together. I said no way.
Heterosexual guys, how does it feel when your gf falls asleep on your chest?	I dont know ive nevwr had an girlfriend. The one time a girl i loved was laying against me and holding my arm was really fucking good bur thats all xd	It's cute but I like shifting around before I settle down to sleep. It's like a dog falling sleep on you, it's an honor but you can't move
What's the worst experience you have had with a girl which you were NOT dating?	Lost my hard-on in the middle of the act with this girl. Why? Because I undid her bra and her breasts fell out like water balloons. Poor girl was really attractive but hard the worst rack I'd ever seen. :(	Two girls at a bar I don't frequent got VERY mad at me for not wanting to talk to them after I sat down a ordered a beer. To be clear, I sat down, got a beer after a few minutes of waiting, and they started to be rude after 1 minute of small talk (didn't want to talk because of being tired after a long day). Still confused about it.
How do you react to your SO being catcalled in your presence?	Who cares? It's not like him saying something is going to woo your girlfriend. You ignore it. Entertaining it only benefits him.	Usually make a joke. One guy yelled "hey come hang out with us baby!" So I yelled "sorry hun, I'm flattered but I'm busy". They left us alone, I laughed, she laughed. It was all good.
Men of Reddit, did you ever hit a woman?	I'm not a man, but I've been hit by a man before. I was out clubbing with friends and someone accidentally pushed me forward (it was packed in the club and I'm tiny so naturally I went flying) into the back of this guy's friend and made her spill her drink. Then the guy turned around and started yelling at me so naturally I tried to walk away and I felt his fist collide with the back of my head and found myself on the floor again. It probably would have hurt more if I'd been sober.	Oh yeah, my sister and I used to beat the shit out of each other. She split my whole fucking head open one time with a fisher price xylophone, and I retaliated with a grand slam upside her dome with a wiffle ball bat.
If your wife/gf cheated on you with another woman, would it bother you the same as if she cheated on you with a man?	cheating is cheating. It annoys me to no end when bisexual women use the "it was with a woman so it's okay" defense to justify cheating. I know it's not fair to the millions of faithful bisexual women out there but it's happened enough time that I try to avoid dating bi woman	I believe the reason this phenomena exists is because if she cheats on you with another man, you can make a direct comparison between him and yourself and that leads to thoughts of inadequacy. Essentially, what's he got that I don't? With a woman though, you can't make that direct comparison. What's she got that you don't? Well tits and a vagina for one. The sex she has with your SO isn't the same as the sex you have with her, the things your SO finds attractive about her are likely not things she's looking for in you. Because it's apples and oranges, the tastiness of your apple isn't called into question.
How important is a girl's hair in terms of their attractiveness?	Very. Women tend to have longer necks and short hairstyles make them look like giraffes. 😆 Shoulder length at the shortest and I find long hair to be very feminine and sexy. In a rare issue if she doesn't have any or it's short b/c of sickness or injury that's fine. Looking like a boy with a man-cut is not attractive.	You think it's not important until you see a girl with a terrible haircut. Same goes for guys often. But a bit more for girls. Healthy hair is #1, and then a good style can make a girl go from pretty to beautiful.
Do you sometimes feel as though your looks don't accurately reflect who you are deep down?	Outside: Resting bitching face. Inside: Funny scenarios and one-liners are going on along with a myriad of LSD/marijuana-esque state of mind. I'm so weird.	Im 6 foot 3 and 250 lbs and old as dirt (67). I was very fit except I had bad bones from years of prednisone for Crohns disease so I was always in pain and walked like I was drunk most of the time. I used to blow my sons minds by doing 50 pull ups in my gun belt or going sit up for sit up with my grandson, but don't ask me to walk anywhere! Oh well I got my new hip now and soon I get the next one and then I get metal knees! Grandpa 2.0
What was the "bruh..." moment when your friend said something stupid to a girl that made her lost interest in him?	Out at a bar one night when a friend, M, tells us that he's going to talk to the bartender. He doesn't usually do this but had some liquid courage. Asks for her number and if she'd like to hang out sometime when she's not working. She agrees and all of us are dumbfounded. He actually went though with it. Fast forward 3 or 4 days and we ask him if they ever hung out. M goes on to say that she asked if he'd like to go to another bar and hangout. He responded with "Nah, I don't go out." To this day I laugh at how beta the poor dude was.	Once in a bar I heard a guy tell a woman "You're hot, you know...if good looks were a washing machine, I would put a dirty load inside of you." Didn't work out for him.
Dad's of reddit, Were you prepared for what you witnessed in the delivery room when your child was born?	2 kids,.. not prepared for the first,.. tried not to be present for the second. its disgusting. love the kids, loved my then-wife, but just nasty.	My wife had a c-section, and no, I was not prepared to watch people open my wife up and a whole ton of blood to be everywhere. It was all mildly concerning, but I figured the doctors knew what they were doing.
Attractive men of AskMen, what are your biggest challenges with women, while single or in a relationship?	Attractive men are probably not lurking on a sub full of socially awkward, out of touch young men. Part of attractiveness is having a rich and fulfilling life. That probably includes activities. Outside.	When you ask if a guy is attractive, keep in mind 90% of guys who call themselves attractive aren't really that attractive, they just have a decent face and aren't fat. Their experience will differ completely from a guy with a body like the statue of David. The major difference I've noticed from personal experience pre-fitness and post-fitness, as well as talking to other guys who are actually in shape, is that women send signals much more clearly when you're in shape. They will either smile at you a lot, make excuses to talk to you, or flat out hit on you. Whereas as a normal 'attractive' guy without an impressive physique, you can get girls but you have to do the work.
I need a new hobby. Why is yours awesome?	Swing dance. It's lots of fun and a great creative outlet, plus it's inherently social, and the community is great, very diverse and welcoming. Great way to meet people and learn something that you can spend years and years improving and refining and experimenting with.	Weightlifting - I look and feel awesome, and it's taught me wonderful things about myself, my limits, and how to discipline my mind. Overwatch - Have you *played* this shit? It's amazing.
Men who are confronted with potential threats of violence routinely (security guards, police officers, bouncers, etc), what do's, don'ts and pieces of advice can you give for other men who find themselves facing similar threats?	Reveal peace, prepare for war. here's my go to sayings in confrontation "if you knew what could happen to you, you wouldn't be acting like this" "one of us is going to the hospital and one of us is going to jail, or we can both get home safe" Always put your hands out in a manor that says "im the defender" if anyone is ever recording you you'll always look like the defender	Step 1: Don't escalate. Step 2: If it becomes apparent that you're not going to be able to defuse the confrontation *act first, act fast, and act with authority*.
What does it mean when a man says "society views me as expendable"?	Genital mutilation. Couple girls start having it done in countries halfway across the world and there is a global call for action. Nearly all men had their genitals mutilated here in the US and no one cares that it was done without our consent.	Well, for one, all those god damn "Let's end Women's cancer!" banners plastered all over the walls every time I go in for chemo. What am I, chopped liver?
Have you ever been involved with someone who was way out of your league?	I almost was. Then she flaked twice on dates and proceeded to make fun of me about asking her on a date. She was an incredibly smart and gorgeous woman however. Way out of my league. At least now I know my place.	I had thought so. I dated her for a few weeks and she was amazing--couldn't get enough of me, was a freak in bed, wanted to start introducing me to her friends, etc. Then something changed, she got cold and bailed. I was totally smitten with her for those few weeks. She was super hot, funny, seemingly really sweet, but was pretty mean and awful after leading me on fairly hard. Point is, people aren't always what they seem. "Your league" is a stupid gauge, and should only be measured by people who are worth your time. Many of those people will most likely be hot, and you'll be fine.
What Is Something You Do That Is Considered Feminine But Do Because It Makes More Sense?	Treating women like they're ormal human beings... Also I'll pee sitting down at home too sometimes, it's about the only way you can really do it with morning wood	I go for a good mani/pedi and let them put clear polish on my nails. My feat are banged up from Army and before that, 15 years of football. I had some major ingrown toenails and crap. I took my wife to get her nails done, and the lady at the shop encouraged me to get mine done too. She basically was a godsend.
What's something you feel strongly about, that you think no one really understands?	My intolerance to drama and those that cause it. I can't stand it and so far it has caused me to stop talking to certain family members and completely dismissed my desire to have a female in my life. My quality of life continues to go up the more people I cut out of it that cause me emotional pain. Selfish, stubborn, whatever it's called, I like my life more now than I ever have. Even with all the illness that has been coming up.	How much I can second guess myself and think I am a complete shitbag. Many times I hate myself for tiny, near insignificant things I do. I tell my friends sorry for things I did that I feel were mean or embarrassing, and they don't even remember it.
Why do I become overly attached girls?	>I got out of a 3 month relationship That's a relationship in high school, not for grown ups. I think it's reasonable to still not be labeled bf/gf at 3 months. >I was completely inlove with her I doubt it. It sounds like your just experiencing some immature feelings of infatuation. Enjoy it before you get too old and jaded.	Get a hobby. I go to the gym, travel, read, write, watch interesting movies, explore my city, hang out with friends,... I don't have time to obsess over girls !
What quality about yourself annoys you the most?	One of them I have been contemplating lately: When people make uninformed, unintelligent comments which have a flair of over-generalization, stereotyping, racism, prejudice, sexism, etc., I typically address it and use data and facts to educate the individual. I never do this in an aggressive manner - I see it as more of an opportunity to educate; however, I am sure this has caused negative impact on networking opportunities, job-related junk, etc. /grumble	I'm not a good listener. In recent years I've really tried to improve on that, but I still find myself cutting people off in conversation sometimes, or not fully taking in what someone is saying. I also come across as a cold/distant person. I won't respond to messages half the time. I'm amazed my friends still bother with me.
Guys who need a lot of space in relationships, how do you typically deal with a girlfriend who wants to spend more time with you?	Sidestep the attempt if I'm not about it -> radio silence -> done. Don't press me on shit either, that gets you a hard next. Let things happen organically, and if you can't vibe with me off jump and feel things out I'll find someone who can. It's all a numbers game, why waste time on incompatibility.	I recently broke up with my girlfriend because of this. I need my alone time, and everytime I said I needed some time alone, even if it was *literally* just a couple of hours, she's get super upset and next time there was an argument, she'd always bring up "You don't even want to spend time with me!" or a variation thereof... In hindsight, it's a miracle that relationship even lasted as long as it did...
Men who have been baby trapped by women how do you handle the situation?	Trapped meaning you are half responsible for the creation of a person and now have to co parent or financially support the dude?	When I busted my ex cheating (again), and broke up with her, I saw this desperation in her eyes, and they darted around the room as she thought for a solution. Suddenly she looked up at me and said, "Let's get married, let's have a baby" with a look on her face as if she had solved the problem of me getting rid of her. When she said that, an image of me in a cage popped into my head. I didn't think about it, it popped in as soon as she said it. Conversation was over, I told her to leave.
What is the most surprising, funniest, or otherwise remarkable confession you have heard from a drunk girl?	"You're so cute!" "Omg, where have you been!" (when i showed up a little late) "You want a drink?!" "I love you!" All from the same girl in the same night, while we were out with her boyfriend. I've avoided her since; but I would absolutely love take her for a night.	She said she wasn't on birth control, but also hasn't had her period in over a year because she's dead inside.
Fellow men, are there any "yes" answers to asking a lady out that just sour you instantly on the date?	Sure, but I need to be home by ten so I can wake up early for Church in the morning.	"Yes, my boyfriend is out of town/working/going out with his friends so that's perfect." " Yes, I'm still living with my ex so he can watch our son/daughter." Either way, run, do not walk, to the nearest exit.
How does one realistically date someone who's way more attractive than they themselves are?	I think sexual marketplace value absolutely exists. But I also think a person can change their SMV. How does a 6 land a 9? Well first off there's a great compatibility between 6s and 9s due to their complementary orientation but I digress. The way a 6 lands a 9 is he improves himself to the point where he's a 9 himself.	Looks are important, anyone who denies it is an idiot, however it's your personality; hobbies; confidence etc. that will keep you together in the long run. All those can make up for your looks, however this only works to an extent. Good personalities, confidence and being interesting won't help if you're 300 lbs and don't shower.
If your SO goes away internationally for a holiday without you, how often would you ideally like to communicate with them while away, and would you be interested to see look through all their photos when they return?	On vacation without me? Woman traveling by herself? Nah... Not happening. That's a recipe for, “it was in another country so it doesn't count"	It'd be nice if my wife sent a little something every day, just so I know she wasn't Taken 3 Don't want her glued to the phone by any means though
How do you gain control over your emotions?	Don't talk about them! That's it. Just don't vocalize them to other people. Easiest way to put it? Tought it up dude!	Meditation helps a lot. Try sitting for 5 minutes at first and go longer as you build up practice. Headspace has a great app and has 10 free 10 minute meditations to begin. It helped me immeasurably and I eventually bought a year membership. Cant recommend it enough. /r/Meditation if interested....
What do you think is men's number 1 issue that should be adressed?	I'm not trying to hate on women, it men's rights need to be addressed. Women everywhere are wanting equality and think women are being oppressed, but completely ignore it if it's a man being oppressed. If a man complained about the things women and feminists complain about, they would never be taken seriously. If women complain about it, BuzzFeed makes another fucking article explaining why men are such assholes that need to be stopped immediately.	Mental health, probably. Men are 3.5x as likely as women to fucking kill themselves. That's a bit of a problem.
What is an advice you would have given to your 18yr old self?	Stop being nice to girls and treating them with respect. That's not what they want to begin with, and the ones that are actually worth the effort are few and far between.	"Lose the bitch you're with and take this list of girls you're too stupid to realize are into you. They tell you as much later in life. Now go."
What is the best experience you have had in your life so far?	Honestly? Not a single event in my life stands out. I've been largely unhappy my entire life. I've fought suicide and depression for my entire conscious life. I'm unhappy and miserable, to be honest. I don't have a "best experience". My best experience will be when I finally die and I can be done with this shit life and shit existence.	Back in high school, me and my friends wandered off during a school trip, we were supposed to stay in a museum, but for a few hours we went exploring, it was the first time I felt overwhelmed in a big city and the feeling of doing something wrong, while having fun with my friends and looking at all those massive buildings gave me a satisfaction I never felt before. The rest of the trip was epic as well, at the end of it when we were back at the bus, my best friend back then said to me ''You know, at the end of every day in my life I feel like I had one day less, but today it felt like I gained a day.''
What is the worst pain you've ever experienced?	The hangover afer NYE 2014, or the last time I drank. You may scoff at me for comparing a hangover to your kidney stone or open fracture, but 99% of you world be dead if you did what I did on NYE 2014.	A kidney stone, I woke up at 3 o'clock in the morning in a cold sweat feeling like my guts were exploding and I couldn't tell which end it was going to come out of. I spent the next several hours alternating between sitting on the toilet and laying beside it on the cool bathroom floor, most of time with tears streaming down my face.
How do YOU cope with your loneliness?	I go out and talk to people. EDIT: drugs and jerking off is not coping, it's self-medication that does nothing to reduce loneliness. Why are we getting these pathetic r/foreveralone type questions here in r/askmen?? I get incredibly lonely sometimes and depressed. But I do something about it. If I'm not up to talking to people, I at least go to a public place where I will see people. I go visit my parents. I talk to someone somehow. The fear of rejection will only get larger if I continue to isolate. Interacting with people will only get easier if I continue talking to people.	I lay in bed. That's it. The only things that get me out of the house are my job, grocery shopping, and going to the gym. Depression is a bitch, especially having to go it alone.
What changes instantly as soon as you get married?	Your ability to call things off with minimal fall out if you get to a point where you don't want to be with her anymore.	Your relationship is suddenly much more respected by the general public, customer service, etc. Saying "I need to check with my wife first" has much more gravitas than "I need to check with my girlfriend".
What is your advice for two lesbians about to look after a 14yr old boy who has no real male role model?	a. Random boners happen. b. If you're attractive, he will masturbate while thinking of you. c. Make sure to teach him how to treat others, particularly women. Talk to him about girls, and how he should be honest with them and treat them like people - not just stuff to jerk off thinking about, and objects to have sex with. d. Remind him that strength isn't being loud and picking fights, its not having to.	DO NOT SHAME/MAKE FUN OF HIM IF HE MENTIONS A GIRL. PLEASE. Don't take and use information like that, even if you just think it's silly and funny. Makes the kid self-conscious and he'll just stop telling you stuff. Seriously. Can't tell how many times I told my mom "Hanging out with (female friend), be back later" and had them make 'silly' comments for weeks afterwards. Let him have his privacy. If he wants you to know about it, he'll TELL YOU.
Compliments for Men?	For me, I do not need women telling me how attractive I am; it is a turn off. It does nothing to me for a woman to tell me that she is attracted to me because of my appearance. Saying something like "I am happy being here with you." or "You make me feel warm and fuzzy inside" makes me much happier than talking about superficial things like my appearance. I much prefer actions over words though. Show me that you are interested in me. Walk up behind me and brush your body against mine in public. Hold hands with me while we stand in line at the restaurant or while driving in the car. Touch my face or my body. For what it is worth, guys do get hit on by girls a lot. Women can be pretty fucking aggressive.	the only one i remember, and that mattered, was when i came out of the shower in a towel and was walking past the g/f: she said, 'whoa, hold on a second.' i'm like, 'what?' she replied, 'i just wanted to get a good look.' it was just really honest and spontaneous.
As far as looks are concerned, what are your deal breakers?	Tattoos Lesbian hair cut Not thin, slim, or toned Piercings outside the ear lobe Orangish brown skin from sun tanning abuse Edit: Funny how my preference for a conservative woman is wrong.	Obese. I'm fine with chubby or even a little fat, I'm no model of health either. But I do try to take care of myself and be healthy, and someone who just doesnt care and is obese, I just cant do that.
How can I help my boyfriend through his body image issues?	Tell him to man the fuck up and keep pumping. He already started working out which is the most important step. Tell him to not look at the mirror/scale but in weekly or by monthly intervals Praise him when you start seeing that his body is actually changing Help him with improving the diet as that will have the largest impact on his routine.	He will only enjoy it by results. Small compliments like "Hmm, you are starting to slim down a little" go a long way. Do stuff like this randomly and not commonly or it will lose value.
What's a life lesson you learned that only experience can teach?	Women are capable of affectionate love (for their children), erotic love (sexual fulfilment), and self love (narcism... instagram, etc). However Women are incapable of selfless love. Women love men for what they do, or what their status provides. Women want security. If a man provides that then she will respect him/but she will never "freely/unconditionally love" him. Edit: Lots of down votes on this. Honestly this only applies to heterosexual men. It is a life lesson you can learn only through that experience.	When your gut is telling you that someone is not genuine or honest, and the red flags are there, trust it and move on.
What does sex feel like to you?	Feels an awful lot like my dick is in a slightly slimy hole. No emotional feelings unless I'm drunk. Sober= holy shit this is boring, I could be doing something more fun. Drunk = holy shit, this isokay, I guess I'll play along and try to have fun.\	Like that feeling when after a long day of work you take your shoes off, while taking a much needed piss, while drinking water when super thirsty, while finally scratching an itch, while eating a delicious medium rare, ribeye steak, while winning at Dark Souls, while getting my paycheck, while my dog is playing with me, while my penis is in a vagina.
Is it rude to tell Indian co-worker that he smells very bad? He's a cool dude but it's soooo bad! How do I convey it delicately?	What does being Indian have to do with how he smells? I'm not being antagonistic -- I want to know if you're specifically concerned about his reaction because of cultural differences.	You don't. You go to hr and have them do it. It's not your job, and most jobs have grooming standards.
Guys, what is your degree and how much money do you make anually?	High school. 50k. Sauce boss. I make sauces and salad dressings. Plan on going back to school, and or pursuing photography more seriously.	Majored in business ethics. I am a male stripper. $55k, but its a cash business so if you are the IRS $40k. Thank god for wealthy cougars.
What's the best decision you've made in the last 30 days?	I agreed to participate in bodybuilding competition with my brother for next summer and the SO is down to go through the experience with me. Works out (pun unintended) because SO and I are planning to be a bit more fit for our halloween costumes, since it's bulking time it works out with the holiday feasting, and then by next summer we'll have beach bodies. Plus, it's actually giving me a goal to work towards in the gym instead of the usual lifts and cardio that I normally do just to stay in shape.	Ended things with an Ex of 2 years. She contracted HSV-2 while we were getting back together, slept with me, blamed me for giving it to her, told her family, emotionally manipulated me to stay with her, then told me she'd commit suicide if we didn't get back together. Tested negative, cut her out and blocked her from social media and ignored calls. Told her mother of her contemplating self harm. Talking to a much nicer, less scarier girl. I'm so happy and as are my friends who saw this a mile away. Definitely dodged a bullet.
How many of you laugh at your own jokes?	I do. It's kind of hard though, because my jokes are so ~~God awful~~ intellectually complex that I usually have to explain them 2+ times.	I'm fucking hilarious so I laugh at everything I say. EDIT: Dear god, 9 days after posting this and I've received my first Gold! I'd like to thank my Reddit mom, /u/ffreudiannipss for getting me to this point and to /u/ohnoimrunningoutofsp who gifted me this on a nondescript Saturday while I enjoy the White House correspondents dinner.
My 14 year old brother is really perverted and inappropriate. Any advice on how I can let him know certain things are not okay to say?	Sounds like he was sexually abused. Hyper-sexuality in a child that age can be a sign of a much bigger problem. I would get him to a professional for help even if this isn't the case. This isn't normal 14 year old boy behavior, and he isn't going to grow out of it. Get him help.	Tell him that last sentence straight up. He's 14, he's not a little kid anymore. "Look, you keep talking about stupid shit like that I'm going to treat you like people do when you won't shut up about it. Hint: THEY DON'T HANG AROUND YOU." Also, tell your folks he's being inappropriate. They might have better chances straightening him out as they're already authority figures. Alternative: Start telling him about gross stuff to get the point across. "UGH. My flow was SO heavy this month it was like that one scene from The Shining with the elevator."
Askmen, how do you break out of the 'Nice Guy' routine? Is it wrong to be kind.. what is too much?	Try to always be aware of the difference between NICE and GOOD. Always be GOOD. "Nice" is when you buy a bowl of ice cream for a chubby girl. "Good" is when you buy her a bowl of lettuce salad. "Nice" is when you do her job/homework for her. "Good" is when you convince her to do it herself.	Imagine that you're a leader of a country: You have to be polite, gentle and kind, but disrespecting you is an affront to an entire nation and you simply cannot tolerate that.
What are your thoughts on a former fat girl?	> Would it change your opinion of her if you knew she used to be over weight? Yes > What are your general thoughts that run through your head when a girl tells you she used to be fat? How fat are we talking... Geez I better not invite her to dinner > Are you more or less attracted to her? That depends entirely on whether I was attracted to her before she told me she used to be a ham. > Or are you just indifferent about it? No madam. > I just lost a bunch of weight Good job.	Good for her, I was a fatty in high school. Probably the only difference is that I'd respect her work ethic a little more off the bat because I know what it takes. Other than that... nope, no difference. Edit - creeped on your progress pics, well done!
Men with little dating experience. How do I treat you?	Tease him like you would a little brother. Squeeze his muscles and make a pouty face. Give him titty twisters. Tell him not to be a pussy. Make him acutely aware of his lack of masculinity, but when he does something masculine you need to reward him by being subservient. If he gets all soft on you again, call him a pussy and refuse to talk about it and just keep moving the subject along. Ask him how much he can squat, how fast he can run a mile, etc and then say that you can do better. It sounds like his wife castrated him and he's forgot what it's like to be a man.	> My heart fucking sank when I read that message. It was just so transparent and... desperate? desperate? nah, he's probably had a number of girls he thought were into him just disappear. he's paranoid, and with good reason. I'd say be clear about your interest and affectionate if that's what you're feeling. if you want to end it, just let him know.
Where were you at the beginning of the decade, and where are you now?	At the beginning of the decade, I was a high school junior and turned 17 about two and a half weeks in. I am now a college graduate, with a BA in political science and currently in the process of applying for grad school online. I still live at home and don't have a job yet, but I'm OK with that. I don't want to spread myself any thinner than I have to at this moment in my life.	I was 10 living in my parent's house without a job Now I'm 20 living in my parent's house without a job
What makes a woman long-term potential?	* Well adjusted with no mental issues * high self-esteem/confidence * versatile & easy-going (can dress to the nines and go clubbing or stay in and watch Netflix) * intelligent without being either insecure about it or dumbing down her intelligence so guys like her * respects my independence/alone time and expects the same from me * can speak her mind, doesn't play games, and generally communicates like an adult * sense of humor * caring, kind, and empathetic towards others (you feel she would be a good mother) * ambitious and driven about whatever her passion is in life (having kids and being a housewife does not count) As you can see, it's not surprising that I am single. The above package might as well be a unicorn, but I guess I'm still holding out for something close.	At 30 years old and having had three serious long term relationships, I am pickier than ever. I really cannot think of anything that makes me want to "work" for a girl. The mere thought of having to "work" to get a girl is a huge turn-off. It’s impossible to neatly delineate what makes a girl long term potential, and it usually takes a while to figure that out. With my previous ex, I initially just wanted a casual arrangement, but after a few months she forced the issue. At that point, I had fallen for her and was ready to give it a go. Had she forced the issue earlier, I would probably have been outta there fast. Sexual attraction is a prerequisite for romantic attraction, and I certainly don’t want to make a girlfriend or wife out of someone I don’t want to fuck.
What software do you pay for?	OS media for Windows 7, 8 and 10. Office 365 though I won't be renewing any time soon. Computer games. Spotify.	Videogames, and Sandboxie. Very useful application if you don't trust a particular file/program. You can also set your browser to always run sandboxed. Something gets infected? No problem, it's contained in the Sandbox. Wipe it and the problem is gone. I don't pay for most other software though, I'm not going to pay $1000 for fucking Photoshop.
She got too drunk on our special evening - ok to feel pissed?	IMO, you do not have a right to be pissed. You can be disappointed and let down, but angry? Nah. People fuck up sometimes. If you were taking her out to dinner and it was purely altruistic, yeah. But you wanted some special sexytime, didnt get it, probably pouted and made things worse. When life throws you a curveball you gotta deal with it better.	This has happened with my wife and I a few times in the last.. Oh... Decades... In the moment, your only concern would be her welfare. In the morning, you talk about things. If she still thinks you're an asshole for taking care of her while sick, including leaving to get her a Gatorade, that's a problem in the relationship. You'll need to evaluate things. If she apologizes in the morning, post hangover, and seems remorseful, I'd just chalk it up to an accident. If it keeps happening, then you'll need to talk to her about her alcohol consumption, or reevaluate the relationship.
How has your perspective and expectation of women's bodies changed as you got older, if at all?	Not at all. Fitness is still the most important thing by far. If you start tolerating paunches and skinny fat as you get older, that turns into FUPAs and pig bellies soon enough, and you're a "shallow asshole" if you ask her to lose weight. Best just to find a parter who values being extremely fit in the first place	When I was way younger I was pretty into boobs. I feel like that has shifted over time and I'm much more of an ass man now.
How do you/would you deal with dating someone who loves you more than you love them?	leave them? why stay in a relationship that you *know* you're not feeling the best feelings for? don't stay with someone because **they** love **you**, stay with someone because **you** love **them** i do realize this leaves your SO in a shitty situation of "loving more than loved", and the same may happen to you later when you love someone more than they love you back. but thats how things go, you keep going until two people who both love each other equally are together.	Do not hide or fake feelings to be appeasing. Be direct and upfront. Enjoy the loves she expresses and show appreciation.
What skill are you surprised more women don't know how to do?	Play video games at esports level. Don't get me wrong, I've had my ass handed to me by plenty of women so they're certainly capable, but I'm surprised that the videogame scene is dominated by men seeing as it's one of the only "sports" that is theoretically gender neutral. Edit - why am I being down voted? It's a fact that they're underrepresented in esports.	Basic auto maintenance, or at least doing some research before allowing auto service shops to completely rake them over the coals with unnecessary repairs and service charges.
I just said “You too,” when the pizza delivery driver said “Enjoy your meal.” What’s the dumbest thing you’ve said because you didn’t think before you spoke?	I just said “You too,” when the pizza delivery driver said “Enjoy your meal.” What’s the dumbest thing you’ve said because you didn’t think before you spoke?	“Thank you” were my words of condolence to a parent that had lost a child in the funeral home receiving line. Not at all what I was trying to convey.
How to walk the fine line between waiting for sex until you're sure he's not playing you and avoiding alienating a guy who's genuinely interested?	If he's worthwhile and truly interested then he will be happy to wait until you are 100% comfortable, end of story. Another question might be, are you looking for a relationship with someone who will date other women and be a charming player type with them too?	I'll come at this from another angle: I've never known a man to tell me that he met an amazing, beautiful, considerate, sensible woman with a great personality and upstanding character - and they only stuck around to stick it in. My advice: focus on being the best you can be and providing the relationship the best you can offer. The rest will pan out however it was going to anyway. Plenty of guys sleep with women and then bail when they can't stand their character anymore. Be the chick that a guy wants to sleep with and then stick with afterwards because they're just so damn great.
Fucked up and told my kinda bf & co. that his dick is "perfectly average." What do I do?	Is it average? If so, you didn't fuck up, it was the truth. He knows his dick is average and shouldn't be sensitive about it.	Own up to it. Call him, say something like, "I'm a doofus. I totally did not mean to say that, it sounded better in my head. What can I do to make it up to you?"
What are your shallowest relationship dealbreakers (physical or personality)?	Physical-Overweight. Honestly it has never been about actually being overweight. Unless its a genetic disorder, it shows you have no self control and don’t give a shit about yourself. Personality-Relying on people to get you out of shit situations you got yourself in in the first place. Living your life like it’s a video game. Long story-Both attributes I mentioned show a huge lack of personal responsibility. Huge turn-off	My shallowest dealbreaker is when country music is their favorite music genre. I'm fine with old school country, but modern country music in my opinion is an abomination. Along with that, as someone who grew up in a really rural area (school closed for a week growing up during the county fair because 99% of the school was showing animals) anyone who grew up in a city and pretends they are so "country" drives me up the wall.
What was the straw that broke the camels back in your last relationship? What pushed you to end it?	She made lasagna with cottage cheese instead of ricotta. On purpose. To be fair, that camel didn't have a strong back to begin with.	The last one was when she went to South America for 6 weeks for a friend's wedding. I was invited, but due to work commitments and cost I couldn't really afford it. We'd been growing apart, and that I didn't really miss her when she was gone was telling, we were living separate lives, and not really what I wanted as I was approaching 30.
My loved girlfriend of 10 years died suddenly. I am totally wasted. How to cope with all this?	I call bullshit. This sounds like you just made this up. When I read the part about the cherry blossoms in Japan I just knew. Pretty cool you convinced all these suckers.	I can't even imagine the pain you must be going through right now and my sincere internet hugs to you. To answer your question, reddit is not the place where you'll find help with how to cope with this. Look for professional help, a good therapist will be able to help you get your life back on track. For now, just remember it's fine to feel terrible, she was a huge part of your life and don't let anyone decide when you're "over her death", you're the only one who can decide that.
How genuine/platonic are your friendships with females?	I know not everyone agrees. But, I don't think men and women can be friends. Most guys would have sex with their female friends if they were down imo.	There are girls I won't pursue just because I don't wanna fuck up the friendship dynamic, but unless she's ugly, there is no such thing as a female friend I wouldn't have sex with if she came on to me.
Men of Reddit, what do you think of shiny black leggings on women?	They are trashy, everyone commenting that they look good is just wanting to encourage women to wear leggings as pants so they can see ass better in public.	A girl at work wears these, An older lady complained that she was distracting the other male workers. I agree with her, it was distracting. But i'm not going to tell her she should wear something else. Because she looks hot in them.
What's something people say to make you feel better, but it only makes things worse?	Going out and meeting people or doing social things. Yeah just what I need, more vampires sucking the happy out of what little happy I have at the moment.	plenty of fish in the sea or something of the like after a break up....I don't want another fish. I had the fish I wanted.
Do you ever get romantically interested in a woman after you find out that she likes you?	i would think it depends on the guy.... most guys: "she likes me, quick see how fast i can get sex" other guys: "try and get her number, i love never getting a call back" me: "ok, whos playing a joke"	Definitely. The way it normally works is I see dozens of decent looking women every day and don't usually give it a whole lot of thought -- I mean, approaching every good looking girl I encounter would be a little absurd, and unless I'm just looking to hook up, I have no reason to believe most would be a good match anyway. If she expresses interest though, she's no longer some random girl; she's a girl who's interested, so now there's a reason to really stop and take notice. Doesn't mean I'm going to be into her, but I'll at least consider it, which is a big step.
What are some things you hate to see in women's dating profiles?	Guys, 'love to travel' is vaginese for 'I'm a golddigger/freeloader/leech/parasite. I don't have a career nor a decent job. Just gimme lots of money!' 'I'm stubborn/headstrong.' Yeh, be proud of the sucker you'll land. Bye now! 'Oh and guys that approach me, don't do sunglasses/sandals/motorbike, just a wink ugh... etc.' That's just fembragging meaning 'I'm so popular!'	I dont know if anyone else has noticed, but, I frequently see women bragging about how much of a bitch they are in their Tinder bios. Cant stand it.
What do you love most about your SO?	She respects me and doesn’t snipe me at every turn. I swear to god damn near every other relationship I see, nag, nag, nag... snipe, snipe, snipe... you married this person on purpose right?	She’s incredibly smart, emotionally intelligent, a great communicator and my kind of gorgeous. She wandered into my life when I was least expecting it and I’ve loved every minute of it.
How often do you hide your emotions?	I have a few habits that sort of combine into me appearing to bottle my emotions. First, I tend to try to focus on any positives of the situation. This is especially true when it comes to an action or reaction related to whatever is going on. Second, before/during that I usually try to gather as much information as possible to inform my reaction. So I go into a detective mode where I kind of detach from the situation and try to look at things objectively. Last, I usually don't feel the need to unburden myself on people unless I really feel I can't handle whatever is going on. I'll be completely open when asked about, but I don't offer anything up unsolicited. Those things lead a lot of people to feel like they need to pry emotions out of me.	If something is bothering me I usually don't tell anyone or just handle it myself. I don't like annoying/burdening people with my problems and would much rather not have people knowing unless they offer to help if they notice it's bothering me. "And know I pop bottles because I bottle my emotions." -Unknown Edit: yes I know these are drake lyrics. It's a joke.
Guys who worked very hard and made a lot of money, do you regret it? Guys who did something they enjoyed, but ultimately made no money, do you regret it?	If you have the ambition to sit at the top of the world, you'll know if you can happy making that minimum wage. Money won't make you happy, but you can't be happy without it.	I just left a job making ok money but with good quality of life for a job making great money and no quality of life. I would go back in a second, what's the point of having money if you're working all the time, can't take vacation, have no friends or relationships, and are stressed out all the time. That's not a life in my opinion. It seems like the people who enjoy that type of work environment are hiding from something. I'm probably quiting in the next couple of weeks. Sidenote: If you start missing a lot of events outside of work and seem miserable all the time, your phone will pretty quickly stop ringing. I'd rather be happy and live within my means.
How do you guys deal with feeling unwanted?	You have to learn to love yourself and enjoy time with yourself before anyone else will. Take yourself on a date go out to eat and to the movies	I still have no clue as to how to go around it. I'm the boy who nobody ever wants to pair up with science practicals. I was bullied and isolated extensively in primary school, and don't really have many people I can truly call friends. A handful at best. Never had a girlfriend either outside of two tries on an app, and am afraid I never will. I don't belong, wherever I go, and whatever I do. I'm OK with being on my own. It's how I grew up, and it's all I've ever known.
How do you convince someone they're attractive when they have zero self esteem?	Seeing that confidence is the most attractive trait in a guy...he's not attractive if he has zero self-esteem. You can convince him that he's attractive *to you* though.	Most likely they have zero self-esteem is because of their past experiences that reinforce the idea that they're ugly. The best way to counter this is to create new experiences with them that reinforce the idea that they're attractive. The more powerful the experience, the better. That's why actions are generally more powerful than words. When I was little my mom once told me that she wished that she married a white guy instead of my Asian dad and said that I was a disappointment because I reminded her of her Asian heritage. I repeat what she said to myself every night before bed. So yeah like I said, the more powerful the experience, the better.
What's the shortest amount of time you've spent at a job?	Donut shop. Two days. The donuts were free but we had to record every soda. Cups had bible verses written on them. Got a pamphlet about the founder going from being a homeless man to donut mogul by the grace of god. I left because my back started hurting from standing around all day. There were like 20 people on my shift, wasn't worried about it. No regrets. 19 year old atheist me needed something more interesting, easier on my weak lanky ass, and less preachy. edit: didn't read the whole question.	3 days. After watching the owner of the machine shop I got hired at berate an employee, I realized the owner doesn't care about his employees or even retaining good employees. So I quit.
Men who were falsely accused of something serious, what’s your story?	This dumbass who my then girlfriend and I were good friends with accused us of stealing his glasses. Its was such an obnoxious accusation that we went along with it and said of course we did and well put them on for sale if you wont show up to hang out with us tonight. He came Through that night and yelled at us until red to give his glasses back to him or hell call the cops. He left pissed and I hope that one day he found them and realized how fucking paranoid he decided to make himself look. That was the last time I saw him irl on facebook I kept seeing him poaching our friends	I can't speak for myself but I have a story of my stepfather. My mom started dating my stepfather when he was fighting a custody battle that went on and off for nearly a decade. A year into getting weekend visitation rights his ex accused him of molesting my stepsisters. We had visitations from CPS, the step girls were given rape kits, psycological evaluations and it even went to court. Even my sister and I were interviewed. I remember him coming home and just weeping and the deepest sobbing I've heard in my moms chest after a court meeting. All the accusations were false. The ex just wanted to keep collecting child support for her, later we found out, heroin addiction.
What do you wish women would just GET about men?	The the more sexual partners you have, the less desirable you are for long term relationships. I mean you know it too since you lie about your partner count.	That we're allowed to have insecurities and that doesn't make us bad people. No, I don't want to meet your exes. No, I don't want to think about your sexual history. Yes, it bothers me seeing facebook pictures of your past relationships. And no, these emotions don't make me misogynistic, controlling, immature, whatever. **Everyone** has insecurities, that's part of being human. I'm all for managing my insecurities in a healthy way, but it's wrong to shame me for having them in the first place.
What is your favorite way your SO shows you they love you, without saying "I love you"?	He asked me whether I wanted a piece of mango out his fruit shaker. I love mango so yes, obviously! I ate it and he said: "that was also the only piece of mango." I went kind of sad, "you should've said so" to which he replied "no, because then you wouldn't have taken it. But I also can't help saying it's the last piece because your reaction is so funny." He loves me. Big time. I mean, he not only gives me food, but even his only piece of something. On top of that, he knows me extremely well and loves to joke around with me. He also bought me a nutella crepe as a surprise once and only took one small bite himself on his way over to me. He's a keeper. <3 I mean... he's a guy and he gives me his food!	Gently cuddling with me and making out with me. My most cherished example is when she came over to my apartment when I was sick and stayed all weekend, taking care of me until I got better; all I did was to reply to a text saying I couldn't go out as I was not feeling well, and she showed up without me asking for help. This happened 7 months into our relationship; neither of my previous two gf's did anything like this in the combined 3.5 years of dating them.
Men of Reddit, how do you deal with anxiety affecting your sexual performance?	Get some Viagra, that will increase your confidence and then you shouldn't need it. Although if that doesn't work after a few times stop taking it cause you don't wanna get dependent on it.	Speak to her about it and take the pressure out of the situation. It happens to all of us, and the more you pressure yourself to get and stay hard, the harder it gets (= the softer your dick stays). What always helps me is going down on my girlfriend or me playing with her in a seemingly non-sexual situation.
Men with an unusual "type", what is it?	I kinda feel like I'm in the minority saying big tits are fucking gross and not even remotely attractive. There is nothing good about them.	I've always been a fan girls with saggy tits. Way back in the day, god this is going to sound so bad. My girlfriend at the time had a younger sister. We were over her place (the younger sister) because she just moved into a new apt and we were helping her move in. Well, she had just recently had a baby and she was talking about how her tits were saggy and she hated it. It was strange because she brought it up several times out of nowhere. And she said it like she was really mad. I remember thinking I wanted to ask her if I could see them just to see how saggy they really were. And I was so turned on by her just saying that. God I'm fucked up. No I didn't ask. I don't know why I'm telling this story.
Are you aware of your threat level?	I'm 6'3", covered in tattoos, hit the gym 5 days a week and alway have a mean mug on because while I have a bomb ass house, it is located sufficiently in the ghetto. I would rather not know how people perceive me. Especially when I'm open carrying my handgun. My guess is most people look at me as threat level black watch plaid.	I'm a tall lanky dude with Harry Potter glasses and a jewfro. People probably assume that a strong breeze could take me in a fight.
Those of you who use Tinder, and frequently go to her place to get to the point, how do you go about it?	Pick her up on the second date and do something that's at night time that involves a little bit of drinking. When you drop her off at the end of the night mention that you're tired and ask if she has any coffee or water inside. After that the rest is rather straight forward.	My comment is not about Tinder, or even relationships. If you continue the thought process of "should've achieved this by my age" it will destroy you. I did that to myself for most of my teens and into to my early 20s until I learned not to do that, but by then it had already done a lot of damage to my self worth and self image. Stop comparing yourself to other people, other people will always look better. Everyone progresses differently in life. Just because you're at a different place in life compared someone else at your age doesn't mean it's the wrong place, it's just means it's different. Different isn't bad. EDIT: grammar
Over at AskWomen, we get a lot of thinly veiled attempts to provide fetish material. Does that happen often in AskMen? And why or why not?	It seems like the /r/askmen crowd is more immature (I partly reach that conclusion based on comparing how interesting/original/serious questions are on /r/askwomen compared to /r/askmen) and welcomes such topics, often asking them to themselves. People here like talking about their fantasies, it seems. I don't think we get as many women fishing for fetish material for some reason, but I get the feeling that many wish we did, and that's why they just settle for making the lewd questions themselves. Edit: Heh, the reasonable replies to this comment have me somewhat changing my mind actually. Perhaps I was too harsh.	No. But we do get a lot of women fishing for compliments or trying to justify their lack of effort dating.
Men who haven't been in a relationship in a long time, do you feel uncompelled to remedy that?	So i'm a 58 year old guy who hasn't been laid in a couple of years. I am so over the drama women provide that a good wank every day or two beats the physical intimacy of being with a women. I know, it sounds weak. But in reality, I've learned how to give myself better orgasms than any woman could ever provide. I know how my body works and how the pain/pleasure center works. Intimately. So, no. I have no compelling reason to be in a relationship. Also, most of the women my age are unattractive/overweight/too much baggage and are totally unattractive.	I'm 34, and havn't had sex in 6 or 7 years. I'm currently trying to remedy the situation. I have a lot of great friends who want me to succeed, and I've been focusing one my health and goals to be a better person. I've actively been trying to go on dates. But I keep running into the same problems... Women just don't seem to find me attractive. I often feel humiliated by this. I try over and over, and I feel like I'm getting no where. It's a horrible feeling, and I want to stop feeling it. I'm not going to give up, but I always feel like I want to... I feel like a failure as a man and a human being. It's rough, but for whatever reason I keep trying.
What is it about women that baffles you the most (if anything)?	They spend hours every day trying to make themselves more attractive, and then get offended when you're attracted to them.	My mother always told me that it is impolite to go through a woman's bag. Every chick I ever dated asked me to go through her bag to find something. All these bitches trying to get me in trouble with my mom.
If you could magically look into the future and see that you were never going to find love. What would you change about your life?	To be honest, I'm not sure I'd believe him. I mean, I'm engaged to the woman of my dreams now, so I'm speaking hypothetically. But even in my decades as a lonely virgin with nothing too special about myself and zero prospects, I always just believed everyone finds love eventually.	Would changing anything change that outcome? If not, then I'd probably stop actively looking for a relationship but that's about all I would change.
How has your personal relationship with religion changed as you have aged?	Bought up low level Christian. Church happened but only on occasion. The more I looked at the bible as I got older the more I saw it as a terrible book. I guess I just drifted away from it. I'm not religious but don't like the smugness of the athiests either.	My parents can't make me go anymore. Never really believed as a kid and it didn't do a thing for me and am an open atheist now.
What was the hottest way you were surprised by your SO for sex?	I have two. 1) I came home from school late one night in December. She was on the bed dressed up as a sexy elf with candy cane thigh highs and red heels. 2) I got home from work and opened the door to her bending over cleaning the house in a sexy maid outfit and heels. We were expecting company within 15 minutes for a big party. They ended up waiting outside for a hour and a half until we were finished.	She had just gotten a Mirena and we had bareback sex for the first time. It was incredible. Anyway, at some point I was about to cum, and realized I hadn't asked yet, so I ask if she wants me to pull out. Y'know, to be on the safe side. She said no and pulled me closer. Wasn't expecting that, since we did have a pregnancy scare or two with condoms. Needless to say, I came seconds later.
How long would you wait for a date to show up?	I'm waiting five minutes before leaving, I value my time and don't like time wasters. If she is going to run a few minutes late I'm expecting a text on her end. Women who respect you will send a text if they're running a few minutes late. If she straight up flakes I treat it as a no call no show and move on completely. It's not worth being around a woman that doesn't respect your time. Plenty of other women out there who make things easy for you.	I always have first dates at a place where I can hang out at the bar until they show up and where I like the food. If they don't show in the first hour, I'll go ahead and order food, enjoy my meal and then roll out whenever I feel like after.
Anyone has that one friend who is a total slayer when it comes to women? What qualities you think make him stand out from the rest?	A lot of them are scumbags, in my observation. Or they just outright use their resources to get the punani.	I know a guy that gets with a lot of good looking girls and for a while, a mutual friend and I weren't sure why. He's reasonably handsome sure, but the girls he takes home we're far better looking than "reasonably" pretty. We attribute it to his charisma. He really listens when you talk to him and will ask questions. If you don't see him for a month or two, he'll still ask you about something you discussed the last time you spoke. On top of that he's relaxed in his own skin. I think all that makes him attractive to women and then when he sees girls that know him on nights out, he finds it relatively easy to go home with them.
Redditors who just ended a long term relationship, and redditors who just got into one after a long period of singleness, what was the most striking change for you?	My boyfriend of 6 months (not long term at all, but it was still significant) and I broke up almost 3 months ago. I think the hardest part was not hearing his voice anymore. Like clockwork, everyday when he'd get out of work he'd call me. We'd talk about our day while he was walking home from work, and those 20 minutes became the highlight of my day. Even if we didn't talk about anything in particular, it was nice having that little routine. I also recently got into the genre of music he loved, and it's hard not being about to text him about a cool song I heard.	Ended a 8 year relationship half a year ago. The thing that hit me the hardest is the lack of that someone you'd talk to and just hang around with when you get home after work. Coming home to an empty home after so much time together is really... odd. Still not used to it.
I need to know if my husband is being truthful-- how bad is the men's bathroom?	That's cute, he still thinks girls don't poop. Does OP really want to shatter the "sugar, spice and everything nice" fantasy?	Men's bathrooms are consistently ugly. They almost always smell like pee. They're often bordering on disgusting and it can feel like you can't touch anything aside yourself and be clean in there. Because of the urinal situation, you can openly witness poor hygiene regularly - people come in, pee, and leave with nary a drop of water splashed upon them. Women's bathrooms are usually better, but when something happens in there, holy shit. The stalls are often a disaster on their own. The kind of mess you want to set fire to and walk away; wholly inhospitable for human life. Source: I used to be a janitor.
What's the weirdest thing you dealt with when moving in with your SO?	I’ve liked with my wife since I was 16 (34 now) and can honestly say that there was never a thing that bothered me.	I was not prepared for how much hair I would find all over the house. On the floor, in the sink, on furniture, in the fridge, etc.
With which signs can you tell that someone has almost never been alone in their life?	The belief that you can just go out and "grab a girlfriend". Most often said from female friends who literally think that's the way it's done. Often followed by "No, you're cute! What me? Um, maybe if I wasn't dating (name changes weekly)"	"hey, what's for dinner?" I dunno dude, whatever you want to make for your damn self, I'm your roommate, not your mom.
Lenin is a game played by an adult and one or more kids. Lenin lays down on a bed and pretends to be a mummy, kids quietly serve as Guard of Honor at the entrance to the Mausoleum (bedroom). Fathers of Reddit, what games did you invent to get your kids to do something?	Weren't father and son but I watched this new kid getting ordered around to clean the car and paint the fence. He believed to learn Karate that way.	My dad had me play firefighter. Where his trees were on fire and I just watered them for him with a bucket and the stream...
What's your most recent FAIL with the opposite sex?	In an episode of autism, I went up to a girl at the library and said "will you out with me"? I have no idea why	In a club on Halloween. See a girl. Smile at her, she smiles back. Do nothing. She goes away to the bar never to be seen again. Our babies would have been beautiful god dammit.
What convinced you to stop wanting to get a girlfriend?	Freedom. The realization that literally every day there's a women turning 21 so why settle with just 1? What am I? A clown!? 🤡	I'm lazy and what little free time I have I don't feel like spending it with other people I just want to relax and enjoy my hobbies.
Is it really that rare to meet women who can make you laugh?	To those of you who say women aren't funny... You just haven't met me. I'm fucking hilarious. *True.* Incidentally I find it amusing that we toss out Tina Fey as an example to 'women are funny'. Do you dickheads socialize at all? Sure funny is rare but we're not talking white-whale rare.	It's more rare to find women that make me genuinely laugh. I meet plenty of women that make me chuckle or smile with a little joke, but making me bust out in my hardy laugh... well that is a bit more difficult.
How intensely do you feel emotions? Am I "insensitive"?	I think emotions are pretty important so you're missing out on something if you don't have them. Because men are discouraged from showing emotion I'm always a bit skeptical when a fellow dude says they can't feel emotion. Maybe they can but they've learned to turn it way down/ off, I think. Edit-- why am I down voted?	Not sure how "normal" it is, but I'm the exact same way. My parents will ask me how I feel when X is happening, or if I'm excited for X in the near future. I always tell them that I don't experience excitement the same way they do. Aunt dies, sister goes to a new country, meet my half-sister for the first time in my life. All are important events, and I recognize them as such, but they just don't register much of an emotional response from me.
FAQ: How do you flirt with a girl you want to hook up with vs. a girl you want to date? Is there a difference?	I tend to be more of myself when I'm flirting with a girl I want a relationship with, just because the possibility of her seeing through the confidence I've faked during the actual flirting during the relationship sounds scary. If sex is all I want, and if the thing is mutual, I'll let my fantasy go wild. Especially if I'll never see that girl again, I'll start coming up with cool shit about myself that aren't real just for fun.	In my opinion, I've noticed that I behave differently but this doesn't apply to all men. With a girl I want to hook up with I don't go out of my way to see her. I answer less often, I joke around about sex a lot. A girl I'm trying to date I'll be playful but respect boundaries until we cross them, I answer when I can, and I go out of my way to see them. Disclaimer This is probably why I am single
What is your weirdest dealbreaker?	If he doesn't like tofu. I'm pescatarian and I use tofu when preparing dishes that call for meat from land animals.	If you tell me you're good at Tekken and then pick Eddie when it comes down to proving it I will straight up turn my back on you. After I annihilate you.
My friend is dying of cancer (he's in his 30s) and I've only got a few more weeks/months left with him... If you were facing this situation, how would you spend the time you have left with your friend? What would you do, think, buy, spend, give, etc. with the short amount of time left?	I wouldn’t. He’s dying. Nothings changing that. Dying is easy. He’s going to be in turmoil until he dies but then he won’t feel anything. You however are always going to miss him. You are always going to hurt If it were me I would start distancing myself immediately and pretend he’s not dying.	Ask him. Ask him what you can do for his wife and kids. Ask him what you can promise him that will ease his mind.
Men who are now in great shape, what do you wish you knew when you first started?	Protein shakes and most supplement stuff is useless, save maybe Fish Oil. 200 mg of test will also make you feel like a champ and work as birth control as well.	That the routine is the hardest part, not the workout. The hardest part of a run is lacing up your shoes. Make it a priority and don’t let anyone get in the way of that and you’ll be shocked at how fit you get. Source: solid marathon, Ironman and adventure racing times.
Men of Reddit how do you really feel about giving your gf oral sex?	love doing it, but some vaginas are far more visually appealing than others. I don't know if others guys notice it but vaginas with a fuck ton of flap and skin aren't visually appealing to me at all.	Don't enjoy the act itself, but it makes her happy, so that makes me happy. I imagine a lot of women feel the same way. That said, the feeling of thighs around my head is absolutely divine.
You say something stupid to your SO, and she hits you. Your response?	My wife of 38 years weighs 101 lbs. I weigh 240. My wife worked in an office. I've been everything from a farm hand to longshoreman, to armed guard, to firearms instructor, to self defense instructor. Yes, she has struck me, and I deserved it. I laughed.	I am fascinated by these responses. I grew up with all types of media (movies, comics) depicting men being jerks, and the girl slapping them and walking away sassy, while the guy stood there and held his face, either in shock, or smirking because he succeeded in irritating the girl. This made it seem completely acceptable/normal. It wasn't considered abuse or assault because those things were only recognizable by black eyes, bruises, and the like. I think it is pretty awesome the guys are standing their ground. "if you love me/care about me, there is absolutely no reason to react in that way".
What was your "I can't believe that worked" moment when it comes to women?	High school gf broke up with me after our first semester of college. Panicking, calling, begging her not to leave; nothing worked. We met up on Christmas break back in our home state. Too tired and fed up trying, I walked out of her house and told her I didn’t give a shit anymore (I did). That momentary glimmer of alpha-independence literally had her sobbing on her floor holding my leg from me waling out the door. Why the fuck does it have to come to these psycho mind games?	After a party, everyone was leaving. Girl calls an Uber, I ask if I can ride share. She says “sure”, and we get in. She asked where I was going. “. Turns out she lives in the opposite direction to me. So I just said, “yours I guess”. She was like, “yer ok, sure”.
What's something about this community that you dislike?	That 20% if the responses are men and most are women answering for their man. If I wanted the woman’s opinion I would ask there dammit.	I don't like that most questions are related to women or relationships. The best questions and answers here usually don't have a lot to do with neither of those topics.
Has a woman you were seeing ever said something about you to your face that made you lose all interest?	I'm not a man, but I wanted to say that I once stopped talking to a guy because he told me he liked Nickelback.	Once a girl told me that she liked me having a kid because it kept me home every night and kept me from cheating. Lol. Edit: For those that were curious. This girl was a mutual friend on Facebook that I met at a birthday party. When she said this to me through text, my only response was "Lol". We hit it off at the party and I was disappointed to hear her say that afterwards.
Why is it considered shameful to visit prostitutes? Do you think this stigma is justified?	Because it is easy sex. Women don't like the price go vagina being reduced by prostitution, and men don't like the idea of other men getting easy sex with hot chicks while they have to work so hard for it. Notice that relatively low priced prostitution with attractive women is viewed the most negatively, while more expensive prostitution is more acceptable. People don't complain about $5000 methed-up legal hookers in Nevada who have to give half their earning to their pimp, oops, I mean brothel owner. They complain about $20 hookers.	It's seen as shameful because it's basically admitting: >"I can not find any women who want to have sex with me, so I have to pay someone to do it." It's similar (but more extreme) to the stigma that online dating has: >"I can not find any women who want to date me, so I have to go online to find someone willing." Dudes get judged on their ability to attract women and both of the above situations spell out that they're not able to.
How as your taste in women changed as you got older?	The older I get the more appealing are chubby women and the more appealing are huge butts and huge boobs. After being in a relationship for three years now, I also wouldn't ever want to date a girl who wasn't easy-going and accepting all my flaws. I always expected to have to hide a lot of my personality and sexuality when being in a relationship. I don't think I'd be willing to do that anymore nowadays.	I definitely stop trying to "save" my women. I used to be attracted to women who were in need of some kind of support. Now I want someone on the same level as myself.
Why do short guys think they have no hope with girls?	Because they're looking for something to blame their failure on other than their personality. If I get rejected because I'm a jerk, weird, creepy, an ass, a pervert, etc, that's something I can control. I'm a jerk. If I get rejected because I'm short, then it's out of my control, so SHE is the jerk.	Because being short *is* a disadvantage. Obviously you can compensate for it, as you have since you're handsome and fit, but in general, short is seen as less attractive than tall by most women. I disagree with the doom and gloom that short people on reddit like to peddle, but it's naive to think their doom and gloom is purely in their heads. It's an unfortunate response to an accurate assessment. The proper response is to do what it takes to improve your attractiveness, like getting fit, not lying down and dying. If a lot of girls aren't into short guys, they're even less into Debbie Downers that just give up.
Guys say they're attracted to a wide range of girls, but online a lot of guys are very harsh about women's bodies. What's the truth?	A lot of guys on the internet are very "soft" on women's bodys and will say almost every woman is hot.	A woman in a picture is *only* a picture. She's got nothing else; she doesn't move, she doesn't smell nice, she doesn't have a nice voice (or any voice), and she's not even 3-D: she's just a flat picture. So she had better look really, really good, because that's all she has. A woman in the same room as you has a whole bunch of assets that a woman in a picture doesn't have, and they can make her attractive in ways that wouldn't work if she was just a picture. When you ask online about some feature, people call up a picture in their heads, and then judge the picture. That's probably the source of the discrepancy you're seeing. Few women get work as underwear models. But most women find men who want to get horizontal.
Do you prefer lingerie to nudity? What would you think if a woman preferred to keep her lingerie on, during sex?	Lingerie basically does nothing for me. Once we get to the point of taking off our clothes, I'm ready to go. What, am I supposed to stop and just like... look at her or something? Bitch, take that uncomfortable shit off and come sit on my face. You got cumming to do.	Sex part definitely naked. Beforehand lingerie adds a certain mystery, even though you've seen the girl before. So imo lingerie is more of a turn on than just straight up naked. There will be sex either way though.
How do I cope with always being inferior to my best friend?	Yeah you're Swedish which means you're automatically better looking and smarter than most Americans. I have no sympathy for you	Start looking at the two of you as a team. Is the game attracting women? He's bringing attractive ladies into your circle; the team is winning. Is the game lifting? Y'all are both making gains and getting stronger; the team is winning. While "get over it" is technically the right answer, that's basically impossible. What you need to do is replace your jealousy with something else. Use positive self-affirmations: when you find yourself thinking envious thoughts, remind yourself that your team is winning; when you find yourself putting yourself in his shadow, remind yourself of your positive attributes. If you keep doing that, eventually you'll find it getting easier, and becoming your first thoughts instead of corrections.
What fitness level do you expect in your potential date, if you are very athletic yourself?	Is this a validation post? This smells like a validation post. I'm interested in non-overweight women who put effort into taking care of themselves; y'know, eating healthy, maybe going to the gym, at least jogging or some sort of regular physical activity. Women tend overestimate their own value/attractiveness, so I don't bother with super fit girls, since they tend to go for guys with physiques that require hormonal modifications that I'm not willing to undergo.	My ideal is that a potential SO is active in their own way. It doesn't have to be lifting weights or running (in fact, my gym time is valued alone time) - but I'd want them to be into something active; dance, gymnastics, hockey, hiking, fun runs, anything really. This, admittedly, is an ideal - not a requirement. It isn't so much that they need to be physically fit, but more that it'd make dating easier. It'd align our values and habits. They'd be more understanding why I don't drink much, eat a ton, enjoy early nights, and why I prefer to hike all day rather than go clubbing all night. That's just me though. I've never actually dated someone who was all that into fitness, and equally, I'm still attracted to those who aren't. So I wouldn't dwell on it.
Just found I'm pregnant to a guy I was seeing for a few months, I now live in a different country. Do I need to tell him in person?	I don't have much to add in general, but reddit's pregnancy community /r/BabyBumps is fantastic. Please check it out. Very awesome group of ladies (and gents!) with good advice, very little prejudices (some, but that's every group), and a great mix of lifestyles and backgrounds.	I literally got a map and compass out, calculated with a circle how far a fifteen hour flight would be from my location to if any of those countries matches my exes current location. I don't think it's you unless it was a really slow plane.
r/AskMen - Men who lost their sexual attraction to their SO... Why? Did you try to rekindle it, and did it work out? If not, what happened with your relationship?	Had 2 babies. Saw them both come out. Could never see 'it' the same way. My problem not hers but that's life.	My partner became too dependent on me. We lost our individuality. I really think sexual attraction stems from this idea of "separateness." When you first start dating, that person is still "other." You find them mysterious, independent, etc. But eventually you melt together into an unsexy blob. We're really intimate ALL the time, but never erotic. Trying to make it work currently. Trying to become two again, so we can enjoy becoming one. EDIT: wow thank you for the gold. I'm extremely honored.
Porno pet peeves / How can porn be improved?	I find most modern porn unnecessarily humanizes women and fails to properly out them in their place like the stupid little pieces of ass that they are. And stop coddling them, they aren't made of glass. I see DVDA and I'm like, pffft, cut the act sweetheart, you could totally fit another dick in there. Also, the dicks are too small. How am I supposed to imagine myself in there looking at this micropeen that could barely fill up a bread bag? It's not "deep throat" if you don't get acid burns on the tip, just sayin'. Sigh... It's reddit so I guess I better go ahead and ... /s.	Personally I would like more sensual blowjobs. Don't gag on that dick, worship it. Also, I would like things to be taken slower or at a more natural pace. Dave Jones does this really well. Also, also, I would like one damn MFF threesome where one of the woman is the focus and they get her off multiple times and then done. I don't know, I think this would be great.
What do you love about being a man?	Ok I didn't like growing up to be a man. But once society is done drilling us into be confident, strong, self-reliant, resourceful human beings, things are the shit. Women grow up sheltered and used to getting things for free. Men have had to work for everything all their lives. That pays off in the end.	My body is, comparatively at least, is low maintenance. The relationships females have with each other are way too political for me. The social aspect of being a man is also very low maintenance. TL;DR Being a man is low maintenance.
Men who are infertile, when did you find out, and how has it affected your life?	I am by choice. It's affected me mentally I suppose. Just knowing that it would never be OK with about 80% of women (my own estimate). I care more about passing on a legacy instead of DNA & making sure that if I decide to parent, it's 100% by choice because I know what it takes to raise a decent human being. There are more than enough unwanted kids out there in foster homes or single moms who probably don't want any more children for awhile.	I got tested when I was ~32. Both Mrs and I got tested after several years of unprotected sex failed to result in 'accidentally' producing a pregnancy. No idea what caused sterility, but it's there. I was a little upset for a while, but never having to worry about pregnancy was a good alternative. Since Mrs died a couple years ago, I'm sort of glad that I'm not raising any kids by myself. There are some mixed feelings, but I'm okay with who I am.
Girlfriend called in sick to work - they want a Doctors note. What pissed you off today?	It's a restaurant job, what did you expect? Those managers have to deal with so much bullshit from staff that this is usually the norm, particularly in corporate run establishments.	IMO employers that require doctor's notes should be required to pay for 100% of the visit. No reimbursements - bills sent directly to employer.
Do you have a 'never again' girl?	A feminist. The constant disparaging and belittling of me was not healthy. I was the personification of all the world's evil. Every accomplishment and trait was trivialized, every word had to be carefully chosen.	Yes, my ex. She was selfish and bad at communicating her wants/needs. Instead of addressing them by communicating and working through the issues, she decided cheating was easier. I dumped her shortly after. What sucked was she was my first major relationship and it lasted through my teens and into early college, so for many of our issues I thought,"well, this is how a relationship with women must be." Dating around and meeting new women quickly helped me realize this wasn't the case, thankfully.
What is the most fucked up secret you share with your SO?	Female here. I don't think there's anything he doesn't know. And if there does happen to be something, I have no problem telling him. I'm fairly certain he feels the same. If you can't trust your SO with all your deep dark secrets, you're probably with the wrong one.	Well there was the one time I was really drunk and thought I was in the bathroom but I was actually waking my wife up with a golden shower. She doesn't tell anyone about that night.
I feel like I'm 24 going on 18.. Need help on how to snap-to and grow up?	Finish your bachelors in business and lift weights. This combo will earn you more respect than you ever imagined possible.	Set reasonable, defined goals and hit them. I will find full-time employment in 3 months, not, I think I want a full-time job. I will move out in 6 months, not, It'd be nice to have my own place someday. So on and so forth. As for your interested and hobbies, don't worry about that to much. They are there for you to unwind from the grind of real life. If it's video games, so be it. Also, ask your dad to give you a kick in the ass. Metaphorically of course.
Has your SO ever started to become unattractive to you (weight gain)? How did you handle it?	lol bunch of feminists in this thread downvoting legitimate comments. If a girl is 5'2" 120 and goes up to 130, any sane man would have a talk with her or just dump her ass. 10 lbs is very noticeable on a girl that size and nobody's happy about FUPA	I got a little heavier in my last relationship. I gained 12lbs which isn't a big deal since I am 5'9" but it was noticeable. He came out and said "Hey I want to join the gym to get back in shape, let's go together. It'll motivate me more if I have you there cheering me on." I knew why he was bringing it up but I felt that was a very tactful and kind way of getting to the same point- that he was starting to find me unattractive physically and wanted me to care about my physical appearance again.
How would you react if your SO hit you? Would you leave?	I have never hit a woman but I would slap the hell out of bitch if she hit me first. If you act like a man I will treat you like one. I've made this crystal clear in every long term relationship I've been in and there has never been any physical abuse. My advice to anyone would be to set clear boundaries and never cross them. If you allow someone to hit you or abuse you in any way they are going to take advantage of it.	It depends. If we have many years of good history together, she's normally a non-violent person, and this is the first time? I'd first want to understand what happened, why now, and what's wrong. In other words, if it's an extreme anomaly and out of character, I want understanding. If it's a relatively new relationship, or she's shown aggressive/controlling behavior before? We're done. Instantly. I won't say a word, just exit, and worry about recovering my things later.
Fellow single men, what’s a dating dealbreaker that significantly reduces the dating pool for you?	No kids and not fat. Child free because I want to share that moment together. Fat is disgusting and a sign that they're a generally bad person. Of course those are dating standards. Fucking standards are wide open.	Someone who can talk to me and be super into what they're talking about. Vague I know But so many times you date a girl and ask her what her hobbies are or what she does in her spare time and the answer is always "just chill out" or "eat". So like when you're on your own you just sort of sit in your apartment doing nothing? Feels like they're just piggy backing off my interests and not bringing anything of their own to the relationship
Your SO sends you nudes that she had taken for a man in her past. How do you react?	> her reasoning is because she thinks she looked better back then I think if she thinks that, she needs to hit the gym.	"I want OC, you faggot." I wouldn't care. Unless his name is written on her chest in whipped creme, it's all the same. Maybe put in some special requests if you want something new.
Fathers, what are some important pieces of advice you would give to a daughter?	Stay away from feminism and the 'strong, independent woman' rhetoric. Embrace your femininity and cultivate grace. Take personal responsibility and accountability in everything that you do. Develop insight and the ability to be introspective about the choices that you make in the short term and the long term. Good/great men exist. Perfect men do not. Men and women aren't adversarial or equal but a great compliment to each other. Stay in good shape and take pride in your appearance.	I would say one thing would be to learn basic car mechanics stuff so you won’t be stranded somewhere over a flat tire or get ripped off at a mechanics shop.
What has a women friend, co-worker, class mate etc... said to you that caught you off guard and boosted your self esteem?	Earlier this week a security guard complimented me on my shoes. Lifted my day it did. Gonna hold on to that one for a while. It's probably the only compliment I will receive for the next 10 years.	I mentioned about being a little pissed that I had a disproportionate amount of work put on me and she said that was because I was the person in the company that people turned to when they needed to know the job would be done right. Still felt a bit pissed about it but that did feel good.
When is the last time you broke down and really cried?	On the 22nd of may 2017 I attended the Ariana Grande Concert in Manchester, a terror attack occurred at the end of the concert leaving over 100 injured and 22 dead. I'm not going into detail since I'm still recovering mentally but let's just say that no 16 year old should have to see such violence at a teens concert. I got home at 5am that night and cried myself to sleep, was in shell shock for a week and didn't sleep or eat a thing. Got counselling and I am finally coming to terms that I need to live my life since I'm so fortunate to get out that arena alive.	Girlfriend was diagnosed with cancer. It is highly survivable so I wasn't really overly concerned (optimist), but she was scared one night and I was holding her and it just got to me. Probably a good 15 seconds of crying. Can't remember the time before that.
How to properly go about forgetting someone that you can’t?	guess what.... you dont. an thats not a bad thing. learning to accept and live will come in time. right now its ok to feel your feels.	Time heals all wounds. In the mean time just find a hobby or something to get your mind off of it.
What is the best compliment you have recently received?	My close friend (girl) said "damn nice muscles, you look hot" after I sent her a random selfie. Feels good man.	One of my best friends told me he looks up to me like an older brother and that what I do in life motivates him to improve himself.
I think my friends fucked me over... But am I in the wrong?	Fuck em. Cut them out. Still living with them? Ghost them. If I were in your shoes, they wouldn't exist.	Just playing devil's advocate a bit, but did your friends actually say they were going? Or were they just invited but never confirmed?
How many of you would be open to taking birth of control if new forms for men came out?	Anything to not have to wear fucking condoms. Seriously the person who invented them is both a Saint and the devil incarnate.	Yes but not for a little while. If it's a new thing, I'd prefer to have adequate research on what it's doing to my junk.
What is it that's fundamentally wrong with fapping to friends/co-workers?	People are easily offended by things they have no control over. There is nothing wrong with, but it certainly is awkward to talk about. I don't, but my brain doesn't work that way. When I have sexual thoughts, the other players tend to be sort of weirdly generic.	If you are unable to treat someone with kindness and respect merely because you think they're hot and attractive, then you have much bigger problems that your masturbation habits.
What's the best escape tactic if your Tinder date is much uglier in real life?	I would straight up tell the person that she does not look at all what she does in her profile and that I'm not happy to have been lied to. Then take my leave.	This is why it's a good idea to plan those kind of first dates to be short, so have an easy out if you need it. Go for a quick coffee or something to start. It's easy to try and extend a date if it's going well or see if they want to go somewhere else nearby, but it's harder to just bail in the middle.
What is the strangest incompatibility you've had with an SO?	His stomach can't handle food that's been left out on the counter overnight. I can let food sit out on the counter for three or more days, and as long as it passes the sniff test, it's getting in my belly.	She didn't like thinking about anything outside of her immediate surroundings. She would get upset if I talked about space or even other countries. Apparently thinking of things like that made her uncomfortable.
What's the worst reason an ex said when breaking up with you?	"I need to find myself" bitch you're 14, you're not gonna find yourself for another 10 years. We did end up getting together off and on for like 10 years after that though. Consider her my soulmate, just not in this lifetime.	Out of the blue after 2 years together: Her:"I'm not attracted to you at all" Me:"Is it there someone else?" Her:"There is literally everyone else..."
FAQ FRIDAY: Does age matter when dating? If you've had to deal with significant age gaps in a relationship, what advice do you have for others?	Short term age isn't a big deal 5+ years difference pre 30. It's only a problem when there's a generation difference. Long term I've notice it's an issue. We grew up watching different shows, listened to different music, are at different stages in our lives. My best relationship has been with someone 1 year younger than me because we shared so much in common. My 4-6 year gap relationships just didn't last.	For me, I wouldn't date younger than 24? I'm turning 27 in Sept and I don't think I have much in common with people still in college and especially people younger than that. The biggest gap I had was when I was 21/22 and she was 18. At the beginning it was fine, she was in college at least and so was I but I feel like I matured faster than she did because I was getting ready to graduate, figure out my life and she was just a freshman. We broke up mainly due to that and the distance. We grew apart. I would view someone differently depending on how out of their range it was. 20/40 that's weird but not crazy. 16/25 is wrong to me, though it may be legal in places.
At what point did you notice that traditionally 'nerdy' things become mainstream?	When I see bimbos on instagram dressed as Misa Amane from Deathnote for Halloween. Gag. Like cool, what did you see the shitty Netflix rendition and then watch a couple episodes of the series and now you’re super anime chicc xmx	Well in the case of Marvel / DC i'd say its obviously due to the popularity of the movies. I don't think the comics side is seen as mainstream yet though, at least not in my country. I'm in the forces in the UK, and most the guys here love Marvel/DC. We even use the Avengers theme in a lot of our parades. I always find that weird.
What is it like to take anti-anxiety medicine?	Don’t really appreciate this, didn’t say I was an alcoholic or stoner but I’m literally in college and do enjoy doing those things occasionally like every other college kid.	Me. Mine is mostly social, so I’m on a low dose of buspar 2 times a day. I’ve really noticed a difference. Been talking to random people at the gym and in lines more often than i used to, without my heart racing and feeling like I’m going to throw up. The first few days were rough as my body adjusted to the meds, but now I don’t even notice those side effects anymore. Edit: i feel like my life is better. Side effects are different with different meds. Ask your doctor if you can drink or smoke. My dr said I’m allowed to drink.
Did you ever start at friends or bestfriends before you started dating?	As a man who is 5'5", I *only* can date people who have gotten to know me. I generally don't like going to bars and clubs to meet people because my tall friends have it so easy meeting people and I'm treated with an uncomfortable amount of disregard. Life on hard mode	We were coworkers that grew to be best friends. We kept each other securely in the friend zone for about 3 years. 2.5 years after dating officially we got married. I always used our relationship as an example of why relationships work out better when the couple was friends first. We never really fought. We had disagreements but we always worked them out calmly. Our similar viewpoints and desires for the future made it easy to combine efforts to reach our goals. We truly enjoyed each others company. We divorced after 11 years of marriage because she was having an affair with her best friend's boyfriend.
How common is it to have sex on the third date?	I think people have sex by the third date; it provides a decent baseline. If she isn't going to have sex with you by date three, you can probably assume that she isn't that interested in you and is stringing you along for free food and attention. It provides a more solid line to cut someone off by. Similarly, if men cannot commit to three dates even for sex, then he is probably not that interested in a real relationship. Again, a useful thing to measure by.	Depends on where you live. Here in Norway its pretty common to have sex first, then go on a date if you like each other.
What are your interests?	I really like playing RuneScape. Community is kind of mean, and its really repetitive at times but its the best MMORPG out there	Sorry not more people have commented yet but I'm into rugby and others are into (as I live in england) football/soccer. If you live in UK maybe that or American football. Generally keeping up with and doing some sports must be a good idea I think when people think of autism the gravitate towards an awkward albeano gaming kid with acne but I know this isn't true. Another thing I would say is try to be interested in whatever you want to be interested in, don't try to fit in too much but maybe if you talk to people about their interests you might find a mutual enjoyment in somthing. Hole this was a little helpful, sorry if not :)
What is the loneliest thing you have ever done?	Besides masturbate, this one time I was incredibly hungry after working out and rowing for a bit. My only roommate home over break with me gets up at 4:30 a.m. so he went to bed and left me too hungry to sleep so I decided to go get some food from a bar and then ordered a pizza. Glad I got food, but it would've been great to have some company.	A month after my divorce, I went to a TGI Friday's for supper by myself. It was Christmas night. I brought a book.
When will men realize that dick size rarely matters?	I learned this fairly recently when I started getting insecure. From what I've learned, there are women who crave the big penises but theyre definitely the minority. Also, guys seem to be hung up on the length when most women I've talked to say girth matters more. Anyway, most women can't orgasm from PIV sex alone anyway. Foreplay is definitely important. One of my female friends said that if you know what to do with your mouth and hands, you'd be golden. Besides, apparently most guys who have huge trouser snakes seem to think that alone makes them a sex God. It's apparently just 5-10 minutes of jackhammering and minimal foreplay lol.	You gave hope to everyone with a 3 inch dick and then yanked it straight out of their hands Kidding aside, some things people will always be insecure about, and I feel like most women walking the developed world today understand that very well.
How would you feel if a woman (or anyone for that matter) came up to you in public and asked if they could stick with you for a bit, because they're being harressed/feeling unsafe?	What? Honestly, men aren't around to protect you. That's not men's jobs. That's absolutely ridiculous. I would absolutely not be okay with a request like that.	It happens more than you might think, especially in places like bars and clubs. Over the years, I’ve been used that way by female friends and strangers alike, though obviously strangers a lot less. Try to pick someone who looks they they can handle themselves though. You can be bringing them a problem. Groups are good too.
How old is too old for a child to sit on your lap; or when does the physical contact situation change between an adult and child?	I dont know if me being a female changes this, but i have a 12yo cousing and i wouldnt have a problem with her sitting on my lap, specially in a situation like the one you mentioned. No wrong doing whatsoever.	My 12 and 13 year old daughters sit on my lap all the time. I see no problem with this.
What's something you can't tell your SO because it's better off they don't know?	That her friend has a dating profile. I know because I, too, have a dating profile and came across her friend's.	He uses far too many emojis. Don't get me wrong, I like using emojis but seriously majority of his texts are just emojis.
What's an example of time when your instincts were bang on?	My instinct to wanna suck on abigail shaprios BIG BOOBA BAZONKA ROCKERS certainly helped me cause damn I want that milkey goodness	A month ago my girlfriend or ex was lovey dovey and all that. And she eventually started getting bitter and distancing figured we’d break up but I held a sit down asked how she felt about the relationship and if I needed to change anything. She stated all was fine. New Year’s Day comes and I lower my guard down and she breaks up with me yadda yadda yadda “I just need a break” etc. she already has a new guy lined up 😐 I wanna say I’m angry but I’ve learned from this experience the high road is the best way possible. Plus I met someone else who’s really cool and I just asked them out today
Gentlemen. What SHOULD we give a fuck about?	Yourself Your career Your family (assuming you still talk to the fucks) Your bitch (if you have one) But in all seriousness: you should probably pay attention to what's going on in government. Not so you can do anything to affect the outcome (cuz you can't because you're not in the Club), but so you can learn how the system is rigged so you can game it to your advantage. Actually, you should learn how *any* system you're a part of is set up/rigged then figure out how to game it to your advantage. If life has taught me anything, it's that following the rules (and/or getting caught) is for chumps and idiots.	Nothing, man. Everything's temporary, man. Just a big spinning ball of dirt in space, man. The existence of humanity is just a sneeze in the universe, man.
Guys who used to think too much instead of taking action, how did you become strong?	Get some determination and stop being a pussy that relies only on motivation. Motivation is fickle, the only thing that is reliable is determination. Stop whining on Reddit and actually take daily steps to improve your life even if they are small.	I'm still at my first job I got in high school and I'm 23. Some of my friends have already gotten married, own homes, are making money in their careers. It feels bad but I try to feel happy for them instead of being jealous. My time will come one day.
What quote has had the greatest impact on how you live your life so far?	"But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all of these things will be added to you." Matthew 6:33	From a friend, that had a REALLY tough life, when I told him I didn't want to bother him with my, comparatively, minor issues. His answer: "I don't care if it's a broken nail or something more serious. What I do care about, is how you feel about it, if it's an issue for you it IS worth talking about. " -> It stuck with me ever since, and changed my way of communicating with people.
Minority men - How do you cheer yourself up after a bigoted encounter?	im a white guy who was walking over my lunch break once and got called a honky by a car full of guys. don't let someone else get you down.	I'm the only black guy in any of my Engineering classes and it became a thing for all the Middle Eastern guys to call me Will Smith for some reason. So to play it off with even more trolling I kept ensuring them when the world goes to shit I wouldn't give Abdul and friends the cure. (It was wrong to call them all Abdul) but I had to troll back.
Men- what's a few things you wish your SO would 'get' about you?	I want her to get the fact that I don't like arguing but we start because she takes my jokes too seriously. And that she needs to know that I don't like weed, it's not cute.	I don't feel the need to cram as many activities into my free time as possible and it annoys the shit out of me when you do and then guilt me into playing along. Just because we have a Saturday free doesn't mean we need to have activity after activity after activity planned so we spend the entire day touring the whole god damn state. I don't mind doing things, but I also want to have some time to just relax without having to schedule it between activities and adventures.
Do you ask a girl what she likes or wants before having sex?	Never ask. That's pussy shit. Girls are turned on by guys that know what they want and act on it.	Keep it vanilla the first few time, then have a grown up conversation, not in the middle of sex about each persons kinks and limits.
Your girlfriend says she's hungry, what do you do?	Say: now that you mention it I’m hungry too, (kindly give her a small kiss) then continue saying “make us some sandwiches honey “ and send her her way with a slap on that ass .. it Works!! And don’t forget my fav drink darling.	Me: “What do you want to eat?” Her: Has a complex list of requiring 4 different stops at completely unrelated food locations. “I don’t know.” Me: “What don’t you want?” Her: Still has that list. It does not feature Chinese takeout. “...I don’t want Chinese.” Me: Starts listing every restaurant in a 10 mile radius. Her: “...actually... now that you mention it, I haven’t had Chinese in a while.”
Men in LTRs or marriages, how has sex evolved in your relationship?	the first two years, put a penny in a jar every time you have sex after the first two years, every time you have sex take a penny out of the jar. The jar will never be empty	For us, the heat has increased tremendously over the years. The frequency has been pretty consistent at about 5 times a week. Most days we get busy. For us, it has gotten better and better. Comfort only grows. We laugh in bed. We try anything that comes to mind. We are really attracted to each other. We realize that sometimes only one of us might be in the mood. It is not hard to give it up for the one you love, and you usually end up in the mood along the way... We respect each other. All of that adds up to an amazing sex life that keeps getting better and better. We joke that it is not likely that anyone does it as well as we do and the jokes on them, cause it 's easy... Together 13 years, married 10 in September.
What societal pressures are there on men to 'man up'?	Sex. Men dont get sex if we dont man up. Basically women use sex as a reward. Power of the pussy etc. Pussy dries up fast when men start crying. On the other hand, a girl crying can get us hard i.e dont worry we'll save you etc. You should check out a book called The Manipulated Man by Esther Vilar (a woman surprisingly enough) written about 40 years ago on how this dynamic works. Or, The Great Female Con, or Sexploytation, or The Predatory Female or quite a few blogs and forums which discuss this stuff.	The general idea is this. If a man's down or in a bad place, it means he's a failure or has failed in some way. You must man up and not complain. When people see a man who can't handle something, their first reaction is disgust. If a woman's down or in a bad place, it means she's a victim. People simply do not hold women to the same level of responsibility. When people see a woman who can't handle something, their first reaction is empathy.
Men with small penises, how has it affected your self esteem and your sex life?	This is a little off topic, but I've been with men who are 7 inches and were still self conscious about their size. I felt bad that they felt that way.	In all honesty, the only thing you can do is to bang him so much that his dick gets sore. He's not going to get over it by you being empathetic because once you say "Oh it's fine," then he knows how bad the situation really is. Just keep demanding sex from him and get him to a point where he knows you're enjoying it because you keep wanting it.
Men, have you ever been accused of rejecting/excluding/being rude to a woman just because she is a woman, and it was not that way at all?	I posted on AskWomen once and thought I was going to get killed. They aren't very friendly over there, especially if your just asking an honest question.	When I was at school we went on trip to the House of Commons and we met our local MP. I asked a question about the fact that her and many other MPs round where I live aren't locals. She went on this big long tirade about how people like me were backward and think our MPs should all be men who grew up in the area, never left and work in the local factory. Aside from the fact that she's a Labour Party MP and plays up to the fact that her father's a former factory worker, I was a bit put annoyed that she got defensive and built up a straw man rather than politely answering me, as a young student from the area she's supposed to represent.
When urinating into a toilet while within earshot of females, do you quietly aim your stream onto the edge of the bowl so you don't gross them out, or do you piss directly into the deepest part of the water for maximal decibel output so that your dick sounds bigger?	I don't ever do that when "females" are around. However, I do occasionally do it when women (you know, the actual name for human beings) are nearby.	Ok, I have to say as a girl if I hear a guy peeing super loudly I wouldn't think he had a big dick. I would think he had been holding in his pee for a long time. I don't even have a dick but can pee super loud, myself, after a few beers, so I don't see the correlation.
What does it take for you to feel desired/loved by a woman?	To be left the fuck alone every now and again and not have to discuss how I'm feeling. I'd like this to occur with no prompting or arguments	When she says she loves me. When she wants to be near me and touch me. When she puts her head on my shoulder, lap or chest.
Have you ever passed up sex with a woman because it was the smart thing to do, and then you fantasized about it for the rest of your life?	A teacher I had in college.. I was 16yrs she must've been early 20s .. 24 I think.. Anyway she was petite with large perky firm looking breasts.. She would stare at Me and have long chats with Me... I just had zero fucking game.. My mind was bit of a mess.. Early stages of depression.. Then i played truant.. And when I finally returned.. She was gone .. I didn't even get to say goodbye. Every now and then when I'm 'tugging the bishop' I think about all the things I should've done.. God bless your tits Ms.Abbott.	Well. There was a crazy girl I messed with a bit long ago. She went down on me once. A few weeks later we had a really drunken hookup where neither of us "finished." I knew she was bad news so I wanted to cut things off. She sent me a text or message basically asking to try again, and the thought briefly crossed my mind that I could make her fulfill my fetishes. My brain prevailed, but for years I wondered what she would have been willing to do...
Men with the lower libido in a relationship: what ways have you found to compromise and work through it together?	Depends on why he is anti-sex. For me I think full sessions are fucking exhausting and I am lazy. Once a week is plenty. Foreplay is nigh effortless though so my SOs never go wanting. See if he'll go down on you or jam some fingers or toys in you every day.	What worked for my fiance and I is just to do sex acts... not necessarily PIV sex. Hands do more for me anyways and it's more of him giving me pleasure out of the goodness of his heart rather than having to spend the energy and try to hold the erection, etc. He fiddles me, I cum in his arms, and it's done. If he gets in the mood from it, all the better, but I won't ask that of him.
What are some of your petty turn offs?	If I became single now... I shudder to think of the emojis I'd be subjected to. I fucking hate emojis. A "😂" and he would never see me again.	If you smack your lips when you eat or slurp everything you drink I'm never taking you out in public.
Do men really not speak to each other in public bathrooms?	It is a taboo. And if you DARE to look anywhere besides your dick or the front wall while you pee, some men in tuxedos will come in, grab you and thats the last anyone will see about you.	It is utterly taboo. You do not acknowledge the existence of other people in the bathroom. The only exception is if you're in the middle of a conversation when you both walk in, in which case you carry on, and do not acknowledge the existence *of the bathroom*. Why? Same reason you don't talk in the elevator. People are pushed too close together (with the added awkwardness of having their dick out). When there's not enough physical space, you contract your social space to compensate.
How common is it for men to believe that sexual partner count influences how a woman's vagina looks/feels?	Probably not uncommon because its how it works for some other organs (like anus). Its not like men have vaginas so they just extrapolate based on the organs they have/know more about.	I would just like to point out that if muscles truly worked like that, well your anus would be kind-of a limited-use deal. Can't say I know of anyone who ever took a few large dumps and got permanent Olestra-butt from it.
Dear men, at what point in the night should we tell you that we have a SO?	Offer him a way to save face. E.g.: "You seem cool, but I have a boyfriend. Tell you what, I'll wingwoman you with those cute girls at the bar." Basically, turn the rejection into an adventure. I mean, you're at the bar to have fun, right?	Although i'm only 18, I've appreciated it when girls just bring up their partners after i ask a question: For example: What are you doing later tonight? "Oh I'm going to my boyfriends house". That way I know to move on. I feel like the vast majority of guys will appreciate that and if we strike up a conversation we are either interested or scoping you out for a friend
Adult Men/Dads, How do you handle it all without going insane?	Its funny you mention Ukraine and Isis. I live in Israel. This past summer was wild. I live close to Syria and Lebanon and Hizbollah is threatening to start war in the North soon. Im in rocket range. We have gas masks in case of a chemical attack. But me and my wife are pretty chilled about the whole situation. We trust in God. It sort of comes with living in Israel. i was also in Ukraine 2 weeks ago and nothing happened to me. Just chill. Besides that - i pray, meditate,smoke cigarettes and makes lots of music. edit- why downvotes?	Plan everything. Try "outsourcing" as much things as you can - hire a cleaning lady, hire someone to do yard work, don't fix the car yourself take it to the mechanic, etc. When I stopped doing shit myself it was magic. I lost out on some money, but I gained a ton of time that just didn't exist before.
How many drinks/beers do you have a day?	OP you know damn well it's not healthy and that you should cut back... otherwise you wouldn't even have bothered to ask	Most people don't drink every day. 15% of people over 18 have never had a drink. about 30% of the population won't typically drink during the year. about 44% won't drink every month. at 2-3 beers a day you are into the top 10% of American Alcohol consumers (assuming you are American) the cutoff for which is 15 a week.
What books are you currently reading?	The Stand by Stephen King. Its actually my first Stephen King book and its great! Edit: Wow after posting this I scrolled down to see im not the only one! NEAT	"The Wise Man's Fear" by Patrick Rothfuss...for about the 5th time. It is just so entertaining and readable. Also, "The Last Unicorn" by Peter S. Beagle, which is highly regarded by a number of people I regard highly.
What is something you never have and never will tell your past or present SO?	Honestly, if she was a vegetarian for very long prior to eating that lasagna she would have gotten quite sick from eating that meat.	A was having sex with a girl and a very large spider popped out from behind her head. I smooshed it with my hand and kept going. She had a spider phobia and would tremble at just seeing a photo of one. She will never know.
What's your most memorable experience with women who are convinced you're attracted to them, when you're really not?	This is a weirdly specific question. I would like to remind OP that agenda-posting is not allowed in this sub.	I lost a friend because she pulled me aside one day to tell me that she's flattered but she really doesn't like me like that. I'm just a good friend. I smiled and told her the truth, the truth being that I feel the same way and am not romantically attracted to her. She got a little salty and sullen and we were never really close again. I figure she was actually into me and was using that conversation to gauge how I felt in her own teen way.
What did you learn about your SO after moving in with them?	Literally nothing new that wasn't a tiny quirk or a small habit. And we (in all practicality) didn't live together until we were married. I simply do not buy the idea that you have to live with someone to know them very well.	Not my current girlfriend, but my previous one. First of all, I'm white and she's black. When she moved in, I realized that she owned a *lot* of romance novels involving black women with white men.
Have you ever been rejected because you're not from the right continent/race?	Not that I know of. I am White British so I guess not as likely to have the issue as others might.	Asian guy here. And yeah, I've been turned down by nonAsians because they don't find Asian men attractive. I had one memorable girl at a bar tell me that she didn't see Asian men as men.
If you and your SO woke up and had switched bodies, what’s something they would need to know?	Electron microscopy, as that's my job. My boss would be baffled that one of the better technicians is suddenly ass at his job. A whole bunch of programming languages, both for my job and for school, along with Git, Vim, and a couple of other tools that I like to use.	If you try and bend the right knee past 150° you'll be in pain for weeks. Additionally, holding an athletic position for longer than 5 minutes will cause the knee to fail entirely. Random pricks of pain are sporadic, global, but go away or you get used to it. The right foot cracks when rotated. The joint connecting your left leg to your pelvis is wonky. Your stomach is lying to you. In order to "that" trick you have to mimic a heartbeat rhythm when you flex.
How many of you are happily willing to financially support a woman that you love?	I don't see myself ever making enough money to support a family by myself. I'm afraid of getting divorced because alimony will be a lot if I have a housewife. I'd rather be the one getting supported. So any wife of mine will have to be gainfully employed. Housewife just isn't for me. I'd make an exception if I somehow come into a LOT of money. I'm talking millions.	Personally, I don't want to be the sole financial "breadwinner". Obviously if it comes down to me taking the lion's share of the burden, I'm willing to put in the effort to keep us afloat, but if I were to have a career setback or jump, I would expect my wife, who I see as an equal partner in this arrangement, to then take up the mantle.
What would you guys do if you woke up on New Years Day and realised it was the start of 2014 again?	Does starting a youtube channal earlyer count? If it does, i would be totally ._. since it would be a ton of wasted effort, but a faster startup :D + i would be starting off better content	My grandfather and my dog would be alive again, so I'd spend a hell of a lot more time with them both.
How do you start from scratch making friends when over 30?	You can try meetup, but i wouldnt recommend it. The people there are.. weird..in a bad way. I don't know how to explain it but theyre all over 35 and look like virgins. You might get lucky and find someone else who also decided to check it out their first time, but i doubt it since they post pics and that keeps normal people away. Id say go join a sports league, made some good bros back in the day when i played.	Dude start playing basketball at the same time at the gym everyday. Even if you suck. Just start a routine anywhere and independent of her. Bros will come bro. Bros always find bros.
Academically successful men, what were your study techniques?	I never studied all the way up through my master’s. Skipped class a bunch, played a lot of video games, smoked a lot of pot, rolled in and took the exams. Normally an A or B.	Try to procrastinate as little as possible. Remind yourself that time moves faster than you think and whatever fun you are planning it's not more important than your studying.
Men who use or have used steroids - whats it like?	I've never used steroids, but my dad did for a while when he was in college and he's told me about some of the experience. From what I remember, he said it took a few times dosing to take effect, but he said when he lifted for the first time after taking them, his usual warm up weight on bench press -- 135 pounds -- felt "like a feather" when he lifted it off the rack. He said he banged out like 20 reps instantly and then went on to achieve his personal max at the time.	It helped me recover from the weirdest medical issue I've ever had. So hey, kudos to steroids for de-paralysing my freaking face.
Men of Reddit, what is one thing that you think every woman should know?	At least look behind you before you let the door slam shut. A lot of men do this to be chivalrous, but because when you don't do it, you look you do it makes it obvious you only think about yourself.	I can't read your mind. If you want me to know something, the best way is to just tell me and save everyone a lot of time and grief.
What the actual fuck is wrong with my boyfriend?	What the fuck is wrong with your BF! Seriously. Probably he was depressed as shit, but, if my GF comes with me in my bday with a gift (no matter what) wrapped in underwear, wishing me a happy bday, the least I do (no matter how shitty about my self feels), it is to hug and kiss her and say thanks to her. I mean, his behavior sucked.	This isn't too different from the woman who asked why her boyfriend became distant after he lost his job. Truth is, we internalise our feelings (well some of us) and when our pride and self-esteem as been fucked with we go into a cave and we don't come out until we want to ourselves. I don't see how giving him a games console when he's stressed about feeling unemployed is gonna do anything but make him feel worse. How is he supposed to enjoy such a present while he's out trying to find employment. while its true he is wrong for smashing the present, and I understand your intentions were good, you failed to take his first warnings and pushed him into an emotional response. The games console is a nice present, but it could have waited for a better time.
Men, describe sex with a chubbier chick vs a thin chick. Which do you prefer ?	Chubbier is better. Everything is rounder and softer, even internally. Fucking a really skinny chick is like sticking your dick in that dryer hose that has those metal rings embedded in it. The only advantage of a skinnier girl is that her clitoris can be more exposed, meaning she'll enjoy the sex more.	Smaller makes some positions more viable, but bigger means more durable, making some activities a lot easier, specifically but not limited to kink and generally permitting a sort of greater amount of vigor. The diminishing rate of return drops off a lot narrower for thin, though. I'm not sure that I have a preference. I have fun with different types of bodies in different ways. There might even be a bit of 'the grass is always greener' going on.
If a guy says that he is willing to have sex with me but won't date me, does this mean that he only sees me as a thing to fuck or can I still trust that he sees me as a human?	You seem quite offended. Thankfully, physical attractiveness has little to do with how dateable a person can be. Basically, your inability to understand his meaning only confirms it; you're pretty, but you're not good enough otherwise (personality, compatibility, etc.) to date.	He probably thought he came off as coming on to you, and wanted to rectify it. He still sees you as human, but he probably thinks you don't have a personality compatible enough with him to date.
Slept on the couch last night because I suggested to the wife that we try formula for our baby. Men of Reddit, what's some other 'doghouse' stories for no reason?	Cold shoulder the bitch until she gets the point that reacting that way on her emotions isn't appropriate. Unfortunately, you're really fucked over here either way you go about things. If she decides to keep abusing you, you'll be ostracized and told to "man-up" when you try and contact the police. If you defend yourself, you'll be arrested and jailed. If you divorce her, you'll never see your child again and you'll pay a monthly stipend for that "privilege." Good luck, dude. I have no advice, because there's no advice to give. All you can do is hope she un-fucks her mind and returns to sanity. Also, retreat to the couch every night this week. Maybe she'll get the point.	I don't have anything to add about the OP and his situation, but I will say that I never understood the "send your man to the couch" mentality. The few times I've been immature enough to do something like this, I just go to the couch myself. I am the one who wants separation for whatever reason, so I just leave and sleep there. Shit, the bed is shared and I have no more claim over it than he does.
Has a girl ever done something that made you want to dump her "on the spot"?	Not a GF but I was talking to a chick at a bar and we were really hitting it off until Under Pressure by Queen came on. She said "I love Vanilla Ice!" Without saying a word I turned and walked away.	Screamed out "you gave me AIDS!!!" in the middle of a restaurant and broke down crying because she got sick three months into us dating. She believed all black people had aids. She went to the doctor, got an AIDS test, a few days later she told me it was just a sore throat and that she might of overreacted. She didn't even apologize.
Would you like to see naked photos of my GF?	Depends if he'd lend me his phone to whack off. Picture a gibbon masturbating at the zoo. With a phone. That'd be me.	No matter what happens, any pictures given to me have never and will never be shown to other people. It is disrespectful. Even if we argue and completely fall out; even if she disappears from my life; even if she cheats on me. I refuse to stoop to such a level. EDIT: Wow :O thanks for the Reddit Gold, anonymous awesome person!
Do funny women finish last?	Because a lot of women are too serious and can't take a joke. We want women who will laugh instead of calling us names	You know, I've read about all these traits women have that turn men off: men don't like smart women, men don't like powerful women, men don't like successful women, and now men don't like funny women. I've read about them all here on the internet. However, I've never met ANYONE like that in real life. Seriously. No one has ever thought, "Oh man, this girl is hot. I want to bang the.... wait, is she making a joke? And it's a good one? FUCK THIS!"
Would you date a fat girl?	If I think she is FAT, NO. The episode of Catfish isn't realistic. You mean to tell me that the man had absolutely no interest in her physically at all? That he didn't pursue trying to see her before they met, before he opened up his heart and mind and quite possibly soul to her? In other words, became emotionally vulnerable. This isn't a massive issue of betrayal, it's a massive issue of irresponsibility and cowardice. If the man KNEW that he would not go forward with it if she wasn't physically attractive enough to maintain his desire for her then it was his responsibility to ensure she WAS before he went down that road. If a girl in all respects is perfect for me, she wouldn't be fat because she would be: Health conscious. Eat good foods. Exercise consistently. Feel sexy being fit.	I'm sorry - I realise this is not going to be popular. No. I'm just not attracted to fat women. In fact, I like mine slim. HOWEVER, my tastes are by no means universal. Many women do not find me attractive - but I've learned to appreciate that many women DO. Same for big girls. Some guys will not be attracted to you. Accept that and find a guy who *is* attracted to you and your life will be much better for it.
Do men really think women are illogical?	Here's some interesting reading from an article that's as old as the internet itself (which I won't link to because the rest of it is a lot of misogynistic hate): >Women are basically emotionally driven. If they feel it, they do it, period. Then they rationalize it to themselves later. Nothing is more meaningful, or compelling, to a woman than (1) the way she feels and (2) learning more about her own inner self and having emotional realizations. That's why women love astrology, chick flicks, soap operas, stupid Cosmo quizes that supposedly reveal info about yourself, etc.	Honestly, I think everyone is illogical. No-one seems to actually apply logical thought processes to their life. Women in particular? Not really. Some women are more illogical than some men, and vice versa. It balances out.
Do guys masturbate to girl's bikini pics on Facebook...?	I've never done it, seems really weird to me. I've never heard any of my IRL friends admit to it either, and I'd be pretty surprised if I found out they did. The awkwardness/creepiness factor, plus the fact that there's *actual pornography* online is enough to put me off doing it, and then there's the whole using-someone's-pictures-without-their-consent thing that is pretty awful IMO.	A girl you've met is generally more attractive than a girl who has always been in 2 dimensions. That said, yeah, it's awkward.
If you could change one thing about women in general, what would it be?	I would eliminate their sense of entitlement, or in other words the "you owe/must do X, Y and Z because I'm a girl" attitude.	Make it so that they would only become fertile when they wanted to. Or maybe I would change that about men instead. Ideally without affecting sex drive.
Why does my boyfriend have such a hard time giving me compliments, but so easily give me criticism?	Because somtimes criticism needs to be said, compliments however don't strictly need to be said at all. Thats how a callous, unfeeling asshole would view it. You're going out with one.	I just got back from my office christmas party, so I'm inebriated. Why does he have a hard time giving compliments? Because He's a fucking asshole. Dump this asshole. I'm drunk.
What is your shallowest/pickiest red flag in a potential partner?	Stupidity. That Repulses Me In A Girl So So Much. No Intelligence = No Good. That Is My Biggest Red Flag.	Women who pass judgement on your job/salary while they are working a minimum wage job. Major red flag of entitlement...
So men...how fat is fat on a woman?	Most of the other guys here consider 35% and higher to be fat? WTF, 35% ain't even average. I find all the bodies up to and including 35% attractive, but I wouldn't use the term "fat" for any but the last two. 40% is a weird case - it doesn't look like she's carrying the weight well. In the body type chart: 12 and 16 and above also seems to lose quite a bit of attractivess, except for 19. Hrm. Wonder why. Not really into 7 either. She's got a pretty face, but those muscles just scare me. Also 14 appears to have a lower BMI that what is really average, 3's proportions appear to be 'shopped (the difference between her chest and hips is rather inhuman) and maybe 1 is 'shopped too.	In the rough bodyfat chart, 35% is the threshold, but the thing is different women carry weight differently. For example that 30% woman looks great in that picture and she obviously carries that weight very well, where another woman just wouldn't look that good.
What do you want out of a wife?	Someone who matches me in ambition, greed, drive for self improvement, and brutal honesty. Intelligence, desire for biological immortality, and the belief in improving/replacing body parts with tech is pretty necessary too. You know. A partner.	It sounds cliche, but communication, I've been married almost 20 years and the key for us has always been communication, IF something is bothering her, I want her to let me know, don't keep it bottled up until you explode, SAY something.
Do guys really hate to "talk" about feelings?	A lot of people on /r/askmen think that men are pressured into hiding their feelings, because women aren't attracted to weakness. Perhaps that's been their experience, I don't know. In my experience, it isn't difficult to figure out whom you can talk to about your feelings and with whom you should keep it to yourself. And if it's someone you trust, such as an SO, you should be completely open.	Everytime I opened up I got dumped shortly after. I learned fast there is a vast disconnect between what women say they want and what they actually want. The more I posture as an impenetrable alpha male the more success I have with the ladies. I would love to open up. But time and history have shown there is no faster way for her to "lose the spark".
"Nice girl syndrome" - I feel like I embody this completely. Is this something that's considered negative (story included)?	There's no such thing as "nice girl syndrome" with guys. There's "not as attractive as the other girl syndrome." Sorry, but it's true.	This is pretty much the stereotypical friend-zoned nice guy situation, except with a nice girl instead. I'll give you the same advice. It's interesting how niceness relates to and interacts with attraction and romance. In my opinion, niceness is not a negative itself, but often it's used to cover up (or it's just a mislabelling of) things that are negatives, like insecurity or desperation (usually the belief that you don't have anything else to offer, so you'll just be really nice). With that said, niceness is also not going to secure attraction by itself. Who becomes attracted to someone just because they were nice to them? Unless they also have problems with insecurity, not many people. Most people will say they want a nice person as a partner, but what they really mean is that they want an attractive person who's also nice. That's how I see niceness.
Got girlfriend pregnant. Abortion is set for Thursday. How do I be supportive?	Just two small things. 1. Does she want the abortion? 2. Having a baby young is not the end of the world. If you think you can realistically do it (not that it would be easy), would you permanently commit to the woman and your child? Just food for thought.	My best advice would be to remember that being support doesnt mean showing no emotion. Don't worry if you feel yourself getting caught up and crying. Sometimes to understand that someone feels the same way as you do can be the most comforting thing in the world
Guys, do you need to be needed?	No, we're heartless creatures and don't deserve to be needed. Does your father want to be needed when you were growing up? Does your mother want to be needed when you were growing up? We are humans too, obviously you don't care about the guy if you don't want to need him, this is the whole point of the relationship...	Just an FYI, but whenever it seems like things aren't going well (date life) because of things that aren't really problems (your self sufficiency), it's probably a good sign that your own delusion is stopping you from seeing the real problem. I highly doubt that people are dumping you because you're *not* a burden on them. It's probably something else you're not aware of and/or admitting, or it could just be the competition in your environment is offering up a better deal for these particular dudes.
How do I stop wasting your time when you haven't explicitly asked me out?	To directly answer your question: fast, without any room for misunderstandings, cruel if need be. I can always have a comeback, among the lines: well aren't we having a great opinion about ourself! to save face. You apologise and blame it all on a misunderstanding, and we're all good. side note: why not date him? even ask him out yourself, you already have some common ground.This maybe because I have a penis, but that's my go to reaction when I know someone is interested.	"Oh, you're so cool! I think I have the perfect girl for you." If you really do, bonus. If you don't, he'll get the hint.
How many of you know how to drive a car with a manual transmission?	I never drive an automatic. I don't understand how people can be so lazy to not learn how to drive properly.	Whenever I meet a new girl I like. I ask her if she wants to shift gears for me. This follows by her not knowing how to do it and me handing her hand while helping her pushing into the next gear. Works everytime. Bitches love it.
Shy guys of reddit: how do I come on to you?	Sounds like you don't want a shy guy, you wan't a reserved person. Shy implies weak willed, socially incompetent, fear of social interaction. Reserved just implies they won't approach you for one reason or another, but it's not related to the issues above. That being said, just say hello. "Hello, my name is I_Shot_JFK, nice to meet you"	Tell him he seems fun or interesting, just let him know you're talking to him because you want to, not because you're waiting for someone else. Get a drink or two in him if you can. Don't make a big deal about long pauses or stutters, we're not well practiced in being social. Go straight into deep topics, we're pretty bad at small talk but we sure as shit love to think, give us something to think about. Be honest, we know when you're lying, we pride ourselves on knowing. Don't focus on our shyness, it's a symptom not a trait, try to figure out why we're shy, that's where the interesting parts of our personality is.
I refuse to date women that expect continual use of condoms in a long term relationship. Is that an unfair condition to place on a relationship?	I'm with you on this, i've only had sex with my ex-gf of 3,5 years together, she was on pills as soon as we started having sex and as far as the risk of pregnancy, we had no problem. Just one brief scare when she thought she had missed taking the pill one day, but it turned out she had taken it, just kinda slipped her mind. For a longterm relationship, I also feel birth control over condoms is the way to go, for sure. At the moment it's not really up to me but if I could do it myself, I definately would.	That's fine, but be prepared for potential consequences. I can't be on hormonal birth control. My ex hated condoms so I decided to try a 96% effective cervical cap AND spermicide gel and got pregnant.
Would you be offended if your wife admitted that she "settled" for you?	I would NEVER be with someone if I am settling and I would be heartbroken if I leaned my S/O was settling by being with me. I would rather be single than second choice and I would rather be single than settle for my second choice.	>What do you think of the idea that Gottlieb is promoting here? I think what Gottlieb is *really* saying to women is to forget the Prince Charming stuff, there is no knight in shining armor, so stop with the entitlement stuff and find a real man that exists on planet earth. If that is "settling," it is settling for reality.
Guys of Reddit, how do you tell the difference between a friendly girl and one who has feelings for you?	Whether or not I find myself inside them is a pretty good indicator as to whether the like me or not.	fuck if I know EDIT: this is the worst comment in the thread I didnt even answer OP I just fuckin typed some bullshit so I could feel like I contributed why can't you guys upvote something helpful
what do you guys think of this not so famous Will smith quote?	Oh yeah. Will Smith's life has been such a struggle. Damn all those friends that didn't stick by him when he foolishly spent all his music money and was offered a chance in a fledgling NBC show.	The difference seems to me that the Will Smith quote is about his circumstances and not shitty parts of his personality.
Have you ever said something to a woman in anger that totally changed the relationship forever?	Yes. I don't recommend talking when you're angry. But I don't think it's fair for a spouse with no job to complain that you're not cleaning up around the house.	Yes. I can't remember my exact words but it went something like "You're a gold digging leech of a person just like your mother."
If a girl remembered a small detail, of a personal preference of yours, that you mentioned a long time ago, would you be flattered or weirded out?	OMG! PLease id love that id love for women to remember shit i told them....... i do how the heck would it be strange if you remembered something i said. If you dont il be confused and feel hurt that what i said you did not give a rats ass about and where just letting in one ear and out the other just to humor me.	I'm always very flattered when people remember minuscule details, because it makes me feel like they really listen to me when I speak, or they at least care enough to remember.
My girlfriend has been friends with this guy since she was really young, he also has a girlfriend. He's visiting her for the weekend to hang out since they haven't in a while. Although I trust her, I can't help but feel really weird about it. You guys had similar experiences?	Whether it is legitimate friendship or not she is being inconsiderate of you in the choice to be alone with another man.	You can't control everything. At some point you have to believe that she will not leave the house just to find another guy. There's this cheater prevention mentality that I don't think is worth shit. If someone wants to cheat they'll cheat. You can try to be there all the time to prevent it but that will just push them away. She's with you now, so she's already made a decision to be with you and not someone else. You either trust that decision or you don't.
Is he a creeper or just lonely?	I don't care for the word creeper, but it's more than lonely. Obviously he's depressed, suicidal, and desperate for connection. I don't know why you jump to getting raped from there, but I'd just put him on limited profile so he can't see your wall, photos etc.	While he may have depression issues, its even more unhealthy for him to live in a fantasy world based off your social media profiles. I think you need to unfriend and block him, otherwise his obsession will continue to grow and continue to influence your life.
Would you ever be a house-husband?	I'd like to say life is fair and even, but I honestly believe that if I did my (future) wife would lose respect for me. I also believe sexually oriented characteristics are innate, and it would be slightly conflicting to everyone in the family	> Assuming kids are not a factor Honestly, are there even housewives in situations where kids aren't a factor? It really doesn't take that long to run errands, clean the house and doing occasional bouts of car/house maintenance.
About three hours ago I caught my girlfriend stealing money from me. What do I do?	Is there any chance she was just borrowing the money and was going to tell you when you got out of the shower?	> The bank says the cannot do anything right now because technically it's her money too (since we share the account). It is not "technically" her money. It's a shared account. It IS her money. You need to get a lawyer because you're in for a nasty fight.
Who was the one girl that almost drove you over the edge of sanity?	I was under the impression OP meant sexually or via seduction. You know, the someone that gets your engine revving, the one that knows how to flip the sexual switch but either doesn't or can't go all the way or gives you that mind-blowing orgasm. I guess I was wrong?	Well, I'll say something else form the rest. My mother, she shouted for no reason. Oh you left a wrapper on the table? That'll be a 30 minute lecture on why you are a useless piece of shit...just like your father. I mean, it's easier to just do it yourself or remind me about it. And now imagine 18 years of this. There were many occasions where I almost snapped and shouted back and i hate rising my voice.
What was the weirdest thing a woman has ever done to you?	One time this woman kept me prisoner in her womb, and kicked me out 9 months later. Fuckin weird shit man.	Tried to set me on fire for no reason. She wasn't mad or anything. She just held a lighter to my back and scorched my jacket a little before I noticed
Men, do you find navel piercing hot? Why?	Women with them are often times slutty in nature, and I don't find them attractive. I don't like piercings for the most part, and tattoos were always a dealbreaker for me. I just find it to be low-class.	Depends on the tummy that's got it, and on the style of piercing. Navel piercings can definitely be a turn on on the right woman, and a turn off on the wrong woman. The surrounding clothes and tattoos make a difference, too.
As a 16 year old kid still in highschool, what should I need to know about life and growing up?	1.Education is everything, disregard partying/females 2.Don't pick a loser career with no job opportunities/you will make minimum wage. Ex. Any social science, 99% of business degrees etc... If you're book smart/do well in school go into engineering of some sort. If you don't do well in school go into a trade. Be honest with yourself about your academic potential. 3. Start lifting weights as soon as possible. Being big/fit will do more for your self esteem/confidence/success with women/respect you get from men than practically anything else. subscribe to r/theredpill	You're never grown up, you never have it figured out, and you should never be still. You should be constantly learning and improving yourself, intellectually, physically, and emotionally. Make every day a day to be a better man.
Ask men, where do you think women fail the most in relationships?	In my personal experience and from observing my friends and acquaintances: * Think the relationship is entirely about them * Not willing to put effort into the relationship * Staying with someone who is a lost cause	Communicating and understanding insecurities. Relating that information in a calm way to your partner, and then working together to resolve them. I think men fail at this too.
My boyfriend is a groomsmen and the groom has chosen a suit that is $500. Am I the only one who thinks this is ridiculous?	Really you have no say in how he spends his money. $500 sounds about right for a decent suit. You can very easily spend upwards of that on a good suit. Not only that but a good tailored suit can make a man feel like a million bucks.	$500 is not that much for a decent suit. Can he not rent it out for a week or so?
Women of /r/askmen... do you feel welcome here?	Gonna chime in here, I find AW to be a more safer place place to post. Now and then I see racist and misogynist comments upvoted highly. I got a few hostile PMs from people here too, so this subreddit doesnt really feel much different than a default reddit. On the other hand, AW feels more civil and aware of social issues. To be honest, the way people describe AW feels totally inaccurate. It's not easy to get banned, and isn't a censorship-happy place. Just don't be an asshole and be a little more sensitive when commenting, it's not that hard.	It really depends on the topic and the post. Most of the guys here are really cool and seem very receptive to my two cents. I've been pleasantly surprised by the outreach I have gotten through comments and PMs. I like to think I'm a part of the community here, but there is sometimes this lingering feeling I'm an outsider looking in. In terms of hostility or feeling marginalized, I have a pretty thick skin. If I mention anything with regards to feminism, affirmative action, or dating being difficult for women, I know I'm not going to have a popular opinion. However, I genuinely enjoy the heated debates and even when we disagree, I find everyone respectful.
Do you text differently with girls you like vs girls you are friends with?	I generally don't text at all. Don't look for "subtle signals" or any sort of bullshit like that. If you like a guy, fucking ask him out or something.	Yes, the difference is that I'll rarely text a girl that im friends with. Compared to someone I'm attracted to, in which case I'll text more often. I hate texting, but if its someone I like, then its worth the effort to me. Can't say this applies to all guys, but I'm sure I'm not alone on this one.
My SO got beat up. What can I do to help?	Challenge him to a fight and then let him win that way he can re-establish dominance and stand proudly defiant to the world. It's the only way.	The majority of streetfights I've seen involve a blatantly stronger group suckerpunching, bumsrushing or otherwise ambushing a weaker group. Basically cowards who know they're very likely to win and wouldn't start the fight otherwise. Most people even with martial art training aren't likely to win in those circumstances. It sucks, but what can you do. Winning isn't as important as sticking up for yourself.
What's the line between nice and leading a guy on?	In my opinion, if a guy likes a girl it's his responsibility to ask her out (similarly if a girl is into a guy it's in her best interest to make her feelings known directly). Up to that point it's not your responsibility to do anything. Once you're asked out you need to be direct and final in your answer, don't try to soften the blow at all, just let him know you aren't interested in a romantic relationship. Most guys will ask a girl out before they're head over heals into her and can accept rejection stoically. The people who don't are the squeaky wheels that you hear about all of the time, but honestly as long as you don't end the friendship or treat him/her like some creepy perv for showing an interest they won't hold it against you or suffer any sort of excessive emotional damage.	I'm attracted to pretty girls that are nice to me. I also tend to be friends with girls that are nice to me. So if you're my friend, you're pretty, and you're nice to me and you're available, chances are I will ask you out. You're not doing anything wrong. These things just happen. When I think "leading someone on," it's generally more of a conscious decision to pretend to like someone in order to get attention/benefits/etc. Those people who do that are awful, like you said.
Am I out of line for not wanting my husband to spend time with a particular woman anymore?	I'd bet Money that they've done a lot more than spot each other at the gym already. Your husband and this chick have absolutely no respect for you at all and you sound like a pushover bcuz ur husband is comfortable as a Fuck to even dream of bringing this lady around you.	> Than she says in a flirty voice, "If I was his wife I would suck his dick everyday." over the line
Are men affected by media portrayals of *fit* bodies?	I think that men's "ideal standard" is actually more unrealistic than women's as /u/knuckldragger pointed out in his post. That's definitely true. However, does it *affect* us? I don't think it really does. Men's value in dating is heavily skewed toward their value as a provider, while women's value is heavily skewed towards physical attractiveness. I can only speak for myself, but I don't feel shitty about myself just because I don't look like G.I. Joe, or because there's a more muscular guy nearby. I stay in decent shape and I really feel no pressure to do any more than that, so I can't say I'm really "affected" by the media portrayals of men's bodies.	A little. But I'm more affected by the media's portrayal of men as mindless idiots who are constantly derailed by the slighted hint of sex.
[UPDATE] My boyfriend is a groomsmen and the groom has chosen a suit that is $500. Am I the only one who thinks this is ridiculous?	I am aghast that anyone would believe any J. Crew's products are worth more than $50, tops. Those guys should go to a real tailor.	It's one thing choosing a $500 dollar suit for yourself, but an entirely different one if someone else has to do the same.
Late-bloomers: Do you ever feel sad for missing out on "young love" and what it entails?	You missed out on what sex? That's all young love really boils down to. You're not gonna move into together, you're not taking trips together (most likely), you aren't going to clubs together, not old enough to drink somewhere, you can't do a lot of the things you can once you're dating in your twenties. I'll admit it was fun but I could've done without things like pregnancy scares, break ups, or those unbearable moments of seeing your ex somewhere and getting depressed because she's moved on. Trust me brother you didn't miss much.	I think you just have to accept that. There are probably a lot of other human experiences that you're missing out on too, and the people who got to have young love missed out on a lot of the great experiences you've had. Personally, I've never had sex, but I've been to over 30 countries and currently live in New York City (which I love, though maybe it isn't for you). Sure, it would be nice to have sex, and it probably would have been nice to have experienced awkward teen romance. I didn't. I can't undo that. But there's a lot more to my life than having missed that.
Guys, how do you handle a woman who wants you to slap/hit her during sex?	I've done it, but I've found that it's more or less impossible for me to respect them or take them seriously afterwards.	Probably ask a clarifying question "are you sure?" and proceed gently until she describes how hard. This isn't really my thing, but if she's into it, then I aim to please. Better to start off gently than to hit her too hard at the start I think.
Men who have had PIV: can I ask you this incredibly gross question?	I don't think that's what you're feeling. But even if it is, no, I've never noticed this in a decade plus of regular sex.	I have never noticed it. The penis, while, of course, sensitive, is not nearly as sensitive as fingers. The only times I have felt a turd in a girl has been when sticking fingers up her butthole.
Question from a loner: What do social people do all day?	i do what ever the fuck i want. i wanna stay in i sty in. i wanna go out i go out.	I wish this question had more responses. I'm trying to break out of being a loner, but I have no real experience being social and don't know what to consider normal.
Do you leave it in after you have sex?	No. I'm putting spermicide in the condom so I don't get hit with a sudden 18 year case of "children"	My ex used to always ask me to leave it in. She liked the feeling of it pulsing inside her. Often we'd just leave it in while cuddling / kissing until my erection subsided. There was always something really intimate about it that I liked.
What is the most ridiculous misconception you have ever heard about men?	Go to /r/askwomen, /r/TrollXChromosomes, /r/feminism and /r/womensrights. There are so many ridiculous, stupid, ignorant and sexist comments about men in those subreddits.	All these are so serious... jeez. The most ridiculous one I've heard was from a girl who thought that when men weren't erect, they just "rolled their penises up into a ball" that they kept in their underpants and that's what a "bulge" is.
If you saw a woman reading it, what book would make you instantly want to talk to her?	'k, this is gonna make me sound like a cheeseball, but the Bible. It's a good starting point for conversation for me, and some people really love to talk about their spirituality. I could ask 'em about what story they're reading, what church they go to, the whole gamut of small talk. I've actually done that to a few girls that seemed open to conversation. Usually goes well. Jesus is my wingman, broski.	Lolita. Just because, goddammit, that book is just insane, and I've never met anyone I could talk about it with.
How would you react if your SO did amateur porn?	>She says she gets off from the attention she gets Common trait of cheaters! Red flag for me. Dive into a conversation over this but dont lets these comments create a bias. Y'all need a serious talk	>About 3 months into the relationship, she stopped making videos and I didn't think anything of it. Today (year and a half into the relationship) she sent me one and said she was probably going to upload it. I don't know why, but it really is getting to me this time. This part would make me think that she once thought that the attention she got from me was satisfying her needs, but it's not enough anymore.
What was it like being smaller than the other guys in high school?	I hit my growth spurt height-wise in 7th and 8th grade. I was still *really* skinny, though. I "filled out" in 10th grade, I think. I went from like 140 lbs to 185 lbs and not in a bad way. I could also grow a beard by 10th grade. Have a full one now, but I shave it off every once in a while.	There is a lot of violence. You start to turn toward rapid escalation and whatever you can leverage. Suddenly you are that crazy guy instead of that little guy. If I hadn't grown a foot taller in HS I would have turned into American Vladimir Putin.
Men of Reddit, if you saw someone who you found really attractive but they were in a wheelchair would you still date them? If not, why?	Heyy im deink pics or it didnnt happen I bet youe really oretty id go on a wheelchair ride with yoy to anywhe tee	Sure, as long as she was cool with the fact that there might be a bit of a learning curve as far as some dating things are concerned.
How do I convince this guy I like that I am not trying to trick him when I tell him he is attractive?	Booze. I know what this guy is feeling. Booze will help him mellow out and get you into his pants.	If he's anything like me then he was never complimented by girls for most of his life. So to be suddenly getting compliments feels like its just a joke or insincere. To fix this is a combination of time, more compliments, and getting physical. Take the actions speak louder than words approach, but continue complimenting him. Cause a majority of guys are never told they are good looking.
How does a girl know when she's a starfish?	When someone tells them. (Un)fortunately most men won't tell women that they're bad in bed. I'm guessing it's because: * When a woman tells a guy he's bad in bed she can go out and find another partner in a month. 2 tops. * When a man tells a woman she's bad in bed he's probably not going to have sex for a while. A looooooong time. For some guys bad sex is better than no sex.	Do you ever take charge? Do you tell him what you want? Do you cling to him, squeeze him, scratch him, bite him? Wrap your legs around him? Do you run your hands through his hair? Eye contact? And yes, sex can be hard. I think a lot of guys and girls are bad in bed without realizing it. It's not just technique. It's also about knowing which techniques your partner likes, and that is pretty difficult sometimes, arguably the hardest part of the endeavor.
What is life like for an unattractive man?	Being conventionally unattractive has sort of been a blessing for me. Since I could never skate by on looks, I had to learn how to talk with women, develop interesting hobbies, educate myself, and become funny to be successful with women. Some of those skill translate well into other life skills like excelling at work and having the confidence to approach new people. And now that I am done with college, I have time for more personal development. I realized that the women who only place value on my apperance as the standard yes/ no are not people I want to associate with.	I never fully understood that I am ugly, my brother is good looking and what a difference that makes. Then we both got a job working at the same place on a contract. Hooooly shit was that depressing. Naively thinking she was talking to him because she was a friendly chatty person, then getting absolutely shut down for saying hello or smiling. By the receptionist. Or the girl at the sandwich shop. Or the barmaid. Or the person selling the train tickets. Or the people we worked with...wait a minute...is *everyone* treating him better than me? They are aren't they. Fuck.
I would never date a woman with children, is this a strange viewpoint?	I don't want kids at all personally. Not my own, not anyone else's. I find it interesting that of all the things males of today have given up in the name of "gender equality", they still insist on not wanting kids unless they come from their own loins. It's silly to me. That isn't what makes a man a father.	At your age, nothing wrong with that. As /u/nerdrowwilson1 stated, single moms in their 20s is an indication of poor decision making (not a universal rule, but a guideline). If you're still single as you get closer to my ago (40-ish), then you're gonna have to accept that single moms exist and cutting them out of your dating pool really cuts down on your pool size. My problem with single moms is they always say "kids come first". And I'm more than cool with that. Her responsibilities to her children is paramount in her life. But I don't want to take a back seat to a snot nosed little shit either. And there's nothing wrong with that too. We all have priorities.
New SO doesn't cum from sex, is this normal?	Lol to all the people saying this is "normal". I can't attest to the "deathgrip" stuff people are saying, but his behavior and how he handles it is not normal. It's completely socially awkward and you should just sit down with him and tell him what you want from sex and what he wants from it.	I'm actually 31 and exactly the same as this guy. I enjoy sex and blow jobs, but I have to use my hand to finish most of the time. I can cum from sex, but it takes like 30 minutes of pounding without a condom to get me there. >Are you really going to masturbate when there is a girl who wants to have sex with you in your bed? I personally wouldn't masturbate in bed next to my partner, I would more likely go do it in the bathroom or something. But unless you made it clear you wanted to have sex right then I wouldn't assume you did either.
Any guy heard of "the grapefruit technique"?	First you going to cut of ONE side of the navel. You take that side off then you take it to the other side and then you .... do the same thing. SO why not just say "cut the navels off"	I cannot begin to describe how quickly i would lose my erection if a girl sounded like that when giving me head.
Guys, what is the sexiest thing a girl has done to seduce you, either intentionally or unintentionally?	One of my Ex Girlfriends said to me in bed "Im not wearing any pants" my response was "What taken you so long mine were off minuets ago" she was straight on it like a car bonnet, and I dunnoh how I did it (probably the all night gaming sessions helped) but yeah, it was an all night experience...	After my girlfriend got off of work one day, we had the house to ourselves, so we were watching some movies together and whatnot, she got thirsty so we went to the kitchen. We'd already been goofing off a bit sexually, but when in the kitchen she tried to reach for something kind of high up and had to stand on her toes for it, and I don't quite understand what it was, she only had a blouse and her underwear on, but I pretty much lost it. Might have broken the cup. Maybe.
I'm about to give my 12 year old brother the sex talk. What do you wish you'd been told at that age?	Honestly, I feel like the talk should come from another male but if you're gonna go for it, go for it. He may already know a thing or two. When I was 12 I knew what sex was and that I needed condoms for it, I didn't exactly know the motions, or what a vagina actually looked like, I just knew sex was sticking my dick one. My friends all talked about getting "the talk" from their dads so instead of waiting I asked my old man. He said "Well, what do you not already know?" The only new thing he told me was not to let her parents catch you, they can try to get you charged with statutory rape.	* Practice with a condom by yourself long before you try and do it with a girl in the room. * Don't take, send, or keep naked pictures of yourself or other kids. * When jacking off vary your technique over the years and avoid the "death grip". * Don't be friends with other guys who play fast and loose with consent. * Girls who like sex aren't sluts, they're the ones you want to marry.
To men who are NOT in relationships and DON"T do FWB/casual sex-- how do you guys keep going?	Don't wanna seem inconsiderate or offensive, but if you are sexually frustrated, why don't you have casual sex? If a lack of sex is bothering you, wouldn't that be the thing to fix it? Forgive me if I am being very simplistic, I am a few years younger and not that experienced in that kind of thing.	I don't make having a relationship or finding someone to be with my reason for living. I just live my own life, do what I want. Sometime I wonder if I'm not enjoying my freedom a bit too much which might cause me to not get a girlfriend
Can someone please help me figure out what this guy is thinking??	SUBWAY. Healthy, tasty, and barely more expensive than buying the ingredients on your own to make your own sandwich. I never get anything more expensive than the $5 footlong [$5.75 here in Canada :( ]. Also, dem white chocolate chip macedamia nut cookies. Plus now they have spinach here (more healthy shit, fuck yeah).	Damn, I totally fell for the title and was about to begin another exasperated reply. I think it probably counts as fast food, but The Habit burger joint (If I remember correctly, it's mostly just here in California) is fantastic.
How did you get over betrayal for the first time?	I was never naive enough to think I was never going to get cheated on. I never believed any of my early gfs were going to be "the one". So it never held me back. Yeah, it sucked for a couple of days, but I've always had an easy time getting over breakups.	When I'm heart broken, I remind myself it's because I was able to let love in, and as much as the heart break sucks I can't close off my heart because I want to be a person who loves fully.
[Serious] Men, do you actually consider yourself attractive?	I could be worse looking, but I could also be better looking. We all have insecurities. When people have said I'm attractive in the past I've had some trouble believing it, but at the same time I realize I'm not awful to look at. edit: forgot a word.	Every now and then in the mirror I look at myself and then go, "Yeah, I'm pretty attractive." But the rest of the day I just completely feel like some fetid creature.
Do you think sexually about all women you spend time with? Do you intuitively form a sexual opinion about all women upon meeting them?	No, not in ANY context. It depends. If the woman is attractive, then yes, no matter how fleeting the interaction, I instantaneously think sexually about her. If the interaction is long and/or recurrent, I will, almost subconsciously, make up my mind about a woman sexually. So long as she is within an age range. If a woman is over 40, only exceptionally beautiful women strike my fancy. If I am in a relationship, the mental activity regarding other women does tend to simmer down as long as the relationship is happy. Generally, I think that my mental activity regarding women and sex is hardwired and subconscious. When it comes to particularly attractive women, it bubbles up, and it is difficult to not think about how badly I want them.	There are two different things here; noticing whether a woman is attractive or not, and actively thinking about her sexually (like fantasizing about her, or even a quick thought of "wow, I'd like to fuck her"). Seeing a woman and noticing whether she's attractive just seems natural and automatic. Seeing her and *not* noticing whether she's attractive is about as alien to me as going outside and *not* noticing whether it's raining or not, meaning that it's pretty rare. Actively thinking about women sexually is different. It's an actual action that you do, not simply something that you passively notice. It's going to happen for fewer women (depending on their attractiveness, what other things are occupying your mind, whether you're single, etc.).
Have you ever manipulated someone into loving you?	I was really in love with this girl but she wasn't feeling new so i told her I'd take her v card without catching feelings. 3 years later, were in bed naked right now and still together	...isnt that how it sorta works? Or do you mean on purpose? I tried as hard as hell to get my girlfriend to fall for me, and I think its worked because. Um. Girlfriend. I really do love her and i didnt do anything malicious like lie, but some days I still worry that I manipulated her in a bad way
Do you ever get drunk alone with someone of the opposite sex while in a relationship?	Yes. Why wouldn't I? Is the implication behind the question that I (or you) cannot control yourself when drunk and will pounce on any friend in the vicinity?	I basically don't do anything that I think would bum my SO out if she knew about it. That's the only real guideline i have.
[Serious] What is a stereotype/misconception that you have to deal with on a regular basis that really pisses you off?	I can't do anything nice for a female without it being sexist or because I want to get laid. I am an asshole simply because I don't care to make small talk (meaningless conversation) just to talk to someone. If you want to converse, pick a topic. I am not here to entertain you just so you can fuck off at work. I'm either gay or something is wrong with me because I can't fathom why someone would want to put up with a female in their life. I am sorry I don't see the benefit of someone nagging or bitching about meaningless shit. Yes, there are women that don't do these things however I have yet to see a relationship where that is true.	Black guy here. * Can't dance. * Can't sing. * Can't rap * Can't play basketball * Am not hood. * Am not "Stephon Urk-el" Someone please tell my co-worker that. It's starting to get annoying.
Has AskMen become AskHighSchool ?	Not a man, love this Reddit though. Maybe you are growing up? Gasp! I promise not to tell. You may find a deeper satisfaction I'm askmen30. I go there for serious type questions. Not knocking you guys here at all. You are great for what you do. :)	I fucking hate the homework assignment Mr. Hamilton gave us. What the fucking fuck has fucking learning about fucking Egypt gonna fucking do to fucking help me in fucking life. Fucking fucker of a fuck. But no, man, what gave you that idea?
Have you ever cock-blocked someone deliberately?	All the time when I see some douchebag hitting on one of my friends. Usually I come from behind, give her a kiss on the cheek and say "Who is this guy, sweetheart?" Why am I doing this? Because I'm a douchebag myself and I don't feel empathy for other dudes. It is fun, faces these guys are making are fuckin priceless. Also, my female friends seem to like it. Situation like this led to hookup twice (it wasn't my goal, we just got carried away I guess)	My friend cockblocks me for fun. I set him up with a girl and he's now over 3 years with her. I told him once he could repay the favour and all he does is throw me on the deep end. 'This is my friend packs, and he likes bukkake' and 'Who's your female friend? Will she be having breakfast with us tomorrow?' are not something you shout out when I'm talking to a girl!
Would you date a woman who posted naked pictures of herself on the internet?	This thread sucks, you'll use their service, but don't respect them for doing it. How is this not wrong. It's a job, just like any job it can fuck with you. It doesn't turn every sex worker into some shady self loathing narcissist. I would and have dated sex workers. It's about who they are, not where they work.	Before we were in the relationship, I probably wouldn't mind. During the relationship I'd probably have a problem with it.
What are the most destructive ideals we teach girls?	ITT: no real ideals mentioned, just angry men projecting. No girl is taught to be passive and virtuous. She's just not attracted to you. A "man hater" feminist is just a girl who's not attracted to your xenophobic, insulated, backward, Midwestern ways. Also: parents do not teach their little girls "the lie that women earn 70% of what men earn for the same job".	I think the most destructive thing we teach girls is that to be passive is virtuous. To wait for the man. To be a follower, not a leader. It breeds weakness and entitlement both. Edit: Thanks for the gold, gracious stranger. :)
My lovely boyfriend[22M] talks to his mother 5-6 times a day on average, is this normal for you guys?	Who cares if it's normal, if it isn't affecting you/the relationship in a negative way I don't see the issue.	Normal? Not by any means. If the closest person he's had his whole life is his mother, then if he ever gets excited about something I don't see it being out of the ordinary to contact her about it. If it's a problem or not stems on how potentially invasive she is (if she's attempting to be controlling or anything) but if it's just him going to the person he's close to, then it's no different then me being excited to tell my best friend about something. Although the frequency can be considered weird, but again if it doesn't bug you, no harm no foul.
How do you feel about a girl who laughs during sex?	Not sexy. It's like you're putting this distance in a form of humor between what is happening and your idea of yourself because you can't fully accept it as is. Like you were finding it kinda silly. I prefer the classic, joking-is-over, fierce intensity.	Given your comment for your main post, laughing is fine. personally I'd love a little more humor when I'm getting busy. I'm also pretty sure I've been the chattier one for each girl I've been with. Not sure how I feel about that part.
Why would you stay friends with a rapist if you knew what he had done (and knew it really did happen)?	Nope, never. The rub of it, though, is that innocent til proven guilty. If we strung up every guy accused of rape, we'd be left with Pope Francis and a bunch of screamingly obvious gay men. EDIT: I'm not saying rape isn't a serious issue, I'm saying if I don't know, I've no business second guessing. Once it's known and convicted slam dunk, dude's so written off.	Fuck no. I would have cut them off from my life instantly. Especially since you even showed proof and it wasn't a pure he said/she said situation.
What's a bad habit you're trying to break?	Masturbation. My religion believes it to be a sin, I feel guilty about doing it while in a serious relationship, and I would save a ton of money on lotion if I could stop. When I fail at quitting that, I'll try to break my habit of cussing, which I only do at work. GD the culture around these parts.	I have a bad habit of settling. I'll start learning something new or exercising more, then I'll just go "eh, good enough" and start to slack off
Do any men actually find heels attractive?	I think heels make women walk funny, and in general are not sexy. Exception: Heels, long long legs with really short skirt, patterned mesh stockings or really long sox. And a simple sleeveless loose top, revealing the midriff. No bra. dancing equals sexy	Yes, I think they can make a girl look more attractive. But it's not very attractive if you can barely walk when you're wearing them.
Is it off-putting if a woman suggests going dutch or splitting the bill on a first date?	Not to me. I actually insist on that anyway, which frightens away a lot of prostitutes who think they are classy women.	Absolutely not, it means you're financially independent and aren't just expecting to freeload a meal out of me. But if someone still insists on paying, they want to treat you, so I wouldn't continue pushing in that case.
Men who currently date, or have dated a black girl, have you ever had problems from black men?	Lots of black women get angry at black men who date outside their race. The main two groups of people who have the highest percentage not in a relationship are black women and Asian men. So when a black guy, especially one with his life together goes outside of their race it's seen as being a race traitor.	Whitey here, been married to a black woman for 4 years. I can count the number of times she's been approached by a black man in front of me on one hand, and even fewer times did they mention my ethnicity. She's taller than me, that gets mentioned more often than our races. BTW White man/Black woman couples have the lowest divorce rate of any mixed ethnicity combo.
What has been your most disillusioning life experience as a man?	I was in Amsterdam with a group of Jewish friends. We went to an improv comedy show that was in English. The actors on stage asked the audience for "Funny confessions" that they could act out on stage. One guy yells out, "I killed a thousand Jews!!!". The audience laughed! The actors actually went through with it and turned it into some sort of Hitler/Holocaust joke. We got up and walked out. It was the first time in my life I really, truly understood how many otherwise civilized people out there hate me for literally no reason other than being born.	Getting out of the military and realizing how little America cares about its veterans. I don't just mean the shittiness of the VA. When you go look for a job, they'll ask you if you have any 'real experience' (apparently leading 40 men with $10 million worth of equipment into combat isn't quite as important as being an intern).
What's the worst a woman has done to you on a date?	Was a feminist broke down what it means to be a woman in this day and age and how hard it was to be woman. Proclaimed that women deserve equality and can do anything just as good as a man can. I of course was elated at this news. When the waitress gave us the bill I handed her the bill and said women deserve equality and can do anything just as good as a man can. That is when she said she didn't bring any cash with her cause it was the first date and men should pay. Of course I raged on the inside and paid the bill.	I'm a 5'5" guy and I went on a date with a 5'8" girl. The entire night she kept saying stuff like "Oh my god you are SO short!" and "Does it suck for you, trying to find girls at your height?" Yeah, that was a fast evening.
What are some SEXIST attitudes women hold without knowing?	Depends what you mean by sexist. According to feminists men can't experience sexism. Edit: Whoa, whoa, I didn't invent feminism, I'm just telling you what they believe.	I'd like to add the assumption that women are these complex and mysterious creatures which are impossible to understand. Similarly men are simple and only need their basic needs covered. I suppose it's perpetuated by both sexes but it has bugged me for a long time.
My younger sister is becoming extremely promiscuous. How am I meant to handle the situation?	Stop slut shaming your sister. CIS-HET PATRIARCHAL SHITLORD No but seriously, nothing you can do. Let her be a drip-dry whore for all you give a fuck.	If I were you, I'd actually focus my worry less on the promiscuity itself (because yeah, she has the right to fuck who she wants), and I'd be a little more worried about anything underlying all of this behavior, drinking included. It's possible that she's feeling lonely, or having self-esteem problems, or something. OR maybe she just loves to fuck/get male attention. Regardless, it might be worth saying, "Hey sis, I support you no matter what, and I just want to let you know if there is anything you ever want to talk about, I'm here for you. I hope life is going well for you." Maybe that'll open up an avenue for her to talk, and if it doesn't, there isn't much you can or should do.
Single men, how often do you go out by yourself? Women, how do you view men alone versus in a group?	As a man, when you go out alone it's possible to be left alone except when you want someone to interact with. That's not really true of most women. Similarly, if I go to a bar & get toasty alone, I don't have to worry about getting hit on, drugged, or for the most part taken advantage of while blacked out. Being a man is like having a super power.	I would be way more willing to approach a guy on his own than in a group. I see a group as, "We came here together to enjoy each others company, not yours." And, a person solo as "I wanted to go out and socialize, just didn't have anyone to do so with tonight." But, I probably see it that way because that's how I am about going out solo. Even if I'm in a group, I'm happy to meet new people :) Edit: I need to stop using voice to text, or check it well afterwards.
Single men in your 30s, how does your average weekend compare to your average weekend when you were in your 20s?	34 here. In my 20's I spent my weekends working during the day and hanging out with friends at night. In my 30's I'm very much into my career and often spend time working part of Saturdays. But I love my career so it's fine with me. In the evenings I hang out with my wife and we usually go to a movie or meet up with another married couple. So not much changed except 6 days a week I'm awake from 5am to 10pm. I'm happy with it really and I love spending time with my family.	Instead of going out on Fridays and Saturdays I only go out one night. And I spend the entire next day in the fetal position because I haven't learned how to drink for my age.
Would you be upset if your SO still wore jewelry from a previous relationship?	Heart ring? Yeah, don't do that. Actually, i would personally prefer that anyone i was involved in got rid of stuff from previous SOs entirely, but i guess that might be a bit extreme. Mementos are big fucking no though. If it has special meaning, it would upset me.	I don't really care. I still wear the clothes that my exgirlfriend bought me. I'm not going to throw away gifts from an old lover, and I certainly don't expect her to either. I'm not going to freak out about jewelry unless it's like a pendant with his face in it.
If you could go back and enjoy your 20's what would you differently?	I would not have smoked weed. From the age of 15 - 20 i was smoking every day for most of the day. It took me over 5 years to rebuild my confidence and social skills. I still suffer from anxiety issues.	As a 21 yo guy going through the comments, I think I should reconsider what I'm doing with my life right now.
Have you ever lost your SO's trust?	I cheated on my girlfriend with my best friend. We talked, fought, and broke up. We both admitted to playing a roll in the break up and realized we loved each other to much to end it after a month. Plot twist: it's been 2 years and not only are we doing amazing but they're actually best friends now.	Telling your SO you quit smoking isn't the best idea if you're a 2 pack a day smoker. Long term I'd say that her finding out about it was the biggest factor in our breakup.
How can I sexually attract men without making things awkward?	1. be attractive, don't be unattractive, 2. take initiative, aka, talk to someone you like and bring out some moves, 'let's go out for a drink' works, 3. like a guy? smile at him and make eye-contact. wait for him to approach and start convo, rinse and repeat.... \*1: Sorry to say this, but losing weight (if required) and dressing up in a feminine, well-fitting clothes manner goes here. (and this isn't 100% sexist. same applies to no-luck guys too: lose weight, gym and dress better is step 1 advice to guys too...)	You may look innocent or give off that vibe, which is really not a bad thing. The average guy who finds out that you look sweet but like to get freaky, he's gonna be ecstatic. If you do give off that vibe though, guys are gonna feel awkward about trying to sexualize you, at least in public. You may have to simply become more brash, when you find a guy you like then chase him and take what you want.
If men get paid more than women, why don't all companies just hire women?	Because men don't get paid more(in some places it's the opposite though) ever read that article about the tv producer who decided she would have an ll-female team? shit closed down within a year leaving her broke.	That statistic doesn't control for the type of job. Women, in many cases, take lower paying jobs like retail and service positions. These jobs pay less for everyone, but because the proportion of women that work them is higher compared to men the overall wage for their gender looks like they get paid less. I've never heard of anyone saying there's a widespread problem with women making significantly less than men *in the same job.*
Men in their 30s, what advice would you give to 25 - 29 year olds?	If you haven't figured it out by 28, you're probably not gonna figure it out at the magical age of 32 or whatever 30 number.. By 25 you should pretty much have shit squared away.	Stop treating girls like they're special before they actually are. This isn't to say that girls aren't special, but a girl shouldn't be special *to you* until you have a relationship with her. I spent too many years of my life pining after girls I wasn't dating and who wouldn't date me if I asked. Date first, then find out if they're special or not.
Men, how do I flirt?	I always think flirting is just talking about other stuff when you both understand that you wanna fuck. Obviously it's not quite as black and white as that but that's it at it's simplest. Anything more than that could still be flirting (like actually talking about wanting to fuck) but in my opinions you are more into "hitting on" territory there.	Make her laugh, but don't be a clown or comedian. Poke fun at her (not negging but playful teasing), easy things would be their hometown or college they attended. Don't straight up insult them, I'm only stressing this because some people like to take advice too literally. Make physical contact when it's acceptable and appropriate. Don't grab your coworker's ass and come back here whining about why you got slapped and fired. Don't send those kind FB messages again. Yikes. In fact, I steer clear of FB messages in general. If I'm not comfortable texting a girl, I'm definitely not telling her she's beautiful via FB message.
Is society failing boys and young men?	Early 20's here, welll adjusted, in a stable and happy relationship, generating a good career. Society isn't failing young men. Young men and boys are failing themselves, but this isn't news. Young men have been failing since we were hunter gatherers. It's the whole point of men as a gender, we have to compete amongst ourselves because a fraction of us are going to get left behind in the genetic tide. The difference now is that the guys that would have just been pushed to the edges of society have a number of different forums to ask for help and improve themselves and their standing. You don't ever see posts saying: "Guys, I row crew, have a hot girlfriend and made it into Yale! Help?!" because they don't need to post. They made it already, you'll just never read about it online.	We didn't have the option to go online and ask all these questions. We had to nut up or shut up. If I'd had the resources that are available now, I would've used 'em. I'd be on reddit going 'What's the difference between head and a blow job?' and I'd probably get a better answer than the one I got in grade 5. Which was 'Head is like a blow job but better.' *nodding* 'Ok'
How would you respond to a female friend asking you for mutual masturbation?	No, the fuck do I want a handjob for? She can DJ Diddles herself. I'll be fucking, because I'm an adult.	I actually straight up had a friend ask me to finger her once. I was over in her room and she eventually just was like "hey, I'm really horny, can you finger me? And then not be weird about it after?" It was chill. 10/10, would finger again. Still remain great friends.
UPDATE: I've just started letting my SO sleep with other women. Should I worry that it will affect his feelings for me?	Why on earth would you willingly accept such an arrangement? Don't you have any agency or self respect? If my girlfriend insisted on sharing I'd be out of there in a heartbeat.	> He didn't feel much of a connection and apparently wasn't interested in sleeping with her without it. As a woman who has browsed reddit a lot I was almost as disbelieving as you are. I don't find that hard to believe at all. I think you've been reading the wrong parts of Reddit.
Found Tinder running on my BF's phone. How should I handle this?	Check his messages and see if any are current. Sometimes people just forget about it, or they just like to see who is interested in them. I have since deleted my dating apps since "being taken off the market"	How about "So, I'm worried about something I saw on your phone when I was killing the GPS app... I found Tinder. What do you with that app? Do I need to be concerned with anything?" I guess knowing how long you have been dating might help context a bit.
Have you ever gone to bed with a girl and then been shocked or put off by something once the clothes came off? Did either of you mention it at any point and how did you both react?	Wow, people can be douchey. It really doesn't matter. You wouldn't date someone for their car, right? So why would anyone pick a partner spirit based on their body? It's just a vehicle for the soul, man.	I once had a surprise with a skinny girl. I took off her bra to find no boobs. What I thought were her boobs were total padded bras. Her nipples were adult feminine, but she was truly flat chested. She completely made up for it with a vag of perfection, sexual enthusiasm and action, and no fear/shame of me playing with what boobage she did have.
Fathers who originally were indifferent to having children (or straight out didn't want any), how do you now feel about being a father?	I do not have children but your post remembers me of something I witnessed: A woman at the very end of her 30 complained that her husband is still not into the idea to get children. She said that he already said that he does not want any 10+ years ago but she can't understand why he still does not want any because she was so sure that he is going to change his mind. All her female colleagues joined in blame him for that.	I wanted no kids and the wife wanted 3, so we "compromised" and had 1. I love my daughter; she's awesome. I'm told I'm pretty great dad, but I still feel like I've made plenty of mistakes and will, very likely, make many more. Having my own hasn't made my like kids any more. If anything, seeing how polite my own is has made me even more cynical when it comes to the common child. They're all just... rude and selfish.
What is the point of a strip club? Is it really worth it to spend a shitton of money just to be frustrated?	Strip clubs are fun in a group. Don't get suckered into the champagne room, spend less than a few hundred tipping out the main stage and a few lap dances. Then get out and hit the club/bar for some skanks to get your D wet for real. It's the appetizer round.	I only go to strip clubs with a group of friends. Normally, some guys and some girls. We are all drunk and just looking to have a good time. And honestly, do you get blue balls just every time you get an erection or something? You know you don't have to get a dance if you don't want to.
Do you feel like modern dating problems are due to men being taught to respect women, but not how to court them?	Man, I read your post, and you have a lot of responses, but I feel the need to point out some things about your language that might be worth thinking about. You talk about wanting a mate and wanting to "woo" women. You sound like some kind of national geographic special where the male shows his plumes to attract a mate. Seriously, just be yourself, whether I'm a guy that wants to be your friend or a girl that wants to get to know you, be yourself.	Decreased social interaction = less time developing social skills. Higher exposure to perfect TV social interaction = association with their actions being correct = incorrect application of social skills to real life situations.
Barbers, what's something customers do that annoys you? What can we do to stop that?	edit: Sorry guys, I'm retarded, I wasn't thinking about where I was. That said, she cuts my hair so I don't go to a Barber but I suspect they'd expect a tip as well? My GF is a hair stylist. If she works on your hair for 4 hours a 10 dollar tip is insulting. edit: Obviously no one here understands how the hair stylist industry, primarily doing women very lengthy processes and treatments, work. I'm the idiot though, this is askmen, who cares what a female stylist wants.	Know what you want done before you go in, and when they ask explain it in detail, even better bring a picture.
Any men put on a lot of muscle and realize a huge difference in how people treat you?	Yes, women are very shallow. Same experience here. A guy will talk to nearly any woman who decides to speak to him. A woman cries creep and tries to GTFO out of a conversation if she's not instantly attracted to the guy.	I'm not big by any means (yet), but I used to look like I escaped from Auschwitz. Look in my post history if you're curious. I've noticed more looks from girls since they don't outweigh me. Also get a lot less shit from friends since they don't all out-muscle me anymore.
How do you measure intelligence in someone?	For me, if someone exhibits any of the following traits, I automatically assume they're an idiot... * Religious * Racist in any way, shape or form * Homophobic * Likes guns * Won't try any sort of food outside their comfort zone * Thought Final Fantasy XIII was a good game UPDATE: Thought of two more... * Watches college football and roots for a specific team, but in games not involving their team, just blindly roots for teams from a certain conference (i.e., "Sure, Ohio State isn't playing in this here bowl game, but I'm gonna root for Wisconsin because I'm a Big Ten fan!") * Went to Ohio State.	Intelligent people are critical of their thoughts, when they speak (casually, not making a speech) it's evident that they have taken other perspectives on the subject and the possible counter-arguments into consideration.
Have you ever been completely oblivious to a woman's signs of interest? What was the story? When did you finally pick up on it?	I have a feeling that this thread will be abused to give comfort: "Oh.... so maybe she was into me all along, I just never realized it." The problem with not realizing that a woman was interested in you is that you did not realized it. So you can not report it here. In conclusion, I think that many stories here will be fed with fantasy, at least to a certain degree.	She said "take a shot and I will kiss you". I said "Nah, I'm good." Then turned and walked away. My friend's face who was standing right there was priceless and almost worth it.
Any other mid-20's men feeling left out and tired of people settling down?	It is rough stuff. But I priomise you you made the correct decision. Wait 5-7 years and half the people you know will already be divorced. Imagine how awesome it'll be for you to be in your 30s with a career, money in the bank, no debts and no baggage from a failed marriage. The grass is always greener, but your doing it right!	You're still a very young man, but your post almost sounds like someone my age, (63), sadly lamenting about having lived a life wasted on poor choices and bad decisions. I don't know how tied down to your job you are, how passionate you are about your work, or how flexible it allows you to be. I do know that if you want to spend a month on the sun drenched beaches of Thailand, or Bali there is nothing to prevent you from enjoying that experience. Believe me, as someone who started a family *very* young, there are many things you can do that your married friends cannot, and the options dwindle rapidly when kiddies start pitter-pattering into your life. I guess I'm just trying to point out that there are many, huge advantages to being single, young, healthy and free! The only limits are those you impose on yourself.
I called my SO's penis by accident, and I am mortified. Do you think this would affect him in any way?	Bring up in conversation: 'My friend (a friend of OP in case) said she was dating this guy with a small dick, so I told her I was so lucky to have you' Something like that. Wrap it up casually, he'll probably feel good both about you thinking he is good and others knowing it too.	His change of subject *may* be an indication that he did hear you, pretty much knows you didn't mean it *that* way, but still kind of bothered him despite knowing that because culturally such a deal is made of it for men, but this, but but that... Just avoid doing it again and casually compliment him to the opposite effect some time soon. Try not to make it too obvious or overdo it.
Please be honest, what is it like to go down on a girl?	Boring. Hot, sweaty,slobbery. Cant breath, taste is meh. The stubble rubs like sand paper on my tongue lips and face. Eve. On a shaved girl there is always a few missed strands of hair too and that grosses me out. I really don't get the appeal of going down on a girl.	We need a FAQ for this. It comes up again, and again, and again. I would not buy pussy flavored candy or ice cream. However, I *love* to eat pussy knowing my SO is enjoying it. I *love* bringing her to orgasm using only mouth. It makes me feel like I''m an all-powerful sex god.
If a woman can't cook, is that a deal breaker?	It's important that she has big breasts so she can feed my children well. Cooking is not too important in comparison. She can learn to cook. She's got many years to improve.	I view it as a plus. I love cooking, and I hate it when my partners get in the way when I'm in the kitchen. I hate when my pans get ruined, and when my knives get treated treated wrong I get a shiver down my spine. So get the hell out of my kitchen. Open the bottle of wine to breathe. The risotto will be ready in twenty minutes.
Opinions on Emma Watsons HeForSHe speech?	I don't have any real issue with what she said, but I do wonder why was it needed to be said? The Feminism topic needs to go away, everyone is sick of hearing about it and it has become so skewed by different messages that its basically meaningless. The whole movement is more negative than positive. Her trying to reintroduce people to it is just not necessary. We don't need to hear more about it and it absolutely doesn't need celebrity endorsement. She should be focusing on something more essential, world starvation, spread of AIDS, environmental issues, not third wave feminism in western countries.	I'm not too aware of any places in particular for men to discuss not fitting in with the traditional male stereotypes, but I've not really looked for any. There's certainly not a culture of men discussing problems like this though - traditionally they'd be told to 'man up' or the like which doesn't help anyone. If you look at how statistically males are more likely to commit suicide, there's certainly a basis that men should be able to discuss mental health issues without fear of being stigmatised.
What's your favourite video game and why?	The original Half Life. I have every step, every spawn, every boss, every gun location committed to memory. It was my first computer game. I had the old school SEGA genesis before my parents got a computer and bought me HL. The N64 came next with OoT. Gaming was my childhood.	Age of Empires II for PC. Along with the expansion packs. Fun to play vs. the PC (sometimes it was torrentially good, sometimes it was horrendously inept) and it had a great (at the time) multiplayer.
Do you have to be completely over an ex to start dating again?	How else am I going to forget that person unless I find someone to "cover up" all of those old negative feelings?	Really depends on what you mean by getting over her. If you've gotten past the desire to be with her and you understand that you will never date her again, then you're ready to date someone new.
What are things that ladies should know about attracting a guy?	This is a disingenuous question. Ladies know how to get a guy. It's easy. What you're really asking is "what should ladies know about attracting a top tier guy?"	If you want to attract a guy's attention in a group setting: * Make it less of a group setting by pretending he is the only one there. That being said, don't attach yourself to him like a leech. * Initiate and continue the conversation. There is no reason the guy needs to be the one who will carry the conversation If the two of you are alone: * Eyes, eyes, eyes. Make eye contact. Don't stare into them all the time, that's creepy, but like 75/25 ratio. * Make some kind of contact: arms, hands, back, hair. If you want to send a really clear message, hold his hand.
My wife has attempted suicide several times over the years. I am thinking it is time to leave her and try to start my life over. I know she will kill herself if I divorce her. What do I do?	Walk away, if she kills herself so be it, ultimately there is little you can do and it's unfair you don't get to live your life.	If I were you it would discuss this with her psychiatrist and work towards a plan to get her into a live-in therapy program. During that program I would ask for the divorce. She needs serious help and monitoring this does not seem like the job for someone she visits once a week.
Men, how long did it take you to get over your ex? How did you do it? How long were you guys together?	Depends on the ex. Longest was like 3 weeks. Normal is two/three days, or whatever is closest to the weekend. What do you mean how? I stopped caring and slept with other people. Never had a relationship longer than 4 months.	It honestly took a couple of years. We were together for 4 years and I had already bought the ring. I just focused on bettering myself mainly. Learned a bunch of weird interesting hobbies/skills such as: lock picking, fencing, ballroom dancing, tae kwon do, racket ball etc... Really buckled down in school, studied hard improved my grade and got accepted into a great postgrad professional school. Got involved in clubs. Worked out. Volunteered. And I slowly started to realize hey. I'm an interesting guy who has a lot going for him. And each day I hurt less and less then one day I woke up and didn't hurt anymore. Soon after that I met my current girlfriend who is an amazing woman.
For those that prefer thin girls, what is it that you like?	Thin girls to me are like 185 lbs lol. I'm sitting at a strong 220 lbs and a 185 lb girl is nothing to me.	I prefer small breasts, actually am turned off by big breasts, and thinner tend to have smaller breasts. I prefer smaller or at least tighter asses and bigger girls tend to have looser flabbier butts. Also long lean thin legs are better when wrapped around me
Is your girlfriend/wife funny?	>I see a lot on /r/AskMen[1] that women aren't "lmao-rofl" funny like guys. They aren’t. It is exceedingly rare. However, my ex-girlfriend was unusually funny. She could actually make me laugh out loud. That is rare for me. I really prized that in her. Edit: Wow, r/ask(premenstrual)women really leaked on this one!	Funny in that she says things that make me laugh - no. Funny in that she's a gigantic goofball, who is so silly she sends *herself* into gigglefits that in turn crack me up - 100% yes.
If a woman tells you you're attractive or starts hitting on you, do you ever assume it's some kind of prank or otherwise not genuine even if it is?	"...I simply cannot know if I'm attractive..." You can get feedback from /r/rateme. What women find physically attractive varies pretty widely.	If a girl is that direct about it, I don't get as suspicious as opposed to when she is just acting generally flirty. If a girl who otherwise ignores me when we're together starts talking to me like she loves me I can almost guarantee I'm about to get asked if I can do something, give a ride, sell something, etc. It really irks me and makes me want to be like "bitch, you never talk to me ever now you want a ride and you think I'm the chump who is going to do it for you because you are being flirty with me all of a sudden?" It really just depends on my mood at that point. I don't have any standard reaction, sometimes I do what they are asking, sometimes I politely say no and sometimes I'm a dick about it.
Would it bother you if your girlfriend let it slip that her last boyfriend was very well endowed?	That would be like your girlfriend being upset with you because your ex had way larger breasts than her. If it bothers you, so be it. But it's not a thought worth vocalizing because absolutely nothing fruitful can come from that conversation/argument.	Yes, of course. I am well endowed myself, so I have a high threshold for getting insecure about it. But no matter how big or small you are, a statement like that obviously implies that he was bigger. I would bet most girls wouldn’t love it if their boyfriend "let it slip" that his last girlfriend had really spectacular tits. "Oh, yours are great too, honey. Hey, I’m with you, right? So obviously I like your tits. Really, really, really gorgeous tits aren’t the most important thing to me. What matters is that the girl knows how to use them!"
What is the Worst Thing a Women Can Say to Kill the Mood?	"Fuck that feels so good" -me "Yeah, I've had LOTS of practice" -her response I then proceeded the think about how many other dicks have been in her mouth.	Honestly, I slept with this one woman who would ask 'why?' during sex. She'd ask me to talk dirty, then follow my statements with why? Such a headfuck and a moodkiller.
Women of AskMen, what are some things you learned about the opposite sex from this subreddit?	Maybe that they should not give advice in AM because they aren't men. But I'm a guy, so, you know... I can.	I've been astonished to discover from this sub and Reddit in general that men are pretty much just as self-conscious about their bodies and how they are perceived by the opposite sex as women are. It also never occurred to me before just how terrifying it is for a man to approach a woman in a bar or club or elsewhere. I've never been mean to guys who approach, but reddit has made me very much more conscious of how much a guy is putting himself out there just to come over and talk to me--and I've been trying to be the initiator more (it's goddamned hard, though, I nearly peed my pants the first time I approached a cute guy a few weeks ago).
What has been your biggest "fuck you /r/askmen" moment?	Recently the thread about the girl who pretended to be a British tourist and had sex with a guy. Everyone was acting like "that's so terrible you did something awful". What's the big fucking deal?	This sub has a habit of someone asking a question, then downvoting all answers that are honest. For example, a girl will ask, "do men really care what a girls nipples look like?" and everyone who answers, "No all women's nipples are beautiful." while anyone who says they do in fact prefer one kind or type over another gets blasted...
Do you like smart girls?	If you're in high school, you don't have the slightest clue whether you're really intelligent or not. Take your condescension somewhere else.	Yeah, of course. I don't think anyone here would say being an intellectual is a bad thing. I know a close friend who values a great conversationalist over most other things in a SO. Two things: * Don't be condescending. * Be all ears when someone talks. Not just the guy you're interested in.
Is being falsely accused of rape something that you worry about on the regular?	Never have, never will. I've only seen men on Reddit overly concerned about this. This is another one of those "Reddit only" things. Like women hitting men, "man hating" feminists, people thinking a BMW is some exotic "rich man's car" and anyone who drives one is a terrible driver, and of course: moms glaring at single men who are in the vicinity of a child.	Yes, but more in the context of "Man, I generally hope that doesnt happen." When I actually think of the individual women that I have been involved with in my life, I am almost positive none of them would ever do something like that.
Do you treat pretty women differently than ugly women ?	Due to bullying, I have an inner hate for conventionally attractive women (or women I'm attracted to), so I tend to try not to talk to them at all. Any time I do occasionally talk to them they are just too confident, usually up themselves and a bit arrogant. "Ugly" women? In my experience these women are very nice and usually have everything I look for in a relationship but even if I don't look for a relationship (hasn't happened yet I'm 17 and cba), they are more friendly and are better friends. So I don't treat ugly girls better, just in my experience they are better people than good looking girls. edit: inb4 all the good looking girls and shallow guys downvote me	So I was in a restaurant. I noticed two women and a man at the ice cream area. The man gets himself a scoop of ice cream, the 2 women are waiting their turn. The woman that was next, was very pretty. Conventionally attractive. The man looks at her and then offers to get her scoop for her. After he gets her scoop, its the other womans turn. She was much less pretty and heavier. She looks at him, I can tell,shes expecting the same offer. The man hands her the scoop and walks off. All i thought was ouch...
American men, in our current, social environment, of sometimes heated discussion over domestic violence and sexual harassment, do you sometimes feel like the enemy?	Sounds like *your* issue. Grow up. I treat my fellow man and woman well and I don't have some subconscious belief that my gender is evil or owes anyone anything. > makes me far less likely to approach women for fear of being labeled a harasser Now you're worried others share your irrational belief and will judge you from its perspective. I don't mind if crazy people think *I'm* crazy; I don't expect them to understand me. I'm a great fucking dude, I assume women are stroked when I give them attention. I don't harass them, I don't even care enough to waste the energy it would take to harass someone. But I'll talk to a women if I want to and I assume she's glad I did, the second I thought otherwise I'd just say goodbye and cruise on my way.	Every time I read "Teach Men not to Rape/ Harass/ Threaten Women." I know I'm not the problem (aside from not really doing anything to fix it, since there's not much I can do), but there are some feelings that can't be avoided. As proof, look how much of modern feminism is about "Not all women are x, don't group women as a single group, etc."
I want to start approaching (more) girls, but the thought of being judged by my peers as pathetic/a loser/a failure for rejection makes me terrified. Thoughts?	No no no! Rejection is NOT a bad thing. It's almost a good thing. Even though it would be nice to snag every girl you see out there, rejection should give you the motivation to keep going. You should treat it with the lowest amount of fucks possible. Oh she rejected me? That's cute, hey look, there's an even more beautiful girl across the room from me. Rejection can save you a lot of time and heartbreak down the road too if the girl turns out to be really incompatible even in your first interaction. You have to change your perspective, it should be almost funny, the worse of a rejection they give you, the more entertained you should be by it. You gotta think you deserve every girl out there, and your friends are the losers for not having the balls to do approaches of their own!	> I want to start approaching (more) girls, but the thought of being judged by my peers as pathetic/a loser/a failure for rejection makes me terrified. Thoughts? You want my advice? Don't. Your acquaintance is an ass, whatever. Just keep up your shit and let him rot.
My wife told me she's no longer in love with me and is considering divorce, what should I do?	Love is a choice. She hasn't fallen out of love; she has decided that she no longer wants to show love to you. That's pretty crappy of her. I don't subscribe to the idea that we fall in and out of love. Love is an action, not a passive emotion. We don't need to feel love for someone before we show love for someone. Right now she has a choice of whether or not to love you and she's choosing not to. It sucks. Then she's hiding behind the excuse of "not feeling like it". There's a chance there is something deeper going on. I'd encourage you to take what you can out of marriage counselling and use it moving forward in other relationships. You can't make her stay. This is unfortunate and I'm sad to here this. :(	Went through something pretty similar although without children. One day out of nowhere Wife tells me she doesn't love me anymore and hadn't for months. She checked out emotionally and when she only agreed to reluctantly work on it, it only lasted a week. She only did it in the first place to feel less guilty about leaving. Kind of like "Well, I tried!" I feel for you, man. This sucks. It will get worse before it gets better. Don't try to rationalize it as none of it will make sense. She's been thinking about this for months and has already justified her actions and is probably just humoring you. Start planning for a divorce right now and focus on your children. Again, I'm really sorry. Best of luck to you.
Alright guys what was a giant red flag you encountered early on, but still went with it? How'd that go?	Fuck her a few times with a rubber on and then bail. And make sure they are your rubbers and not hers. Crazy bitches do crazy things but they fuck like monsters.	"Man, her whole family is fucking insanely bat-shit crazy. Trashy, narcissistic, unreasonable, undisciplined, entitled. I can't understand how she came from those people and yet is nothing like them!" Yeah, whoops.
What is a trait you find attractive , but comes hand in hand with something you hate ?	- I like intelligence, but I hate issues; both tend to go hand in hand in my experience. - I like good looks, but I hate it when a woman thinks she's the shit and behaves accordingly; again, both tend to go hand in hand.	Long hair == Loose hair everywhere. Hair all over the house. Hair in your food. Hair in your buttcrack when you're 500 miles apart and haven't seen each other for several days. *EDIT* To the people that keep saying "you need to shower better" in regards to the buttcrack hairs, hygiene or lack thereof is not where they come from. They cling to your clothes as a result of the washer or dryer. Lint rollers are no match for it.
Why aren't adult stores more men-friendly?	Female sexuality is seen as a right, natural, and beautiful. Male sexuality is seen as perverted and vile. Thus the sex toy market that uses open shops (as opposed to internet) will be geared towards women, and it will be women working there.	If you're going to judge someone for being a pervert while you work at an adult store then you need to get your head checked.
DAE ever date a woman just because, "Well, she's interested, it's not like anybody else is, I'm lonely and maybe she's cool"?	I do this too but I have come to realize the only girls I "genuinely" fall in "love" with are the super hot ones. I've learned to not be so entitled and my girlfriend of 2 years is not a supermodel, but loyal. The really beautiful model looking girls have the choice of the most powerful men in the world. It's a supply and demand reality. Average men don't get above average women.	If a girl is interested in me I will always be interested back because 100% of the time if I'm interested in a girl *first* it's never reciprocal. Girls liking me first = 100% success rate Me liking girls first = 0% success rate.
Is it irrational to not let my man do any sexual stuff with me when family are in the house?	Yeah, it is pretty irrational. Your parents have sex when you are in the house. Unless they have made a rule saying you can't have sex in their house then I don't see what the problem is. At a party I was hosting last year I slunk off upstairs with a girl and about halfway through the act my father opened the door to kick whomever was in my room out, noticed it was me, chuckled and shut the door again.	You are perfectly ok with setting boundaries like this. You just need to be straightforward with him. Literally tell him "I'm not comfortable doing this with other people in the house." He may be frustrated because you have done it before. So you might need to find some other outlet for sex besides "Let's just hang out platonically unless our family isn't home." I would find it frustrating having an up-in-the-air sex life like that. I'm not sure what that solution is or what your options are in that regard.
Is it okay for my 21 year old brother to be in a relationship a 15 year old girl? Should I do anything about it?	He's in a relationship with a minor. There's a word for people who do that. It's not a pretty one.	15 puts him at risk of ending up on the sex offender registry. Keep away from the jailbait, they have nothing to offer but inexperience and drama anyway.
There seems to be a big societal push for more women in STEM fields. Why isn't there a similar push for men in education &amp; health fields?	Men are already in health fields. The reason for men being shut out of female-heavy jobs is that the women don't want men competing for their jobs. They want their jobs, and they want our jobs.	Because there's this myth, still, that women are under-represented in education. Even though women hold more college AND graduate degrees, graduate AND are enrolled in college at higher rates, have entire departments dedicated to studying their (our?) gender, and a myriad of other things, higher education has a hard-on for women (bonus points for being a 'woman of color,' in my hispanic-lady-experience). If a woman goes into STEM, she faced adversity to do so, so the mindset goes. If a man does the same in an education/ administrative one, there is no such belief, IME. Women receive more gender-based scholarships and have more out-of-classroom support, yet are *still* thought to be systemically oppressed and face all kinds of 'barriers' in education.
What's the most impressive dad-reflex moment you've witnessed?	Once my kids were wrestling outside the house. One of them was slamming the other up against it. Quick as I could, I ran out there to put an end to it, and gave them a scolding. Luckily, the siding was OK.	I was at a hockey game with my dad, and a puck escaped the rink. I didn't see it coming for me. But my dad did. Snapped his hand out, and caught the puck as soon as it was near my face. Then he casually handed the puck to me.
When walking alone behind a woman (especially at night) do any of you adjust your speed so that she doesn't think you are a rapist?	I keep my speed and don't give a shit about her. If she is not happy she can go to tumblr post about how much oppressed she is.	I'll talk to myself loudly so she knows that I'm conversational and not intent on causing her any duress. Then, occasionally, I'll unleash a spine-chilling shriek into the night to ward of any ne'er-do-wells that might be nearby. If the talking to myself and screaming doesn't make her feel safe, I'll begin laughing maniacally so she knows I'm a man of good humor and not a raving lunatic.
What is the stupidest turn off ?	I wouldn't date anyone who isn't passionate about music. And when I say passionate, I mean literally obsessed with music and knows all the ins and outs of their favourite genres. I don't mean to sound snobbish or anything but I can't bring myself to be interested in people who "just listen to whatever".	noncommital answers to my questions. We're on a first date and I'm trying to get to know you and you're answering my questions with "I dunno" or some equivalent. I went on a date with a woman, she was a journalism professor who had previously worked as a journalist and been in many countries and cities but every questions about her travels was met with answers that would make you think she grew up in Mayberry and had never left there.
Opening the door to girlfriend in lingerie - yay or nay?	A healthy man will always take sex over rest. He might want a shower first though after traveling. Answer the door in the towel and offer to take a shower with him or some shit. That sounds good to me.	It's a great idea, just make sure he is coming home alone (i.e. his aunt isn't coming by for a surprise visit)
New ad campaign in NYC #manspreading? Not sexist?	If only there was some way of asking someone to make space for you, eg.: "Do you mind if I sit there?" This problem seems to have been created purely because people do not wish to make small-talk on trains and buses. Even a single sentence is too much. I mean, I get it, I'm incredibly lazy too, I just don't put up signs about it.	This is hysterical. If a guy is sitting with his legs spread and he's taking up too much room for you to sit down, all you have to do is say, "Excuse me, do you mind if I sit here?" and, like magic, he will move his legs. End of story. Crisis solved.
Is it weird to text a girl that didn't give you her number?	I would strongly discourage you from texting her. Find another way to contact her a little more naturally. Even sending her a message on Facebook, or having a mutual friend (not the one you mentioned) pass a message that you were looking to get in touch. I couldn't imagine and out of the blue text message going too well.	I don't see anything wrong with "Hi, I'm whty, roommate's friend. He gave me your number." and reevaluating based on her response. Just don't make it a sexual initial text.
Middle-aged men - do you still find your middle-aged spouse (or women your own age in general) attractive?	> the outlook is bleak for women. You think it is better for men? How many older men you actually see with much younger women?	Here I am at 70 going on 71. In all that time since I was 14 or so, I never had that idea that the woman (girl) has to look like - fill in the current blank from the beauty ads or the barbi doll collection. So my current S.O. is a couple years older than me. Her skin feels just like skin, her breasts feel like breasts, and all the other parts feel the same and respond the same. The visuals and whatever about the wrinkles and sags - are the same for me as for her. I am not what I used to be, but hey - I am still alive, and still sensual. So is she.
What are some early indications that a girl might be **too** high maintenance for your taste?	Has a nice car. She wears overpriced, oversized Gucci sunglasses that probably cost around $200-$500. Wearing the latest designer clothes and shoes. Unapproachable, negative body language. Has a "It's all about me and no one else" attitude.	I love When Harry Met Sally. Relevant dialog: Harry Burns: There are two kinds of women: high maintenance and low maintenance. Sally Albright: Which one am I? Harry Burns: You're the worst kind; you're high maintenance but you think you're low maintenance. Sally Albright: I don't see that. Harry Burns: You don't see that? Waiter, I'll begin with a house salad, but I don't want the regular dressing. I'll have the balsamic vinegar and oil, but on the side. And then the salmon with the mustard sauce, but I want the mustard sauce on the side. "On the side" is a very big thing for you. Sally Albright: Well, I just want it the way I want it. Harry Burns: I know; high maintenance.
How do you get yourself out of bed in the mornings?	Here's a little tough love kiddo. Grow the fuck up. If 4 alarms can't wake you up, the problem is not with the alarms.	Keep a water bottle next to your bed. After the first alarm roll over and take 10 sips of water (or 5 large gulps). You are now awake enough to get in the shower. Towel off and realize that your second and third alarms have been ringing while you were showering. Your roommates probably hate you. Sprint into the bedroom and shut them off. You are now awake enough to eat breakfast. Eat breakfast. You are now too awake to go back to bed. Fuck it, might as well get on with the day.
Dealing with codependency?	In short, it sounds like you others to care for your emotional wellbeing without giving a damn about theirs. And, no, unless you live in a shack in the central Nevada desert, or a small cabin on the Alaskan frontier or are otherwise cut off from human contact, you can't really say that you just rely on yourself and yourself alone.	from my perspective as an independent dealing with the same thing: it's incompatibility. it definitely is in my case, at least. but I would postulate it is for you also. How to deal: tell them that it isn't working out the way you want it to and move on. if they push the issue, bring up needing more space and independent time and that while normally, communicating is an endearing trait, the way that they are doing is turning you off heavily.
Is Bromance with Benefits a thing?	Why do you have to associate closeness with 'how dicks looked'? I am closer than close than close with 2 good/great friends, and everything's up for grabs, except real sexual things. As in, real life sex-acts and anatomy between us. Rest everything about sex-acts and anatomy is okay, but ours and our families' sex-lives we generally don't talk about. And, we've not and don't want to see each other naked/etc. either: no. I hope noone of us shows each others our dicks; let's just say that.	"benefits" in this context refers to sexual acts, and if both of the guys are straight then that's not gonna happen
Growing up my parents raised me to believe that just because a guy will have sex with me, doesn't mean he likes or respects me. Do you think that's outdated, or still a good thing for women to bear in mind when dating?	Yes, it's pretty outdated. But more than that: What I don't like about statements made like this is that it places a large emphasis on the guy's view of a woman, instead of her view of herself. Tell her that if she has sex with a guy and that's all he wants, she might feel used afterward. Let her know what the result is for her, not for him.	> Growing up my parents raised me to believe that just because a guy will have sex with me, doesn't mean he likes or respects me. This is sometimes true. I've met a bunch of men who will sleep with women and not respect them in the least. As in, banging them bitches yo! Hoes. However, I've also known a bunch of men who will only sleep with women whom they both like and respect. This is one of those things where you have to go on a case-by-case basis, but what you're concerned with does definitely happen.
Do you guys think the fadeaway/ghosting is a valid way to end a casual relationship?	Might I point out that the truth in breaking up usually doesn't go over very well with women. Among those truths are: * You got too fat (not to fuck, but to be in a long relationship with) * You're too boring (idem) * I don't respect you enough (idem) * I've outgrown you, and can do better than you now * You're only feminist when it's in your favor Imagine, if you will, that every guy who just faded away cared enough about you not to tell you these things in your face. Similar argument holds if sexes are reversed, obviously.	Of course not. It's a cowardly way to end things. Have the balls to end it face to face like an adult. Give your reasons. Say thanks and goodbye. UNLESS they treated you bad. Then you don't owe 'em anything. Source: The 'fade away' thing was done to me. It sucks.
NSFW: Favorite adult video stars?	Porn stars are pretty unsexy to me by default. Just the fact that it's so fake seeming does nothing for me!	Jynx Maze because of her ass, skin color and face, Lexi Belle because she is cute and can orgasm easily and Roxy Raye because she is really creative and does a lot of anal. Some other favorites would be Cytheria, Heather Harmon (aka Heather Brooke), Remy Lacroix, Bonnie Rotten, Asa Akira, Christy Mack, Sophie Dee and Naomi Russell.
What does your girlfriend do to initiate sex?	She began to fellate me at 5am and said she wanted some. I couldn't at the time cuz I was way too tired so she went out on the patio for a dip in the tub instead.	Kiss on him, grab his cock, and tell him how badly you want it inside you. Not that hard tbh
Do people ever believe you're a certain type of person when you really aren't?	I come off as an annoying prick with a low tolerance for stupidity. In reality, I'm a bit of an annoying prick with a low tolerance for stupidity... But I love helping people. Come to me with a problem, I'll do my damndest to help you with a smile on my face.	People think I am incredibly intelligent. I am not. I was smart in school and I know a lot of trivia, so I gained a reputation of "Lockjaw knows everything" and that anyone could ask me anything and get a good answer. If they ever saw me at university, they would see that I am not at all above average. A lot of people also excuse any mistake I make by attributing it to the "crazy" part of the "crazy genius" picture they have of me. It's not easy getting rid of an image like that, and I have to admit that I have played into it at times where it was beneficient to me.
I need some happy thoughts - what good stuff has happened to you recently?	I'm a woman but I really REALLY have to answer this! I've been working as a temp since Nov 2012 and in the same position with the same company since Aug 2013. I just got word from my boss's boss's boss that I am being hired as a perm employee and the transition should complete by next week. Not only is that going great for me, but they also offered me $6k more than what I currently make!!!!! This means that I can take on more student loans and I can pay off my taxes because I couldn't do that the last 2 years and have worked with the IRS. My life is finally looking a lot better (not that it wasn't good, just better!)	I've been consistently working out. I've stopped drinking. I've stopped caring about finding a girlfriend. I'm just working on me, and I love it :D
What advice do you have for girls that are a bit jealous of better looking girls?	1) Get fitter. Are all your friends at 18% bodyfat? Because otherwise, there's work they could be doing. 2) Dress better. Get better hair and makeup. These things matter a lot. 3) Don't make your self-worth all about how you look. Develop a personality and become successful in your career. These things matter a lot more for happiness in the long run, and even if you're the hottest woman in the world at 22, by 32 you will not be anymore. That's what I'd tell them, anyway. Maybe that's why nobody complains to me about this kind of shit anymore.	You're extremely susceptible to some douchebag just saying what you want to hear (that you're really much prettier than her) to get into your panties.
Straight men of AM: what's the one thing about female sexuality/anatomy you learned from a SO that surprised you?	Nothing. Actually, with all the partners I've had, I've usually known more about female sexuality/anatomy than them, and have taught them stuff about their own bodies than they knew...	Pretty much everything to do with periods. I thought you just stuck the tampon in, amd you were all done. I also thought some sort of seal broke at the end of the week and it all just came out. Lots of stuff
"Why are you so nice to me?" Why are so many people dating mean people?	I'm a fat woman, middle aged. Never been in a relationship, but I have been on a few dates. Every date I've gone on, the guy has acted appallingly in some way -- ignored me, insulted and argued with me, or tried to grope me. I can't speak for men, but, as a woman, unless you're attractive enough to have guys feel they need to woo you and compete for you, yes, being with someone awful is often the price of having a social life.	Because they've never known any better. > (like tidying when you're a guest, bringing over food, cooking meals, picking up small gifts etc). I've only had one girlfriend that did things like this. The first time I came home and she had cleaned my apartment my first thought was that she was about to break up with me, and the clean place was to soften the blow.
(XPost from AskWomen) Do unnattractive men feel invisible/ignored?	This question goes to show how women have no fucking clue how easy life is for them sometimes. Equality is a long way away, if you ask me.	I'm not unattractive, but I hardly get any attention, despite having been told by others that I am attractive. This doesn't bother me, I prefer solitude, but does seem to fit in the idea that even attractive men are ignored unless they are *very* attractive.
What's the deal with standards?	Standards are what you prefer in a partner. There's nothing at all wrong with having any type of standard. I want a woman who's actually fit and strong, not just a cardio bunny; these women are exceedingly rare, but that's the standard they'll have to stand up to.	It's a polite and roundabout way of saying that people should both be more aware of what they have to offer themselves and have realistic expectations from others. All while tiptoeing around the concepts of 'leagues' or 'scales from 1 to 10'.
What is the best way to compliment women you don't know?	I used to do that. But then feminism happened, and I understood that I was actually raping them. So I stopped.	I'm not a woman, but I've found that complimenting specific things go farther than "you look nice." Example: "Your eye shadow looks great. Matches your outfit well." I think that this stuff works because applying this stuff is HARD. (I just recently started french braiding my girlfriend's hair. She burned her fingers and couldn't do ponytails while they were healing, so I took over. French braids look really, really nice, but BOY OH MOTHERFUCKING BOY are they hard to get right the first *n* times around. Damn straight I'll compliment anyone woman or dude that nails their braid, especially if they did it themselves.) This is how women do it with other women; friendships are formed over this kind of stuff
Have you ever given oral/fingered your SO without expecting sex in return?	Stupid question. Answer is yes of course. In what kind of horrible relationship would people be unwilling to give pleasure without something in return?	Sure have. Usually I enjoy more back-and-forth, but from time to time I'll just get her off and then we can cuddle.
Do you think women care about how fast we respond to text messages?	"Women" have no consensus opinion on this issue. Lots of people care and pay attention to that stuff, lots of others don't. My policy has always been that if somebody judges me for responding too quickly, they're a shitty person anyway.	I think women think about things I've never thought about before and I think you should ask them how they think because I don't think I know how they think but they know how they think. I think.
Guys who have been proposed to: How did you react? Did you know it was gonna happen?	I laughed at him and said if he felt like he could propose to me he didn't know me well enough. Edit: If you are confused I am a dude.	I was thinking about proposing to my girlfriend at the end of our month-long trip to Thailand. One night in the middle of the vacation while we are boning, she looks me in the eye and says "Will you marry me?" I go "Did you just ask me that?" She says "Please?" with puppy dog eyes. I say yes and we finish boning. It was such a surprise, but a very welcome one. It made me so damn happy and honestly took an insane amount of pressure off me. We also like telling people that she proposed.
Has anyone found their tolerance for alcohol has gone down the older they get?	I hate to break it to you, but you've got a problem if you're drinking that much, that often. There's never a reason to drink a full fifth in a single night. And this comes from a regular drinker. I have two or three shots worth of bourbon or rum pretty much every night. To answer your question: I haven't noticed much difference. On the very rare occasion that I have more than normal to drink I don't notice much difference. If anything, my regular drink levels effect me less than when I was younger. I'm serious. Drinking that much is killing you. That's what the hangovers are telling you. Think about this serious and maybe have a talk with someone.	I have, but I'll fight tooth and nail to be in denial about it. At one point, I used to be the last man standing in most drinking events. Now, I'll be lucky to manage about 6 strong beers on a good day and with a good meal in my tummy to sponge it up without going wibbly wobbly. It's fucking cruel how this works - when I'm young and have a higher alcohol tolerance, I need to blow up more cash (cash I don't really have a lot of) to get comfortably numb. But now, when I actually do earn and have enough cash to blow on stuff like this on the odd occasion, it ends up being a damp squib. Life is a cruel mistress. :<
Have you ever been "one of the girls?" How was it?	Of course. Some of my best friends are girls, and it's not unusual for me to be the only guy hanging out with a pile of girls on any given day. I find that the best place to get advice about girls is from girls, and I'm sure they're finding that the best place to get guy advice is from guys.	Yeah, pretty frequently. It gets awkward when they start talking about sex, though, because inevitably they look to me for a man's perspective, and I really don't have one to offer.
How do you feel about the Mens Right Activist Movement?	There are a few things that men are legitimately discriminated against. But if you ranked discrimination, men are very much at the bottom of the list. As a white guy, I never think about my race or my gender. Which is totally a white guy thing. So mostly I feel that the MRA movement is a bit ridiculous.	Two "men's rights" issues that come to mind: one is conditions in male prisons. I knew a jailhouse nurse once. Horrendous stories. Also, I see prison rape (for men) jokes are still fair game on late night TV. Probably a sign that the lives of men in prison might not be taken seriously. Second is the ease with which we send men to war. We talk a good game about giving a fuck, but I think economics is as much a reason that the last war dwindled down. (And then there's the fact that killing men on the other side is (sometimes) regarded as a good thing, but that's war, etc. It's complicated.) So, I think there are legitimate issues. I have no idea to what extent the MRAM concerns themselves with that stuff.
Men of AskMen who grew up before the Internet became huge: How did YOU get your porn fix?	I came of age right before the Internet was literally everywhere. Had a friend with an older brother who had porno mags and tapes, and we would raid his stash. Also, in the beginning, it was actually kind of tough to find good, free porn (don't get me wrong, you could see tons of boobs everywhere but actually getting a good clip or galleries or VIDEOS was somewhat difficult). There were sites that compiled passwords for big paysites. Nothing like pornhub.	I grew up during the rise of the internet, I've seen both sides of the porn-revolution haha. When I was younger, all I could access was a Victoria's Secret magazine, or more commonly, the underwear section of the Sears Catalog.
When you go to hang up the phone after talking to your dad, do you exchange an "I love you"?	Never in my life. Since I was 12 or so, I don't even greet my parents. No reason to do it.	We didn't for the longest time. But then, despite him being in very good health, I started saying it when he was around 62-63; because, well, you never know which conversation is going to be the last. We continued that for several years and then one day last June, at 69 and still apparently very healthy, he dropped dead from a pulmonary embollism. I don't really remember the last conversation with my Dad, but I can guarantee you that our last words were "bye. love you. love you too." Yeah... not embarrassed by that in the least.
Men who love their jobs, what do you do?	I don't love my job, and many people don't; I don't think you need to "love" your job in order to be happy, though it's definitely ideal. You sure won't get any better sense of what you want to do by asking strangers on the internet. Are you thinking about a career change? If so, find a field that interests you and try to run with it. Either way, if your current situation isn't working out, take the necessary steps. Or move to another city, whatever. Sorry I might be a bit drunk but you get my point.	I take care of people with disabilities. Love it. The people i watch over really enjoy having me around since we are all around the same age (21). Most aren't verbal but we still have conversations. Even one of the guys who is very aggressive toeards staff hasnt tried to hit me yet. I dont even say i work. I just hang out with friends and get paid for it.
My girlfriend is currently the centre of my life (by choice), is this bad?	Yes, it is. Never make your woman your mission. You will lose both your mission and your woman this way. However, it sounds like you have outgrown your old friends (because they are stuck in high school party mode, and you aren't). Make your studies your mission, and make some new friends, ones that you do not share with her. This will keep you and your relationship healthy.	I wouldn't call what you're describing as making your gf the center of your life. It just sounds to me like you're growing out of the partying lifestyle while at the same time focusing more on your relationship. The two are only loosely connected, although who's to say that if you were single you wouldn't still enjoy all the partying? Tbh it's a natural progression for most guys, I think. All the drinking and carrying on is fun when you're late teens/early 20s but as you get older it just doesn't hold the same appeal. Then you get all responsible and shit.
Men who are engaged or married, what was the moment that made you realize: I want to make this woman my wife?	play video game with me even though she isn't very good, takes and interest in my hobbies that she's isn't to interested in and I do the same for her. Edit plus she is pretty tight ;)	When I was dying, before I knew I was going to recover, my now wife worked 3 jobs, but still managed to spend 5-6 hours a day with me, even if it meant she was passed out on the uncomfortable hospital chairs to be near me. She spent so much time there that the nurses grabbed a convertible chair/bed for her so she could at least have some kind of sleep.
Whats the next romantic or sexual taboo that Western society will give up?	Hopefully, with more people than ever before leaving organised religion, we can be a lot more open and realistic about sex (the good parts and the bad), and lose the artificial guilt and trappings based on primitive voodoo shtick. Hopefully this also means the elimination at some point of abortion clinic protests and bombings, and taxpayer funded abstinence-only sex education programs. It'll likely never happen, but it's a nice thought.	I'm thinking nudity on TV. We already have incredibly popular TV shows that have nudity, and sex as well, that have not ended the human race with their exposed nipples. Game of Thrones comes to mind
Have you ever turned down sex from a person who was clearly throwing themselves at you? What happened?	Yes, more than once. I remember a slightly boozy girl I met at a movie theater lobby, friend of friends, and this woman at a gym who asked me to go upstairs w/ her etc. I dislike and suspect women who make themselves suddenly sexually available and don't find it an arousing scenario.	When I was in high school, this girl invited me to her house. She was alone, threw herself on her bed and said to take her now. I said no... She said gimmie three reasons why, if you can't, you have to. I said, "I don't have anything to protect us." She said it wasn't a good reason. I walked out. Next school year, she was pregnant. I was glad I walked away...
Guys in their preteens or teens, what have you been taught about "how a man should be"? What's it like being a young man in 2015?	Talking about gendered norms, we are getting to the stage where it is not necessarily considered a good thing about a guy for him to be a feminist. Many girls are anti-feminist themselves. Which is, frankly, hilarious. Edit: Yep, downvote because it has the word 'feminist' in it. Well done.	18 year old from Holland here >Are there emotions that are "unmanly" to feel, or display? Jealousy I'd say >How are you expected to treat women? Respectfull, not different from men tbh >Are there any online norms that are gendered? What do you mean? >Do you feel like "becoming a man" is an important aspect of your life right now? Not at all >What are the issues young men are facing currently? Shyness I'd say, for women it can be seen as cute, not for men
What are the sexiest skills a woman can have? Like if a sexy musician dude is a panty-dropper for women, what is the equivalent turn-on for men?	Little to no makeup. When out together, I never see a smartphone. Never mentions social media. Rides mountain bikes. Loves to cook like I do. Doesn't care for high fashion.	I find female musicians incredibly sexy. I was in a band and there was this small, shy, girl who had a fairly average appearance. She had a very low confidence attitude about herself. Hunched shoulders. Quiet speech. The moment she picked up that violin she transformed. The energy and posture needed to play that instrument instantly conveyed a confidence I didn't know she was even capable of. Definitely made her sexy. I also tend to like artists. If she can paint or draw that's a big turn on for me.
What are some signs that your relationship with somebody is progressing from casual to more serious?	pooping with the door open. I'm 100% serious, we'll continue conversations from the bed room to the bathroom and maintain eye contact through out the whole thing	I think what I noticed, with my last relationship, was that she could literally show up to my apartment unannounced and I'd be happy to see her. We were so comfortable that things just 'worked' like that. In a weird way, when things get serious they feel more casual. When things are casual they feel more serious, if that makes sense.
Men, do you want to fall into traditonal gender roles?	Something you may not have noticed yet is that feminists tend to pick and choose which gender roles should be challenged. Woman expected to be in the kitchen? Unacceptable! Women receive lighter punishments than men for the same crime? Preferred! Women not 50% of Engineering degrees? Sexism! Men have 10% chance of getting custody of their kids? They can't take care of kids anyway!	Nah. Sometimes I fall into traditional roles, sometimes I don't. I never think "Is this a manly thing to do?" I think "Is this something I want to do?" and "Is this the right thing to do?"
Who's a male sex symbol whose sexiness is a complete mystery?	James Deen (porn star). >"Porn is so wrong and degrading to women!" >"James Deen is like sooooo hot, and his adult films are for some reason acceptable whereas all other porn is terrible trash."	Ed Sheeran. That dude gets to hang out with Victoria's Secret models. I don't get it. Really though it's probably just because he can sing so well.
You can gain one advantage the female gender has but have to give something equivalent in return. What do you do?	Never at fault for anything. I could literally get away with murder. I would trade being treated like an adult for that.	This feels like one of those Twilight Zone episodes about a genie with a twisted sense of irony. "Your wish to have attractive people approach you more often has been granted...but you can never get them to leave you alone! Muahahaha!"
What advice would you give your daughter for avoiding players, liars, cheaters?	Why couldn't she be notching her own belt? I have no problems with my female relatives enjoying sex and pursuing it. That's a healthy attitude.	If he's a jerk to other people, but nice to you it's not because you are special and can change him. It's because he's a jerk who wants in your pants. He'll go back to being a jerk after he gets that.
Fellow European men, when reading /r/AskMen, what are the biggest differences you perceive between European and American men?	To be fair, the US is just as vast and varied a culture as we have in Europe. Seems strange to pit one against the other. But in saying that I don't think there's as heavy a culture of "status" here as there seems to be in a lot of instances described on this forum and others I've read. Salaries and whathaveyou, especially in regards to dating, seems almost alien to me.	It's much harder for us to drive to Canada. Also, height seems to be a much bigger deal for guys in the US.
Heya Gentlemen, what is the "manliest" movie to come out in the last 25 years?	The Grey. Liam Neeson in a hauntingly well acted role trying to get a few men through the wilderness alive.	First one that comes to mind is Gran Torino. Young punk's transition to adulthood guided by the dirty old man next door who is struggling to accept 21st century American life. But I'm sure there are other better examples.
What's the best story about yourself you had to be told the next day?	Anytime I got passed first base in college it something I had to be told about later. While in college I could be blacked out and still be coherent enough to seem like was just buzzed. Other times I would remain conscious and get falling down drunk.	Woke up on my couch with a dead phone. I got into my bed so hungover and plugged in my phone. The mass amount of texts that started coming in from all different people was crazy because they were all sent while the phone was dead. **I had made out with a professor two nights before graduation**
Is there a girl in your life who you're not dating, but you know that you could have sex with?	Several that I could call up and be naked with by tonight if I so desired. None as badass as my gf though.	I have a gf, that being said, there are three or four girls I know have a thing for me and a basically waiting out my relationship (they'll have a long wait). If I called any of them I'm pretty sure I could have them tonight. However, were I to get break up with my gf, I'm convinced that they would not be as interested.
[Feedback!] People who've asked AskMen for advice: How did we do? How did it go?	Ugh, it was awful. I wanted advice on how to bring up the subject of a late period with someone I wasn't serious with, and all the comments were "teeheehee, your problem now cunt" edit: You'll see some people questioning me and downvoting in the children of this comment. That's what I mean by "the sentiment".	I was finally coaxed into trying boxer briefs. Solved all my issues with running and other workouts. Thanks guys! Edti: Oh, and also I got a tip about sterilizing my razor with alcohol before I shave. It has reduced my bumps noticeably.
Men would my situation be a turn-off for you?	If she's attractive and has a personality I find charming, sure, I'd probably be interested. I'm ok with a lack of experience, so that's not really an issue, but I don't find painfully shy people particularly charming. And having dated someone with depression, I'm not sure if I'd be very eager to get back into that situation.	You're gonna want to find a super sensitive, somewhat inexperienced guy who is willing to work with you. Put up a dating site profile, be somewhat upfront by saying something like, "I don't have much experience dating, but I want a relationship if you're willing to work with me." Everyone comes with baggage. It's not like you're ForeverAlone.
Do you think you'll ever get to be the Best Man at a wedding?	I was asked to be someone's best man. Later I found out I was just one of the groomsmen. Was still pretty cool. They only lasted a year anyways.	After my best mate told me he was thinking of proposing to his gf I was happy for him. But after a day I thought "oh crap. I'm his best mate which means I'm gonna be his bestman! I don't know what to do if it happens..." haha
I [22F] am Muslim and have become friends with [26M] Catholic man at work. In spite of everything, I want more, what can I do to get closure after letting him know?	So, let me get this straight... God/Allah creates people. Creates love. Let's love happen between two people, then would say "no" because you two like the same book from different authors? I think he'll understand.	Can you explain a little more about how conservative/liberal you are in your belief structure? There's so many nuances here. I have some fairly liberal Muslim friends, and this wouldn't be an issue at all, but I know if you're a bit more conservative it would be. Are you specifically not allowed to date outside your religion?
What is with this "niceness coins, sex vending machine" thing?	It has become a trope because it is so common. If you saw the number of posts on askwomen where a guy is upset that a woman didn't want to date him even though he was *soooo* nice to her and it must mean that girls only fall for alpha assholes who treat them badly... It would make you vomit.	Also consider the corollary theory, as also described (possibly coined) here on Reddit. Many women do start relationships with guys they know are assholes or cheaters because they *know* their love will change them. But then it doesn't work out, of course, and they complain that all men are assholes, and this guy should have changed after all the work they did... "But Men aren't vending machines you can put sex coins into and kindness comes out."
Those of you who work while going to school full time, how do you do it?	Suck it up and work smart. You likely won't have a single hour of free time in your life. It's perfectly normal. Just keep working. Cut everything out of your life that isn't school or work, and maybe 5 hours a week of lifting to keep your sanity. When I graduated and got a job in my field where I was working only 40 hours a week and making plenty of money I didn't know what to do with all my free time. School will only be a few years of your life but working while in school teaches you an incredible work ethic.	I worked 20 hours a week while taking 18-20 credits in Computer Engineering. It's ALL about scheduling and time management. Schedule your classes back to back to back. Start with morning classes. Try to have your classes done by noon or 1 in the afternoon. Then you can work until 5 or 6, and do homework / labs from 7 until 11 or so. Make your lunches & dinner and bring them with you. I actually even kept my weekends pretty free this way.
Men who miss at public urinals, what do your bathrooms at home look like?	Missing at home is simple. You just wipe it up. Missing in public do you really expect me to clean that shit? naw.	It's not as simple as you make it seem. Urine doesn't always flow straight out from my johnson in one orderly stream. It's like playing Russian roulette with one of those hose nozzles with 7 different spray settings.
"we do not pick up on hints, ever. We are awful at it." How true is that?	Pretty accurate. I've had a gorgeous girl sitting in my lap kiss me gently on the lips, and I was sure she wasn't interested. Be blunt.	Just realize that all the subtle hints that women drop, guys have seen before from women who aren't actually interested. Sometimes it's just because she's friendly or likes the attention. You have leave very obvious hints for it not be big a big risk.
Have you noticed any differences dating girls who self-identify as feminists, vs girls who don't?	Yes. They vote liberal, you cannot make certain jokes to your friends, and they are not great at understanding the other side of the argument.	I'm sure I've dated some, but it's never really come up. I suppose that means it's mostly a non-issue. Only exception was I did briefly see someone that thought boys falling behind in schools was some sort of comeuppance. I ended up bailing for other reasons, but that definitely wasn't a turn on.
Men with significant others: what's the weirdest/craziest/most blatant way somebody has tried to get with or flirt with your SO?	Most blatant from the other side: I met a hottie, clearly with her boyfriend. We were talking for a bit. I'm getting flirty, he's about 6ft away. She had this awesome fur collar on, and I asked if I could touch it. She said yes, and then I petted it and said "Oooooo that's soft." She just looked at me like "wow." Didn't speak to me after that, but heh what a thrill, I do what I want. Probably wouldn't have taken it further, I just like to play :)	One of my SO's "friends" has the hots for her. It is actually really funny, I've been introduced to him once and he didn't even make eye contact. There was one great story about it, once at a bar whenever I'd leave he'd come over to talk to my SO and when I'd return he'd vanish. I told my SO about the phenomena and she didn't believe me. So I would walk away and come back, I did it like six times and everytime he'd run away as soon as I walked back. Hahaha, once it was even in the middle of his sentence. My only thought is that the dude thought I would fight him over my SO if I saw him talking to her, which I wouldn't, but it would explain the behavior.
What is the one type of girl you will never, ever date?	Went through the whole thread and no one said "single moms." Nothing says "I'm the shitty kind of risk taker and horrible at making decisions" like a fucking kid. Maybe someone else will like you for your personality and not mind raising a kid that isn't theirs, but not this guy.	I once dated a girl who was an otherkin. She wouldn't kiss me because that isn't what owls do, and she would always try to turn her head all the way around because she said she was too used to looking that way in her past life. I'm never going to date an otherkin ever again. It's too weird and IMHO, completely made up to get attention.
Men, what's a big goal in your life right now?	Everyone is being a lot more specific than this, but I would really like to be the best version of myself that I can be. All along I have known what I need to do to be the best I can be, but I am only just now starting this. Quitting smoking 3 months ago, reading and listening to podcasts, playing more music, succeeding in school... But generally succeeding.	Accumulate enough cash in exchange for my labor so that I no longer need to expend my labor to accumulate cash.
What are your thoughts on hunting?	Not a fan of it and I won't participate in it. I'm well aware I can kill something. I don't want to. I don't see personal value in killing something. I can understand the need if food isn't readily available or there's an issue of over-population, but short of necessity, I see nothing to be gained from the act. To be blunt, I view people who kill for fun and don't eat the animal or do so because it needs to be done, a sad sad sort.	Alabamian here. Not something I'm into myself, I'd much rather hunt paper targets at the range for an hour or two with one of those scary "assault rifles". I respect the people that do hunt though, successful hunters have to be extremely patient and their marksmanship must be excellent in order to close out their tags in a season; I admire the skill all that entails. But it's not something I could see myself going out of my way to do, too many Disney movies as a kid I guess.
Ever had that extreme cockblocker?	To the cute chick: "Hey, I think you're cute. How about we talk sometime without your self-appointed chaperone?" And to the bitch, if needed: "Look, I know it bugs the shit out of you that men are interested in your friend and never want you, but turning the bitch dial up to eleven is not going to fix your problem. Go on a diet, learn how to do your hair and make up, or if that doesn't work, just go hang out in a bar and pick up drunk dudes."	Dont judge her by her friends behavior she cant be held responsible for that outburst. The cockblock girl was clearly jealous no one ever tries to chat her up. I say go for it.
What's your shower routine look like? Are we all doing the same thing, or is there a wide variety of strategies?	Btw for those of you that don't shave or brush your teeth in the shower, you really gotta start. It's really enjoyable.	I face the shower head. I like the feeling of the hot water on my hair and face. Plus, it keeps soap out of my eyes. I don't brush my teeth or shave in the shower.
Guys with female best friends, what's your relationship like?	I had a really good female friend with whom I hung out with frequently. > How much do you tell her? Tell her what? > Do you get graphic or detailed about sex ... Never > or romantic relationships? Never graphic, but I can get detailed. > Do you ever get physical/hook up every once in awhile? Nope	Never ever hook up, doesn't cross the mind. Share everything just about, like a buddy I tell everything too but a girl.
What's the best compliment you've ever gotten? What compliment would you most like to get?	I've gotten comments from girls about my pupils always being huge. Not really a compliment per se, but I liked the fact that they actually took their time to look at some of my body parts a little closer. So I am going to take that as compliments either way! It feels good now when I think about it too. They actually checked out a part of my body! Not every day that happends! I like to hear compliments that actually are about me personality or my body. All that "you're funny" and "you're strange" is just annyoing as fuck. I really want to hear that someone likes my ways or the way I think about something, how someone feels around me and that I perhaps have some good aspects to my quite fit body! The hunt continues!	I recently got back in touch with my best friend from highschool. Turns out she had, at times, been asked why she hung out with me and why we were - and still are friends. What she replied was "because he is the only one that has been true to himself." With me often having issues with anxiety and self doubt that has been the most reassuring and empowering thing I have heard in quite a while.
Is Religion a turnoff for you?	Yes. Anyone who's willing to ascribe the cause for something to an invisible friend is not someone I would want to make a life with.	If she prevents me from eating pig meat, or forces me to go to church every sunday morning, then we have a problem. Until her religion starts affecting me aswell, we're totally fine.
Today, I peed myself in the car while stuck in traffic. When was the last time you guys peed on yourself?	Why the fuck wouldn't you, I dunno, get out and pee over the highway railing or something? If the traffic's that bad, leaving your car stopped for 30 seconds can't be that big of a deal. I don't think I've ever peed myself, except for wetting the bed like once when I was... 5? 6? Or does peeing on your own feet while you're in the shower count? If so, probably last week.	I can hold my pee like there's no tomorrow. Maybe its a combination of stage fright and laziness, but I can go like 10 or 12 hours at a time without peeing. It starts to hurt though, so I'm not sure why I do it.
In your opinion, how attractive does a guy have to be to get approached first/hit on/asked out by a woman?	For me to go up to a guy I would have to find them decently attractive. Like, a 7 at least. The last guy I went up to I would have rated him a 7-8. He ended up being mine for the night :) Edit - Should add he was 6'1" & white. Tall & white is my favorite mix. Literally had my eye on him from the moment I saw him.	He has to be well above average *for that woman*; not all women have the same tastes and preferences and level of sobriety.
[Serious] I have a Tinder date and I don't even know how to put on a condom. Should I... practice?	1. Yes, practice. Banana first, then you. 2. Don't count on hooking up. 3. Don't even think about hooking up. Just enjoy the date. Treat her like a person first. 4. Get a little flirty to "test the waters". If things go well from there, then it will all happen on it's own. Except the condom part, you still need to put that on manually.	Yes, practicing putting a condom on now means less fumbling later. Also, more importantly, you should learn to distinguish backwards from forwards. If you accidentally start with it backwards, do not turn it around and try to use it. Grab a new condom. Otherwise you've just seeded the tip of your condom with precum.
Small Update: My 14 year old brother is really perverted and inappropriate. How can I let him know some things are not okay to say?	I'm surprised you didn't rat him out for watching porn on mom's ipad. I would have. (that, and smacked him upside the head).	Good to hear your bro has changed. You have *no idea* how much embarrassment you've just saved him. I knew some guys in high school who were like him and eventually matured, but don't talk about their high school years because they cringe so hard at how they behaved.
What are some reasonably masculine non-alcoholic drinks for someone recently on the wagon?	Lapsang souchong tea. Smells like a camp fire, tastes like a camp fire. Stare into it and ponder life, then take a sip.	Tonic with lime. Plus is no one will know you're not drinking gin and tonic. Another side bonus - it glows in the presence of a black light. Or soda water and lemon (or lime).
Those of you who roomed with your best friends, how did it go?	He got mopey and depressed, I lost pretty much all respect for him, we barely talk anymore. Can't reccomend against it highly enough	Badly. I was a freshman in college, he was a junior (sophomore?) -- so both young and stupid. Too much time together, couldn't find a balance, blah blah blah. That being said -- by my senior year I moved in with a guy I hardly knew and he and I became best friends and still are now, 18 years later. Damn. If one of us had a uterus and we'd made a baby it could vote by now...
Ending a friendzone relationship with a girl. Do I owe her an explanation?	No such thing as a "friendzone relationship", that's called a friendship. Yes, if you're ending a three year friendship you generally can't just cut off contact without explanation and expect her to accept it. If this is more of an acquaintanceship you could have done a more normal fade, but since you went straight for ignoring messages of course she has questions. IMO you should just explain that you still have feelings for her and think it would be best to try to move on.	"This relationship isn't healthy for me. I want more than friendship, and since you don't share those feelings with me, I think it's best if we cut contact. Otherwise, it will be difficult for me to move past this. I've already made up my mind, but I feel that you deserve to know why. I wish you well." Be brief, but stern. Don't let her try and convince you to change your mind, either by flirting or shaming. Remember: You don't owe her your friendship, time, and attention similarly to how she doesn't owe you sex for being nice to her.
When do you find your SO most unattractive?	when she gets angry and huffy over something that she will forget about completely within 36 hours. you know what i mean, when you ask her later what she was mad about and she can't even remember. all she can remember is that *you're a dick*. some girls just need to throw tantrums and whine in order to get their fix on attention and to test whether you can handle her shit or if you will cave to her shenanigans. you both lose the moment you take it seriously.	When she pointedly forgets something that definitely happened in the past because it suits her argument. Oh *man* that one is frustrating. Oh well, we all have our flaws.
If you were raised being taught masturbation was wrong, or just not masturbating, did you have wet dreams all the time?	When my mother caught me jerking off she grounded me. Then interrogated all my friends to find out who taught me about it. She never knocked when she came in to my bedroom. When a girl called my house I got grounded for an entire summer. She wasn't religious though, she was 15 when I was born and I think that played in to it. As far as wet dreams, I've never had one. I've been able to masturbate to orgasm since I was 5 though. I wonder if that has anything to do with it.	I've got to let one out at least every other day or it's wet dream city. And my wet dreams are always fucking strange and not sexy. Like I'll be a really horny midget and I'm chasing this girl midget through a crowded mall and she'll only let me fuck her through a picture frame she's carrying around, but the damn mall cops keep coming after us with brooms when I finally catch her. It's a mess.
[Possibly NSFW] Men, who is the creepiest guy you know? What makes him creepy?	For most guys I've heard called "Creepy" I would advise them to dress better and lose some weight, as it seems creepiness and attractiveness are inversely proportional.	I know a guy who graduated from HS last year who was 19. He would hang around underclassmen, especially those that owned a 3DS. Once he knew that you owned one he would latch onto you. Even if you didnt know him. He also would laugh at everything, not a haha type of thing. But a HEAHEAUGHA. He made any situation feel uncomfortable.
What do you all think of nipple piercings?	Nipples are so good naturally, I don't think altering that beauty is a great idea. I generally hate piercings, it's a major turnoff to me. To me, only cheap slutty girls have nipple piercings. I mean why would you get one if not to show it? If it improves your own confidence, go for it, but know that a lot of men won't see it as an advantage. Many will be indifferent because, well, boobies are boobies no matter what, right?	I'd say that opinions are going to be 50/50, so it's up to you. Personally, I don't like them. They just get in the way. My SO had hers taken out recently after 14 years of having them and I'm a lot happier without them there.
My boyfriend claims that doing the "helicopter dick" is impossible. Has anyone been successful?	I'm sorry to say this, but I think your boyfriend can't do it because his penis is too small when flaccid/semi-erect, not because no one can do it. He's just making an excuse...	I'm a woman, but I went to a clothing optional beach once and there was a dude lounging on the rocks, facing the ocean, leisurely helicoptering his dick and looking really pleased with himself.
I'm quitting my phd program after only 3 months because it's too much for me. Feels pretty shitty, have you guys ever quit something pretty major without knowing what's next?	I had to quit my computational mathematics studies 3 months *before* getting a bachelor's degree. I was good at it, in the region of 75-80% scores without any effort. Going through classes and exams was easy and fun for me, but due to my life situation I just couldn't have done the thesis. So instead of heading towards highly paid perspective field, I have only useless all-round secondary education, which makes me suitable for a cashier or so. It feels pretty bad, especially because it wasn't my fault. I had absolutely no idea what to do after. Later I figured out how to get at least into IT, by taking state/EU funded server administration courses. But it's still way below my intellectual potential.	Have you considered posting in /r/gradschool for thoughts and advice? There's posts over there about crappy advisors and students hating their program all the time. I think you'd probably get constructive advice, not just "deal with it!" responses.
Women not taking husbands' last name after marriage?	I wouldn't marry a women who wouldn't take my last name. Not that it would be a problem though because the type of women to be against taking my last name wouldn't be the type of women id want to marry.	It's 2015. A lot of women keep their own last name. A lot of women take their husband's. And a lot of women hyphenate. Unfortunately, no matter what the woman does she's going to receive criticism from self-proclaimed traditionalists, from self-proclaimed feminists, from family, from friends, from people who have no right to be invested in it. What I'm saying is: it sucks, be prepared for it. As it happens, my wife did take my name, which was my preference. However, it's not a strong preference. If she had wanted to keep her own name, I would have been disappointed, but she's an adult, she gets to decide what to call herself.
Men, do you feel like working in an all-women environment is more difficult than the other way around?	I've read this hentai. Men in female environment leads to harem, female in male environment leads to either rape, happy marriage, or some combination of the two.	"walking on eggshells" is the correct phrase. i work with mostly women in my office, and i have to be careful that i don't offend my female peers. i can say anything around the guys, though. we know that we aren't going to throw a fit and go to HR because our little feelings were hurt. you have to constantly censor yourself and be extremely careful about giving criticism when working with women because they are more than likely to take criticism or a difference of opinion as a personal attack or discrimination. that's the biggest difference between working with men and women - women take a lot of irrelevant, benign, impersonal stuff as an insult or sexism/discrimination. you don't have to do that with men. nuff said.
On dating sites, how do you feel when the girl's profile says something like "Don't email me if you are a jerk or a player"?	i message a lot of females on dating sites. 100s of hours 1000s of messages and zero replies. guess im just too ugly.	"My name is Kate and I love to have fun and I'm looking for a decent guy (if that exists) to have fun with. I'm a full figured woman and I'm proud of it, looking for a man who can handle a real woman. If you want some fake barbie go away. I don't do drama. I'm not like other girls. So if you play games look at another profile. Im livn at my mothers but thats tempererery. Don't message if you are a jerk. Don't message unless you are 5'10. Don't message me if you don't have a job and a car."
Have you ever went to a bar alone? How was the experience?	I pretty much only go to bars alone. It's so much less pressure. I can sit quietly, drink, and watch TV. Or I can mingle and meet new women without the pressure of getting turned down and getting made fun of by your friends.	I started going to a bar alone, then after a while I got to know the bartenders and other regulars, and I wasn't alone anymore.
Divorced men who initiated the divorce: what could have saved it?	texting another woman while you still live in the same house & haven't even started the divorce? i would be LIVID. you wait & see how long she lasts when he has to move away in 6 months. but my honest opinion is that it sounds like you can be pretty rough on him, so he is getting the affection he needs elsewhere.	> I don't take criticism from him well I've been close to pulling the trigger a couple times because of this but she's working on it. I cannot feel safe in a relationship with a woman who reacts poorly to me telling her she's hurting me.
Straight men of reddit, how do YOU personally respond to incoming flirtation from another man?	If you have sex with men, you can still be straight, so I sometimes just have sex with them. I'm 100% straight though.	I once visited the Gay Pride parade in Chicago with a male friend of mine. We were both there to enjoy the spectacle and party atmosphere, and we're both straight. I've never been hit on so much in my life. I was never uncomfortable, I found the people very open and friendly and very understanding and accepting. My favourite moment came in the lineup at the Mongolian BBQ. The line ups for food could get pretty long, and I remarked to my buddy as we waited that, "There must be some way to get ahead in this line." The guy behind me said, "I'm sure you'd have no trouble finding someone to give you head in this line."
Inexperienced/timid guys- Can I put your hands on my boobs when we're making out?	No. Because If you do that then some guy will assume it is permission to rip your shirt off, titty fuck you, and to give you a giant Peter North facial. Then he will flip you over and dry fuck your ass until he drops another giant load deep in your colon. He will then make you suck out all of his man goo out of your own ass with a crazy straw. All because you put his hands on your breasts. Be careful what you initiate because it is a crazy world out there with some real freaks.	Yes. Most guys who are timid are so because they are not sure where the acceptable limits are and are afraid to cross them. You putting my hands on your boobs is explicitly saying "grope me" which is the exact kind of blunt invitation someone like me needs.
When you like a girl, what populates your thoughts about her?	I think about sappy couple shit. I'm currently crushing on a girl and I want to invite her over to build pillow forts and watch stupid 80s movies and eat cookies and fall asleep cuddling. I want to go IoA and Disney and parks and have a fairy tale romance. But I am a romantic in a big way about people I genuinely like. I'm getting a steady stream of sex from a FWB so I'm not concerned about sleeping with this girl I like. I'm more interested in the relationship itself.	Along with sex, I romanticize our entire future together. Introducing her to my friends, rainy days at home together, bringing her over for family stuff, fun dates, etc. I really wish I could stop because that just sets a very high expectation that usually lets me down, but I'm a romantic; what can I say?
Do you guys like to be "romanced"?	I don't want to be "romanced" I want the girl to let me romance her, even if it's not her thing.	I feel like people should actively romance each other, whatever that may be to you. For her to dismiss what you'd like sometimes is kinda crappy.
Do you immediately imagine people having sex once they announce that they are pregnant?	I get flashes of them 20 years later with kids that don't talk to them, bills piling up, and their entire life still on hold while they pay off college debt. It's not a good look. All I can think of is "Why would you do that to yourself?"	Totally. Also, every time I'm at a wedding: "These people are going to have sex tonight. They are cutting cake in preparation of having intercourse."
If a girl unexpectedly gets her period while in your bed the morning after a one night stand and has no pads/tampons/cups/etc with her: what's the protocol?	Happened to me about a month ago. Post coital, blood spots on my $200 sheets. Needless to say, she wasn't invited back.	Oh gawd, this happpened to me when I first started seeing my SO. I got out of bed and was reaching for my clothes on the chair when I felt the first trickle. Then, it started gushing. I've been having my period for 8 years now and even I wasn't prepared for the amount of blood - it was like a crime scene between my legs. I couldn't have been more mortified. Even worse, I had chosen not to wear knickers the previous day to surprise him (ladies if you do this, have a spare in your bag). He took it like a champ. He grabbed tissues, helped me mop up the blood on the floor, lent me one of his boxers, sent me straight into the shower and went out to get tampons, coffee and chocolates. And most importantly, never brought it up again.
How do I tell a guy I'm not going to orgasm?	"Hi, this doesn't have anything to do with you, but I'm not going to orgasm. I'm fine if you finish, don't worry about me."	>that I'm not going to orgasm This is ok and most guys have slept with a girl who was similar >and that I would honestly prefer that sex be over as fast as possible. this....is not going to go over well. Most men are ok with no orgasm but will probably feel like shit if you dont enjoy it at all.
Do you have a problem with your girlfriend wearing revealing clothes?	My rule is this, if I'm giving other girls the attention her outfit is attracting and she's ok with it, I'm ok with it too.	I like my wife dressing sexy and as long as they aren't rude or aggressive I don't care if guys check her out. I mean, frankly, it would be a losing battle anyway... with her figure *everything* looks good and it would be ridiculous to get upset over men rubbernecking to look at her... I'd just die angry and tired.
I just had a gorgeous nurse ultrasound my balls. What's the most uncomfortable situation you've ever been in?	I too had a very attractive, young doctor when I went to prep for my operation. It was extremely uncomfortable. My family doctor is also female and I very much dislike having her for a doctor. I would just much rather have male doctors as well. I would say the most uncomfortable situation I've been in recently is a female friend of mine has decided to be a bitch to a bunch of people the past 3 months and we haven't spoken in that time whilst working together until today, and it went badly..lol.	The first time I had a kidney stone and didn't know what it was I freaked the fuck out and drove myself to the hospital convinced I was about to shit my liver while pissing my lungs out. Hot chick doctor. No manscaping and my dick was turtling like a motherfucker cause it was cold and we were scared, so picture a super hot chick reaching through the tangled jungle of my pubic hair to find this tiny little penis trying it's best to suck up inside my body.
Those of you who online date, is there one message that made you go, "Nope!" to a girl who otherwise everything was going well before meeting?	I would think any girl who openly calls herself a feminist without me asking I would stop talking to them. That means you hate all men, not that you want equal treatment for men and women.	Last week I had a girl on tinder who started talking about her evangelical church. WHY ARE U ON TINDER THEN
What is it like to be wanted by women?	If it's your first love that left, and you never really got over her, and now it's 4 years later and she wants you more than you want her it makes you feel like a fucking god. It's like cocaine, but much cheaper and longer lasting. And now we're dating.	Great, if you're attracted to them back. Uncomfortable if you aren't. Though there's a definite ego boost either way. I imagine that's probably how it is in the reverse too.
Does anybody here see themselves not getting married at all?	I will not be getting married because I have no interest in paying some women I used to sleep with half my money for the rest of my life.	I'm not getting married. Although, TBH I was married for about 9 months back in the early 80's. Unfortunately, she didn't understand what marriage meant and got Herpes from her boss. And in one of the most bizarre experiences a human can have, he attempted to buy me a hooker to make up for it. Yeah. That was weird.
How many of you had sex with a girl that you were very unattracted to?	I have. Tho not PIV sex... She was a lesbian who wanted to be fisted in all holes by a man and then cum on her face. I obliged. I also did the same to her gf who was really pretty.	Yes I have. I was recently separated from my wife who cheated on me. Self esteem really took a hit and I went for whatever I could get to make me feel better... it did not make me feel better.
Growing up poor, I find dating women in college who had a much better upbringing than me hard, any advice?	We have had similar experiences growing up. Just wait till you hit the white, upper middle class, white woman who is going to tell you about how your penis makes you privileged, and no matter what you say or do she is going to tell you that you had it good. Far better than she ever did, and does now. How you are the oppressor and she is oppressed so she has the right to treat you like shit. Its coming. I've found university almost unbearable, due to similar experiences. Edit: Apparently /u/parannoyedandroid knows you better than you do. Its already begun! No seriously anyone who thinks what /u/parannoyedandroid wrote is some how accurate, they are delusional.	I can relate, though it's not limited to women. Admittedly the men don't tend to cry as often, but the almost childlike mindset seems similar between the sexes. I'm well beyond college age, so I'm not sure exactly what advice to give. Perhaps avoid the women with this mindset and set your sights on somebody with whom you can find a meaningful connection.
[NSFW] What's your favourite way to make your SO go crazy in bed?	When she isn't expecting it, a light poke in the butthole works. She gets pissed and laughs at the same time.	Pick her up and throw her onto the bed jump on top and pin her arms over her head secure her wrists in the cuffs start kissing her slowly, lower, lower, lower pull her shirt up put my lips just under her belly button and... BELLY RASPBERRY THBBBTTTTBBBBB HAAHAHA drives her bonkers
How do you feel about dirty talk during?	Obviously not as stimulating for males as it is for females in general. For the most part I just stick to basic commands and descriptions of things, or "..ya like that?" kind of talk.	Love it. It can be tricky not to be repetitive though. It's almost like I need a "dirty thesaurus" next to my bed.
Have you ever asked a girl out even though you assumed she would say no?	I have unacceptable skin condition, so asking out is not an option. My action corresponding to your asking out is asking a woman to talk with me. I did that 120+ times in the last 4 and a half years and only this month I've succeeded for the first time. So there were more than hundred times when I assumed they'd refuse, often harshly and vulgarly, and all but one actually did. I guess this is irrelevant to you.	Every single time. So if she says no I won't be disappointed and if she says yes I get a pleasant surprise. And it works. Does it increase my success rate? Sort of, I asked out more people so there is a chance they say yes compared to not asking and not having a chance at all.
Do men tend to stare at a woman's "crotch" area?	You are wearing leggings and tight jeans. That causes men to stare at your crotch. They look to see if they can see anything. A camel toe, lip shape, and hair bulge, anything. It is in from our DNA. We see a good looking female and we want to have sex with her. Immediately. Name, personality, and everything else about her doesn't matter. That is why when guys cheat on their wives or ex-girlfriend and say, "It meant nothing to me.", they are really telling the truth.	Unless there was a very obvious camel toe or something, I would say they are staring at your legs, ass, thigh gap, waist, and/or hips.
What was your most recent frustration with a woman?	I know this is actually the opposite of what should be said in this thread. But I can't remember my last frustration with a woman. My girlfriend is pretty amazing :)	Ugh. She liked me enough to let me catch her if I chased hard enough, but not so much that she'd do any of the moving herself. Fuck that noise. It sucks, because she was cool as hell. Fun to hang out with. But I can't be the one doing everything all the time, you know?
Potentially getting a small apartment with my girlfriend, Men what is your best advice on making it work?	She is going to put her shoes, makeup, bags and whatnot everywhere. Set boundaries and 'I just have more stuff' is *not* a valid argument. Take turns cooking, but who cooks, cleans up. That way, you don't have to clean up after she spent a day having fun trying out new recipes.	I say just make sure you get some you time. Don't spend 24/7 with her. Get out with your friends without her.
I have no friends, no hobbies outside of my computer, and no clear idea of how to improve my life. What should I do?	Jesus man, if you want to join a gym, join a gym. It's not a social place. I spent two hours at my gym today and I only spoke to one person and even then it was just a "hey, how are you" to a girl who I see there every day.	You're not finding "*catch 22s*", you're making excuses to yourself why you can't improve your situation. For whatever reason there seems to be something holding you back emotionally from moving forward. Gyms have personal trainers on offer, hire one, that will solve both your lack of knowledge about exercise and the anxiety. Develop some new hobbies, you don't have to be enticed by them on the outset just willing. You will grow to enjoy them. That takes care of making friends. PS. Going to the gym can also be a venue for making new friends. Look, basically what I am saying is the only thing holding you back here is you. Now, if you're not ready to progress that is absolutely fine no one will judge you for that. But own that you are holding yourself back and why that is the case. Then work through that until you're ready.
Men, can just a person's smell turn you on?	Every time my boy told me I smell great, I wondered if my smell was really special or if he just dated crappy women who smelled terrible.	I can walk down a street, see someone, think meh, then walk past and smell them and think, omg she is delicous. Usually perfume related, but yes a smell is a turn on... or off
How do you guys make friends with women without having them assume you are trying to get into their pants?	Awfully arrogant of them, don't you think? Do you want arrogant people as friends? Sounds like they're doing you a favor and self-screening themselves.	I meet them through my friends and then we all hang out together in a group. If they see you treat them the same as you treat your guy friends, it tends to put them at ease.
Are any men actually attracted to belly button piercings?	What do you mean "actually"? I get compliments for mine all the time... And I am far from trashy, and I do not hangout with what society deems to be "trashy".	I don't hate them, but I also don't care for them. I wouldn't reject someone for having one, but at the same time, a belly button piercing would not make me more attracted to someone.
Men who've been married for a long time, are you still attracted to your wife?	I'm not married but I'm going to answer anyways. Looks fade and that's normal but you stay because you fall in love with the person.	Married 22 years in May. Still attracted to my wife. Her looks have changed, no doubt. She started changing pretty fast when she hit The Change, but I'm still attracted to her despite what she may fear. I try to show her by offering to make out at random moments (parked in the car, at the movie theater, ordering drinks at the local tavern) which never fails to make her blush. Which is good, because that makes her even prettier.
Does anyone else find that girls aren't often physically attractive until you've gotten to know them?	My experience is quite the opposite. I find myself attracted to a great many girls. But the ones I get to know more personally eventually grow comfortable and put less effort into looking nice, which makes me less attracted to them. The happy middle for me is never letting a girl know all my secrets, and never letting her get too comfortable.	I'm interested in hot girls phyiscally, but often times the magic fades the second they open their mouth. Not having a nice personality or any intrinsic qualities is a huge deal breaker for me. Whereas there have been plenty of average girls who I didn't notice at first, but have then absolutely charmed me and I've found irresistable. Getting to know a girl a little is a really critical part of my attraction, I could never take a girl home, do the deed without saying a word and then call her a cab. I wouldn't enjoy that at all. But I have had a few one night things where we've really hit it off and built up a good rapport, *then* gone home.
What is something men do that women tend to read way too much into?	Fucking everything. I swear women just endlessly fret and overthink situations, guys will fret and overthink things before talking to a girl but once they're in a relationship you chill out, women will start overthinking in the relationship and just the most minute comment can become catastrophic.	Being simply polite is often seen as an attempt at flirting. It makes you think to what standards are they accustomed to if simple decency is seen as an attempt to woo them.
Asian guys... how often do you get the "I don't date Asians" line from girls?	It's unfortunate but I can understand the sentiment even if it's not "fair" on you guys. As a white guy I know I'm significantly less attracted to black women in general. I might like them as people but in terms of average sexual attractiveness definitely below average white or Asian girls. It's just preference for me, Kudos for not being the idiot who mistakenly calls it racism though.	I kind of blame media portrayals of Asian men. So often it seems that an Asian dude is the computer nerd, or the villain, but almost never the romantic lead. Which is a shame, as there are any number of Asian actors who could step up to the role, and any number of Asian men who would make excellent partners. I know it's difficult to convince yourself of this, but if a woman is excluding an entire segment of the population due to racism, then it's really her loss.
Would you like to receive an engagement watch?	It's not a matter of 'would'. If she's getting an engagement ring, I'm getting an engagement watch from her. There is zero reason why she should be the only one getting a gift to mark the engagement.	Hell yes. I've been advocating this for the longest time. But the practical person in me would prefer to not exchange anything. It doesn't make sense to start a life with someone by shelling out 20k on a wedding and 10k on a ring. That's bullshit. Ha! I'm on my phone and accidentally type "that's bulkshit" at first. It's bullshit and bulkshit!
Apparently, the co-founder of Tinder is creating a "women-first" dating app where women must make the first move. What are your first impressions of this idea?	It will fail. Women are incredibly lazy when it comes to relationships as they carry the power. Its a game to them.	Seems like it will be self-selecting, and rather than encouraging more women to take the initiative it will just appeal to those who already do. Women who don't want to initiate contact will continue to have the option of every single other dating site/app where they don't have to.
How do you like a woman to treat your dick after a blowjob?	Whatever you do, don't start giving me that "eww, icky, it's gross and sticky" kinda of face or hand gesture. Also, if you aren't swallowing, you should be on cleanup duty. Other than that, you can still stroke it slowly, who knows, I might be up for round 2 in just a bit. Not as much mess 2nd time around, if you catch my drift! ;)	Clean me off with your mouth if you can, then maybe kiss it some and we can cuddle after or something.
Guys who never developed confidence, have you ever managed to be with women? If so, how?	i did get laid a fair number of times back when i had no confidence at all, but that's because i'm good looking enough that a few brave girls pursued me. most guys don't have this luxury, so i suggest yall get to work and get out of your pathetic little comfort zones. sorry to be harsh, but that's the bleak truth.	Well, get ready for a barrage of "fake it till you make it" comments. I for one will not hinder you with such a comment. I don't see many admitting to getting laid without having confidence. I am curious to the comment that will roll in though.
What's the most annoying thing a woman interested in you did?	I started talking to this chick, and was into her then she said she thought 50 Shades of Grey was a good movie and that she also wanted to see Hot Tub Time Machine 2. Killed it for me.	Pouted like a child, had a mini tantrum/huff puff session when I had to go. It almost would have been cute/acceptable if she wasn't dead serious about it like I just took her toy away.
Men, have you ever "lost control" around a woman? If so, what were the repercussions?	No. Women are sacred. If you are going to lose your shit, do it in private or blow off steam with the guys. The only way I've ever come close is to have had difficulties letting go of certain women and this really just hurt me and was a potential annoyance to them. Always be aware of your shit!	I attempted suicide in high school by downing a lot of pills, which thankfully failed but I was hospitalized for a while after. After I took the pills I was wandering around just kind of waiting for it to happen and decided I didn't want to die without at least knowing what a girl felt like and groped a girls tits and ass. Rather aggressively. At the time I was a self centered little shit and deeply regret both the suicide attempt and my actions during. I can't imagine how that effected her later on.
What's your "I'm an idiot" moment that has happened where a girl liked you but you didn't realize it?	Gave me a lot of free drugs, free beer, and responded to all of my flirting, didn't get mad when I spilled said drugs a bit, but I was just trashed so I didn't really keep up with what was going on.	I was out at a party one night when I was 19 and I started chatting to this girl and we kind of hit it off. Anywaaaaaaay, we're flirting and she says "oh gosh my lips feel so chapped, could you check if they're all right ;)" and I, literally with no hesitation, lean right in and get good old look at her lips with my eyes and say "NOPE, they look fine to me!". Haha oh man, good times.
Posted something similar on AskWomen: Guys, what is an attractive trait in women that is undervalued by them, and what is an unattractive trait that is overvalued?	Undervalued: Being skinny Overvalued: Fashion accessories Seriously, though, fat makes a girl drop off the dating radar. Lurking fat people can upvote "being skinny" all they like, but it won't change my preferences.	for me at least, punctuality (no idea if it's *actually* undervalued or not) is really attractive to me. I'm a dude who tries to run like clockwork. If I say I'm going to or told to be somewhere at X time, you better understand that I'm probably going to be early. If we're planning to leave somewhere at a certain time, we're leaving as close to that time as we can. If a girl is always late then I find it a little rude and somewhat inconsiderate. Maybe I'm a little too wound up, but I like being efficient and in my mind, it makes things run smoother.
Men. By around 30 do you think all the best women are off the market?	This sounds like a really shitty perspective to have. Implying that youth is the most valuable quality of a women? I mean, is like someone in their mid twenties an old hag? Because what the hell... single digit age gap is normal, usually not 9 years say but 6? I don't get this question.	Some people would say that if a person isn't married by age 30, there must be a reason behind it. I would say: there is probably a story behind it. Many things in the world are like this. No real reason why it's that way, but there is a story of how it came to be.
Intersectionality: How are men oppressed in our society?	Short answer: Men are not opressed. That however doesn't mean that there are issies that exclusively plauge men and those need to be adressed.	I think men are expected to take anything a woman throws at them, no matter how horrible it might be. But if the roles were reversed, society would expect women to react immediately at the first sign of "abuse" followed up with swift justice. I get it, women have gone through a lot and I hate it when I hear stories of abuse towards women, but it happens to men too and society needs to realize it's a lot more serious than they realize.
Are there any beauty rituals/ grooming you guys do that are still scared to others because it's "too feminine"?	Not really an answer to your question, but I LOVE using those Bioré blackhead strips. It's kind of awesome to see the gunk it pulls out of your skin. I used to do them together with my exgirlfriend.	If anyone calls me a faggot for putting lotion on my face and body, I'll force him to suck my dick.
What are conversations that every couple should have?	Two big ones for me are finances and long-term goals. Good to know if those align with what you are planning in general.	Well, I found this out last night... Apparently you have to clarify that you are in fact one another's SO's. We'd been seeing each other for a couple of months, I being a simple man, assumed that we just were a couple. Thats a lot easier than actually asking her to be my girlfriend. I always assumed that once we were always together, friends had met one another, we clicked she just became my girlfriend, and I her boyfriend. We had this convo last night and I guess we are only now officially boyfriend and girlfriend. Little does she know, she's been my girlfriend for like 2 months.
Do you think society has taken political correctness to an extreme? Are people way too easily offended these days?	Yeah but I think ultimately it's a good thing and changes things for the better. I know people get annoyed by feminists, gay rights, race stuff, SJWs, whiners, complainers, PC people, etc. But the world (maybe just the US?) has gotten so much more progressive in the last decade. I feel like even the most adamant of "activist" haters at least stop and think a bit more when it comes to those issues. Hell, even my father, the most religious, racist, sexist, homophobic person I know has kind of laid off a bit on those issues.	People opposing "political correctness" is a mixed bag. Sometimes it's just "waaah, I can't make racist jokes anymore". But, OTOH, I think some parts of society have become really, really intellectually cowardly. Ideas are starting to rise and fall based not on whether they are true, or even whether they hurt someone, but based on whether they vaguely suggest something is bad.
If you asked a girl out and she said yes but said "I'll let you know when" regarding the day, what would you do?	She doesn't really want to. There is often a huge difference between the words people say and what they really mean. She's not the girl for you. Find others.	She said she'd let you know. If she is interested, she will. If she's not interested, she won't. Taking things like this at face value in an early stage of dating is a very effective and low-cost way of weeding out people who you shouldn't waste your time on because they're not ready to invest the energy required.
What makes a girl "marriage material"? and at this point in your life, does it matter if she is or not?	I'm 26. I'm not looking for marriage, but life partner potential? * Beautiful. * Fit. * Variety of hobbies, the more physical the better. * Has a job she is passionate about and is good at. * Doesn't want kids. * Can put up with my bullshit.	I'm not interested in getting married anytime soon, but for a girl to even remotely register on my radar for it, she'd need to be: 1.) Someone I can consistently rely on and trust. 2.) Someone that is financially independent. 3.) Someone that I can share lots of my interests with. 4.) Someone who takes care of her mental and physical health. At this point in my life, with me having no interest in matrimony, I'm pretty flexible on this, but honestly, these are the ideal traits for any romantic partner, marriage or no marriage.
What do you think can/should be done about male suicide, depression, and mental illness in general?	Slow change in cultural issues surrounding vulnerability and expression for males. Have parents tell their sons that it's okay to show emotion (within reason, of course) and ignore toxic masculine ideas. And for the adults, figure out what works for men in dealing with suicide and depression/ mental illness. We hear so much that x was designed for men, and women have their own needs associated with x. I think it's similar, men may not benefit from women and children's support systems simply repackaged for men.	Destigmatizing mental illness and providing treatment are good, but they're band-aids. I want to know why my fellow men are so depressed and suicidal. What are the underlying causes? Is there anything we can do to prevent men from needing treatment in the first place?
Should I break things off so early on due to difference in sex drive?	2 weeks? You deserve someone who makes you feel attractive and wanted, life is too short to settle for someone who only thinks you're good looking enough to have sex with once every 2 weeks.	Life is short, op. seriously. If I had a to do over, I wouldn't put up with that stuff. If you haven't been going out for very long, find someone else... Or at the bare minimum do not make it exclusive.
Why is flexible sexy?	The sex positions thing is utter bullshit, people just say it reflexively honestly. Think about it...if you were banging a really attractive girl who was flexible, would you even want to fold her into a pretzel? Is that sexy? Of course not. No one actually does positions like that, you barely even see them in porn. You're fucking, not performing a circus act. Flexible women are usually athletes (gymnasts, dancers, ballerinas) which is automatically feminine and sexy. They're in shape and they're good at something that is unique. Athleticism is a big turn on, for me. And I always think ballerina. I have a huge thing for ballerinas.	For me, it just oozes athleticism, which I find highly alluring. I've definitely noticed a correlation between flexibility and fitness.
Has anyone ever dated or become friends with a *former* celebrity (child star for ex. or just someone who had been out of the spotlight for awhile)?	a friend's sister was on the MTV show "jersey shore." none of the cast members were portrayed in a great light, but she is actually a very nice, down to earth and quiet person.	I had a piano lesson with harry connick Jr once. He taught me this awesome lick. I also told him to go play portal and he didn't have any meaningful acting or music roles afterwards for a while.
What was your "Fuck, I need to turn my life around" moment?	Got up one morning and decided it had been a while since masturbating and having sex and i was gonna get a hooker. Dont regret it one bit but afterwards all i could think was that was great but deadliftings better. Gone from 80kg to 140kg in 3 weeks.	College drop out. Moved back to my parents place and would regularly sleep in until 6pm since I stayed up playing video games all night. One day my friend told me "if your true love could see how you live for 24hrs. What would she think?" That was a good kick in the ass.
What actually impresses you in a girl compared to what girls think impresses you?	I'm not impressed by clothes, makeup and hair. Infact, I'm offput by someone who would spend any significant amount of time or money on any of them. I'm actually impressed with intelligence, openness, honestly, groundedness and a sense of humour.	Having and maintaining hobbies when they're in a relationship. I've seen girls say they read, hike, and do other stuff suddenly stop when they're seeing someone so they can spend all their time with the person.
How do you get attractive photos of yourself?	To get an attractive photo, follow these steps: 1: Be attractive 2: Don't be unattractive 3: Take a photo with you in it. You now have an attractive photo of yourself. If you're unattractive (which is essentially a antonym for photogenic) you're shit out of luck. But most people are, so its ok.	The only good pictures of me are when I'm laughing or extremely disheveled from a long day where I stayed awake way too long and not smiling. For me, just flat out smiling makes me look like I had an arrangement with the pavement.
Guys who had horrible, manipulative relationships, why did you put up with it?	I didn't really accept it was manipulative and toxic. Women are far better at mind games than men. Added to that, men are trained to believe it's not possible that way round.	Because of the manipulative part. A good manipulator makes you feel like this is what it's supposed to be like, will threaten you into staying, will invalidate your feelings. Only when the relationship ends and you feel 10000x better do you realize how bad it actually was for you.
Do you ever crave sex with another woman, even though you still deeply love your SO?	As a female I really don't think you needing to "spread your seed" is an asshole feeling. It's what our species relies on. If my SO didn't think about having sex with other women I would honestly be worried. I would rather he spoke to me about it but if it was just sex then I would probably be okay with it. Also sex doesn't = love, it's just a part of it.	Wanting to do something never makes you an asshole. What you do is what defines you, not what you think. I personally want to brutally murder most people I see on a day to day basis but I don't, that doesn't make me a sociopath. You're fine, just don't cheat on her and you're doing the right thing.
Men: How persistent are you in asking/pushing for sexual activities that your SO doesn't want to do? How many times would you ask your SO to do something before giving up?	Im overly persistent I need to work on it. And the same time sometimes when my girlfriend eventually does it she finds out she likes it. I need to be less persistent. She needs to be more open to trying things that she'll likely enjoy.	I'm not persistent at all. It should be fun for both, not "I'll allow it so you shut up." because that's not as much fun.
Men! Have you ever considered whether or not you were being 'sexy' or do you consider this to be an exclusively female condition?	It's not exclusively female but it is much harder to be sexy as a guy. Tall, ripped, rich. Get two of these.	Hah, my default feeling is that my very existence is awkward, but once a girl gives me an indicator that she's interested, I feel like the very embodiment of Adonis. Confidence is attractive, and when I feel confident, I feel more attractive.
TIFU by biting a girl in the vag. Any advice?	So why exactly CAN'T you apologize for hurting her and then let her know that this was it and you are not interested in her anymore? You make it all sound like she tortured you, but you chose to go down on her and then it went awkward. Just man up and deal with the results.	Abort mission. Register everyone as KIA. Change your name to Paco and head to Costa Rica to start a new life as a goat herd. It's really your only play.
Do you guys enjoy the feeling of having a woman in your passenger seat?	What I like to do is turn up the heat so that she takes off her sweater. And then I turn on the AC so I can see her nipples get hard through her T-shirt.	Yep. And this might be atypical, but when they fall asleep is just a little ego boost. Something about them being feeling comfortable/safe enough with me and my driving to curl up in my passenger seat and trust that I'll get them there is nice. Especially if they told me they never sleep in cars or it's a difficult situation that makes almost anyone nervous like NYC traffic, a blinding snowstorm, etc.
What kinds of AskMen threads are the saddest to read?	The ones from the depressed guys who don't get how to get laid and make women attracted to them, and who get butthurt, angry and downvotey when you tell them how because it doesn't match their (obviously failing) worldview on the matter.	The kind where you see a normally decent guy getting so fucked up by rejection/horrible people that he starts to drift into extremist views to somehow manage and cope with all that has happened around him.
Do you feel as though women (in general) demand and expect too much from men, while they fail to meet or fulfill your expectations?	Dating is, and always has been, incredibly gynocentric, and with the legitimisation of the "women are wonderful" (ie, "anything they do is awesome") effect, it's only gotten worse.	Being too immature for a healthy relationship is not a gendered issue. My list of women who fit that category is bigger because I'm straight. I'm sure there are just as many immature guys out there.
Do you feel that there should be stronger criminal penalties for falsifying abuse/rape?	I don't know if putting them on the sexual offenders registry is the best solution. I think something like sentencing them to do community service (like maybe at a woman's shelter, where there are real survivors of abuse) and forcing them to better the community would be a better option than wasting more tax payer dollars on prisoners.	Definitely. If someone falsely accuses someone of rape, that should of course be dealt with as a serious issue. An accusation of rape can ruin someones life, just the accusation on its own, so if someone falsely accuses, they should face a penalty that takes that into account.
What do you do with your eyes while going down on a girl?	I'm shocked to see all the people here saying they close their eyes. How do you know what you're doing? I never close my eyes when I'm going down on a guy...	Look at her face. Look at her boobs to grab a handful. Look at her pussy to make sure you're doing what she likes. You're thinking too much.
When did you start to realize that some women actually found you attractive?	I knew Very early on in college. Dated the prettiest girls in my class, told by plenty of women that im attractive and I've never been rejected by a woman. Granted, some of that is how carefully I choose partners or fwb's. But i know for a fact its also because of how i look. Its a double-edged sword though because rejection is an experience EVERYONE should have in their life.	Around 21 I noticed girls looking at me. At first I was like, "Shit WTF am I doing?? Do I have a booger or something hanging from my nose, am I unconsciously leering at these woman? What am I doing wrong?!" It was only after I started becoming decently successful with woman that it dawned on me, "Oh, they're looking at me because I'm attractive." Also, did anyone else go through like a "second" puberty in their twenties? I was awkward and chubby all through my teens, but I filled out and developed muscles in my twenties. Now I'm 26, and I honestly think I look a lot better than I did at, say, 19.
Is a straight man not wanting to have a threesome with another man being selfish?	Nah, fuck that. A threesome is 2 girls and 1 guy. 2 guys and 1 girl is running a train. Source: Black Phillip.	If he's uncomfortable having a threesome with another man in it then I think she should accept that. But at the same time, if she's uncomfortable having a threesome with another woman in it then he should also accept that. I don't think it's hypocritical to say "I'm not comfortable having a threesome with someone of the same gender as me, but if you're comfortable doing it with someone as the same gender as you then I'd be interested in that". What's hypocritical would be saying "I won't do it but I expect you to".
What do a lot of women misunderstand about the dating experience of the "average man"?	Most of these responses are about sex.....aaaaand make the dudes saying them look like huge ass holes. Or 17 years old. I would say most chicks don't appreciate the effort guys put in. Women take for granted that they are the desired one in the situation, men are putting in effort for you to like them. So I think chicks are too quick to say "I wasn't impressed" or something like that and move on, instead of saying "he was a really nice guy, maybe a little awkward, but thats not bad maybe he was nervous".	That I actually want intimacy and not just somebody to stick my dick in. How incredibly frustrating it can be when you have to initiate everything and you're not good at it. How invisible you can feel to women who are just as average as you are or even below average. Developing feelings for a female friend can happen very easily and it doesn't mean I was just spending time with you to try and get in your pants.
What is a quality you thought you wanted in a significant other, but eventually learned wasn't compatible with you?	Thought I wanted an equal partner. Nope. I need a woman who is cool with me being the head of the household.	Someone who looked up to me. I thought that for awhile. It turns out, it's exhausting pretending to be a rock for someone else's emotions. I later thought I wanted the other opposite: complete independence. It turns out, that's draining as well. It's difficult being with someone who treats you as expendable, and enjoys reminding you of it. It may be fair, but it's not comforting.
Dating rule: "Who cares least wins." How did we get here?	It has nothing to do with what you're talking about. Basically what it means is don't invest everything into a single date that'll leave you devastated if it doesn't work out. Statistically these things don't work out more than they do. So when you're banking on it and subsequently placing giant expectations on something that's supposed to be casual, you're setting yourself up for failure. None of that means don't put any effort into a date, just don't expect anything from it. Edit: I think where the problem lies is that, judging on the men who post here, guys don't come across these opportunities often. So when they get them they put this overwhelming amount of pressure on themselves and the date to succeed, because who knows when they'll get this opportunity again?	"Who cares least wins" is just a way of expressing how a power dynamic that is common in many types of relationships is also part of romantic relationships. For example, imagine you own a company which sells almost all of its products to wal-mart, and wal-mart wants to change the terms of your contract. In this little scenario, wal-mart doesn't care much about your business at all, but you care about wal-mart's business because it is super critical to your company's survival. When you negotiate, wal-mart has all the power because wal-mart barely cares what happens. It is not advice to try to be an unfeeling robot, but a warning that if your partner doesn't really care about the relationship, your partner is the one with the power to dictate what happens.
What's a common sentiment on r/AskMen that makes you feel bad or insecure?	Not super common, maybe, but there seems to be a bias that circumcised men are somehow less than uncircumcised. I just don't get it.	I've seen a lot on here that could easily cause insecurities or negativity, but I've learned that you REALLY can't let what you read online affect you that way. You never know who's behind the screen, in the end they are anonymous strangers...let your actual experiences guide you, not the opinions of an anonymous niche website.
Have you ever met or dated someone that you thought was nearly perfect except for one (or a few things) that became a deal breaker?	Yup. She was pretty much everything I wanted... extremely attractive, seriously intelligent, funny as all get out, introspective... We dated for months and were really smitten with each other and the sex was great. We were having a discussion about gender issues one night when she revealed to me that she firmly believed in bullshit "patriarchy" theory and how easy men have it. After all of my life's struggles I just could not abide someone thinking that I had it easy because I'm white and have a cock.	Yep. She was hot, intelligent, had the same sense of humour and made it clear she was very attracted to me. The problem was that she was seeing about three other dudes at the same time, one of which was her ex, ending in her going radio silent. Welcome to online dating.
Do men get scared walking home alone at night, too?	It would be stupid for anyone not to be scared about walking home alone at night, especially depending on the area you live in. But at the same time, there's this prevailing idea that women should always be *really* scared when they're alone. Not just when it's dark or late or if they're in a bad area, but everywhere. It makes all women a lot more afraid than they should be. Especially when you consider that men are more likely to be the victims of violent crime.	I get jumpy in bad areas. My response is closer to extreme wariness instead of just fear. I start checking corners as a approach them, checking my six frequently, keeping an eye out for escape routes if I need to bolt. Situation awareness is comforting.
How do I confront my roommate about his girlfriend being over too much?	Wait, I'm a little bit confused. Is she an economic drain on you/the household? Like is she monopolizing the living room couch, eating all of the food or anything else but hanging out in your roommates space? Because if it's just a matter of you not liking her there, this is a situation I'd advise to "suck it up." I get that it's frustrating that your roommate isn't listening to you, but (and maybe I just suck at reading) it almost sounds like jealousy on your part.	I had a friend who went through almost this exact scenario. Except it was her, two male room-mates, and one of their girlfriends. And when she complained that the girlfriend was there all the time and not contributing to the rent or anything they got really petty and started being dicks to her. She ended up going to the landlord, because the place was in her name, and basically demanding he do something about it. She basically was saying "this is violating my lease agreement" (they usually have rules about how often guests can stay), and that they could either stop the girlfriend from being there so often, or let her out of her lease agreement. It isn't the best solution, but if you a roommate who isn't showing you any respect, sometimes being hostile is the way to go.
When was the last time you were really creeped out by someone?	Well, my male friend and I got catcalled by some girls who drove past us while we were walking on the sidewalk. They leaned out the windows, gestured with their arms and yelled something like "woohoo!" Obviously I didn't really mind, but it struck me that women complain about men behaving that way toward them and then they turn around and do it to us. Or at least these women did.	Weird guy at the gym always stares me down. Like every day this dude gives me death stares. We've only ever had one interaction, he asked me if I needed a spotter and I said I was good. That's it, now I have a creepy enemy.
She says I'm being ridiculous, I beg to differ. I need outside opinion. Am I being unreasonable?	Women will forgive even the worst faults of an attractive man. Women will not forgive even the best virtues of an unattractive one. A high status man who talks with his fists (not that Chris Brown is actually that bad, she hit him first), is much more attractive to women than a gentle, boring loser. Don't push this issue so far that you become the gentle, boring loser.	Honestly you shouldn't let your gf ruin your vacation and if she feels that way about it, you shouldn't try to change her opinion just because of how you feel. If she wants to go to the concert, you could go to a casino or something and meet up afterward. It sounds like you have a great trip planned and you shouldn't let something trivial like this ruin the vacation. That said, I completely agree with you on the Chris Brown domestic violence thing, but if she's using her money and not making you go to it, I can't really see why you couldn't just let her go. In a relationship you're not always going to agree on everything, so why sweat the small stuff when something much more serious may come along?
Why are there so many lonely guys out there?	Because women suck, that's why I'm single and have been all my life; so far. Only 20. I'm a desperate, anxious, self-loathing, misogynistic, piece of shit person and I blame it on feminism and the overall misandry in this world, specifically in the U.S. Women have no feelings, have no sympathy/empathy for others; especially men, and are selfish part of the species. Men go on being rejected and no body cares, the moment a woman gets rejected, she gets her own damn tv show made about it, it's ridiculous. Oh yeah....screw women's problems, sick of hearing about their shit when I've got; men have got, their own problems.	For me is not about dating, it's about the fact that for my entire life, nobody has invited me to anything. Not to hangout, not to play sports, not to a birthday party or any other party or anything. I always have to invite myself. After a while it gets to the point where you realize that nobody really cares if you are around or not. Every stage of my life has been like this and to me, that makes me feel incredibly lonely.
Men, what are your deal breakers?	Mine are: * Feminist/SJW/Racist/General Asshole * Majored in Gender Studies (most likely a useless asshole) * Triggered Easy (most likely a weak asshole) * Too far to either side of the US political Spectrum * STDs * Previously having a penis * Shitty Taste in Music/Movies/Media * 420 Friendly preferred, but not required. * Alcohol Friendly preferred, but not required.	During a beautiful, scenic drive through the mountains on a cool fall day, a girl I was dating decided to throw her bag of McDonalds trash out the window.
Does it ever bother you to know that people in your age group are much more successful than you?	There are people not in my age group a lot more successful than I am, too. Doesn't bother me either way.	“The only time you look in your neighbor's bowl is to make sure that they have enough. You don't look in your neighbor's bowl to see if you have as much as them.”
What ended up being a deal breaker in your relationship that you didn't think would bother you at the start?	The drugs, man. I thought it would be cool dating a chick that liked to party, but ye gods it got on top of her and nearly ruined me. Not to make blanket statements (well, here's one coming up), at least not to make blanket statements with negative intent, women cannot handle drugs. If your girl looks like she's getting hooked on something, dump her.	She talked a lot, which didn't bother me at first because I'm quiet, but that quickly turned into "Jesus fucking Christ does she ever shut up?"
Do people really think there is no difference between having a height preference and having a weight preference?	Yes. One is related to an attribute that can be changed (weight) and the other one to something which can't (height). So, don't let anyone shame you for having weight-requirement(s), just be smart enough to not broadcast the preference for everyone to hear. >/r/AskWomen I wouldn't take anything said on that wretched place too seriously.	Judging people for what they like or do not like is just silly. If someone does not like fatties, fine. If someone does not like skinnies, fine.
Men, am I the ass?	Find a new girlfriend. Its been my experience that girls who are that emotionally needy will never be satisfied with anything less than 100% of your attention. Doesn't matter if its video games or hanging out with your buddies, its always a problem. You have to have a healthy amount of "you" time to decompress and unwind. If yours is video games and browsing the internet that's great. I'm assuming she never leaves the house to do anything with her friends, or spend anytime to herself right? Of course she does. Its an unfair double standard. She can get her "me" time in when you're at work, as she is jobless and has that kind of free time. I was in your shoes in my last relationship, I got out, and haven't been happier. Best of luck	No one's wrong here. Both of you just see things differently. You see it as you spend time with her every night watching a movie, eating, and sleeping. She sees that as she only sees you at night at home. She probably wants to go out on dates or even just spend time with you out of the house. I understand you're tired from working all week but I've heard the advice to "date your SO" and I believe that's true. Don't stop doing the things you did to get her. EDIT: But yeah she needs to do something to keep her busy. Whether it's get a job, or hobbies, or hang with her own friends. I've been in a relationship where her life was me, me, me. It didn't end well But I do know where you're coming from, trust me
How do your personal experiences clash with the common consensus you see on the Internet?	I honestly don't believe there's such a thing as a radical feminist, and cherrypicked tumblr posts aren't evidence. Feminism is about equal rights, and the majority of people that go on reddit are feminists, even if they don't classify themselves as ones.	Internet dating is difficult. I know so many couples that have met via it. (we were at a wedding reception on Saturday, and met 4 other couples who meet via okcupid)
I have never dated a guy who expected me to pay for anything. Am I just lucky or is this the norm?	You haven't met me. Any indication that you expect me to pay for you and you're out the door. It's curious that I've been actually called a sexist in real life when admitting that I'd never pay for a woman on a date.	My coworker is paying all of the rent for him and his girlfriend, at $1400 a month. Poor bastard. I think it's more common for the guy to pay for everything in cases where he makes good money and she doesn't. Outside of that case, it's a lot more even I think. It's typically a realistic assessment of what makes sense financially for both people.
What was the most NSFW you did drunk/high?	Well, there was that time I had sex on a bathroom floor during a party, or the other time I started giving my boyfriend a handjob in the theater while watching rocky horror. Oooh oh my favorite, one night I was drunk at a club with my friends I chugged half a bottle of vodka before even going in. Half way through the night I was making out with some chick trying to convince her to have a 3-way with me and my boyfriend. Unfortunately he didn't see my texts until the next morning...	Have you ever heard of the Whiskey dick? I love whiskey, because many times it has prevented me from having sex I would highly regret.
How do you feel about girls who meow?	I have a friend who meows to songs, sometimes without realizing she does it. Just a random quirk that turns into a series of jokes. No biggie.	Sometimes its okay. It depends on the settling. For example it's okay if: * You are meowing to a cat. * You are wearing cat ears in an appropriate setting. (ie halloween, sex club) * You're talking to Jim Gaffigan. I'm sure there are more, but those are okay in my book.
Men who didn't like themselves as younger people, then became high-self esteem individuals - HOW?	Oh I still hate myself, I've just become better about repressing it into a little ball of festering, stewing self hatred that I fear will one day reach critical mass.	Hated myself growing up because of toxic family/never had friends after middlescool/some other stuff. Fast forward, I was told I had avoidant personality disorder. Realizing it helped a lot, but the biggest boost was just pretending I was a confident normal somewhat social person. I literally lied to myself and to others about being a good person when I thought inside I was literally Hitler. Apparently Fake it until you Make it can be a pretty true phrase. I'm a somewhat well adjusted person now and pretty god damn confident in my self to boot. TLDR: Have you tried not having low self esteem?
You ever been super attracted to a girl that , not that many other guys also found attractive?	Perfectly curvy in the right places though fat. Lol BBW? Not grotesque morbid fat. Okay looking face wise does not wear makeup too often doesn't need it my opinion. Very effing cute. Describing some girls I've fallen for who work retail.	There's this girl I sometimes see around who I think is cute. It said to my friend she's underrated, and he got this look of disgust on his face and just turned back to looking at his phone, with no comment.
Guys, what are your "woman being really inappropriate and borderline sexually harassing me" stories?	I work in restaurants, so its come up before. Worst was when I was 16, working for a pizza joint. I was at the nearest intersection (a major corner, right up the street from my High School) holding a sign advertising our special, when a car waved me over. Normally, people ask where we are ( kinda out of the way) so I didn't think anything of it. Nope. She asked me " How much for the pepperoni?" Thinking she meant the sign, I looked down and then back up, but she threw me a wink and said " No, for YOUR pepperoni! " Thankfully, the light turned green and she drove off. Worst part was her two elementary school age daughters in the back seat were listening and trying to stop her...	I used to work in an office with all women, and many times they'd carry on conversations about hot dudes, sex, and bodily functions that I've seen women complain about from men. They'd also flirt with me, hug me, rub my head, and even sit on my lap even though they knew I had a girlfriend who was not okay with that.
There was a thread where one of the most unattractive things to men was women that were overweight, even by 10 pounds. Can you show me what being 10 pounds overweight looks like to you?	As has been mentioned, it depends on the woman, how tall she is, how big her boobs are, yadda yadda yadda. Personally though, I'd say 10 pounds normally isn't that noticeable, but I'd say any time you see a girl in a t-shirt or a dress and you can see her stomach bloating it out, that's the "fat" line.	It depends where the 10 pounds are. A 5'3" thin girl with huge boobs and a big ass could be several pounds heavier than a 5'3" girl with small boobs and a flat ass.
If a girl took sexual advantage of me when I was extremely drunk, am I a rape victim?	You would be in court, if not jail, right now with your reputation in tatters if the roles were reversed here, much like the bloke who had fully consensual sex with the mattress-carrying girl in the USA. So I'd say you are a rape victim here and should seek vindication in whatever ways possible.	For me, it very much depends on how capable and lucid you were at the time. If someone has sex with you and you were too physically too drunk to prevent it happening, then yes, you have every right to describe it as rape. That's very different than where you choose to have sex in an inappropriate situation because you're inebriated and then feel uncomfortable about it later (even if the other person is stone sober and a manipulative sleazeball). Only you can really know where you fall on that scale.
What is the sweetest thing a SO has ever said to you?	"You are the most serious from everyone here". I was dirty, on a PC playing UT, drunk and with a beard too long to be sanitary. I still can't figure out what she meant.	It wasn't something she said. It was something she did. So I guess that means actions mean more to me than words. There used to be a time when her job required her to be at work earlier than I did, and my schedule was about an hour and half behind hers. So there were mornings when she'd take a shower, get dressed and ready, but before leaving she'd climb under the covers, straddle me, put her face to mine and nozzle me until I woke up. Then she'd leave for work and I'd get up and do my morning routine with the smell of her lingering in my nose. One of the best things in life, ever.
Have you ever intentionally turned a girl off to avoid rejecting her?	That's how most of my relationships end. When I'm ready to break up I just fuck up for a couple of weeks until they dump me.	Sure I found out what her pet peve was and started doing it in front of her. She liked me and I had no interest at all and it was going to cause issues in a friend group. So I learned that she hated people who talked all the time about partying so I just mentioned it around her a lot and that made her lose interest. It could not have worked out better because she them moved on to my friend who liked her and then I was able to drop that act.
What are you an elitist about?	Clothes, especially shoes. I try not to be a snob about it, but it's tough when friends keep telling me about the "awesome" new thing they bought, and asking what I think of it/how it looks. It's usually pretty bad/shabby/cheap, and I refuse to lie about it, so the best response I come up with is silence with raised eyebrows. It's not a *great* response, but at least it's not, "That's tacky and I would be embarrassed to wear it."	Design. Holy fuck, does bad design piss me off. Several times a year, I get a Chinese menu delivered to my house that is rife with bad photoshopped images, poor spelling and on one occasion, you had to turn the menu upside down to read the last two pages. Ugh. Additionally, when good design is held back by something like shite kerning or garish colour schemes, that's the worst. Yeah, I'm weird.
What do you guys say when your girl says she's "fat"?	This is a red flag. There's no right response, because if she does in fact feel this way, then she needs to address the root cause, and you can't do that for her. If she's saying it just to see what you'll do, she's being manipulative. Neither is a sign that predicts a relationship where you won't (a) be constantly providing validation so that she can avoid dealing with her own issues, or (b) being manipulated. Talk to the girl about how you feel. If it doesn't stop, think about moving on.	My wife and I are pretty honest with one another. Sometimes, we gain a bit of weight (she will gain up to 8 lbs at most). So, when she says that she's getting fat, I reassure her that she's still hot (because she is) and that, if she wants, I'll help her drop some of it. I do most of the cooking and I'll motivate her to go on more runs/walks, so I can help in some small ways. In any case, I don't think it's anything to get upset about unless she does it all the time without taking action. If she's gaining, it's not hard to make a couple of lifestyle changes and reverse the process (assuming she is smaller and doesn't have issues with her weight already).
Men of reddit, how unlikely are you to date a woman who is looking to settle down and have kids in the next couple years?	The issue you'll run into is the usual narrative: "I screwed around in my early 20s with shitty guys and now I'm past my prime I want to settle down with someone I'm marginally attracted to with a stable job to support me and my children." To most guys this reads as settling for a wallet, whether or not that's what you specifically are doing.	You have to make him feel that you want a baby with him, not that you want a baby and .... eh... He'll do the trick.
What's something women do that's essentially shooting themselves in the foot when trying to meet guys?	Being overly interested in me. Sorry, there was someone else at the table too. At least try to act like we were there as three people not 2 + 1. Did I even look like I was interested? You're nice enough, but no.	Not show signs of interest. A conversation can be just that; a platonic conversation. To actually show interest and make the guy know you are into him is another point.
What are your lesser-known tips for improving your appearance?	Keeping your body fat % relatively low. Studies show that women are most attracted to men around 10% body fat, as it signals a strong immune system.	Say you have to be out the door at 7. AM, PM, doesn't matter. I can get dressed in 10 minutes if I'm being slow. However, if I get dressed at 6:50, I usually end up making mistakes, not looking over myself more carefully. Get ready at least 30 minutes before going out.
Men with disabilities, how does your disability affect your dating life?	Somehow, being short seems a little less unpleasant after reading these comments, even though I haven't had a "date" in more than thirty years.	My left ear is deaf. I feel stupid always having to ask girls to repeat themselves. So a lot of time i just smile and nod, or laugh when they do and have no fucking idea whats going on. I once asked a girl if she wanted to meet me at a bar. No idea what she said. So i just said cool and went about my way. Then went there and waited to see if she was showing up or not.
What's the meanest or rudest thing you did as a kid because you didn't know any better?	I was in first grade and was learning Spanish colors. My family took me to a restaurant and I saw a black couple... I pointed at them and said "Negro Negro!" excitedly. I then got explained to why that wasn't exactly appropriate.	My family didn't have much money when I was growing up. Hand-me-down clothes, small apartment in a bad neighborhood, etc but I attended a small private school where my mom worked. Her employment there allowed me to go for a deep discount. All my friends were rich white kids. I was probably about 6 years old and I asked for a toy, my mom told me she had just paid rent and we couldn't afford it. I SCREAMED at her in the middle of the store that she could work harder so we wouldn't be poor. My mom worked 60 hours a week to give me a good education. I'll never forget the look on her face when I said that.
When was the last time somebody told you they were proud of you?	Saying you're proud of someone is pretty patronizing. I mean, it's okay coming from a parent. But if my boss or a friend said they were proud of me I'd flinch ask who the eff they thought they were to say something like that.	My wife does so regularly. She actually has a little song she sings, which her mother sang/sings to her. *I'm proud of you,* *I'm proud of you,* *I'm ve-ry, ve-ry proud of you!* *I'm proud of you,* *So proud of you,* *And I hope you're proud of you too.* It, and she, are adorable. That being said, and recognizing that is silly and childish, I do thoroughly enjoy it when she sings the I'm proud of you song.
What frustrates you the most about the dating world?	It's really, really difficult for me not to rant about women's hypocrisy and unrealistic expectations about dating. That's what annoys me the most, but it's a really touchy subject. "*sigh* Why cant I find a nice guy for once." "What about this guy I know?" "Mmm..too overweight/short." *throws hands in the air, rolls eyes and walks away*	I feel like, as a guy, I'm expected to do most of the work -- at least to get things started -- even though I probably care less than most women about being in a relationship in the first place.
What are your thoughts on the new Reddit as a "Safe Place" policy and the banning of controversial subreddits like fatpeoplehate?	First they came for the fat haters. And I said "good riddance" because they were assholes. Then they came for the racists. And I said "good riddance" because they were also assholes. Then reddit became a much more tolerable site.	Banning a subreddit does nothing but incite them, as we are experiencing now. Ban individuals, remove mods, even get the proper authorities involved if it gets to that, but trying to remove an entire community (I use that word loosely) will solve nothing. I don't know what they thought they would accomplish.
What is the best equivalent of "buying flowers for your girlfriend" that I can do for my boyfriend?	the two girl blow job is always a favorite. you might have to ask a few of your friends before you find one willing, but he'll be grateful.	If he drinks, a nice bottle of whatever he likes to drink. seeing as 'flowers/chocolate/wine' all sound like they go together as a romantic gift, you can do something similar with liquor and some other food.
My boyfriend says I don't understand the subtle aggression between men when they don't know one another but are in conflict/competition for something. Is there a whole other meta game that I'm unaware of governing how men react with one another?	I don't know how old you guys are, but to me he sounds like a teenager trying to look tough. Sure, anyone can escalate to violence when necessary, but not for something as trivial as a shoulder bump in the street.	Is nobody going to mention the fact that they casually bumped into each other and then the girl immediately started talking about how they were out celebrating her new job having a few drinks? Honestly this stranger doesn't really give a shit about that.
Old men of Reddit: What was the key to your successful marriage?	Woman here with a general comment. A lot of you are mentioning romance (including sexy time and just together time). For me, vulgarity is the opposite of romance. I can't seem to make my husband understand that, while I'm not a prude, distasteful and crude language will ensure no sex for at least two days because it completely turns me off. Not just off sex, but I don't want to even hang out with him because I am truly disgusted. So please guys, know your woman!! A lot of women would not give two shits about this, but I do, and I bet I'm not alone here.	When arguing with your SO, the goal isn't to win the argument. The goal is to solve a problem. Nobody is a fucking mind reader, so don't go to your SO with *you should know why I'm upset* bullshit. If you're doing things to intentionally hurt your SO, you're an idiot. The strongest relationships come from two strong, happy individuals coming together, not two broken individuals relying on each other for happiness.
Does it ever piss you off when another person tries to tell you how to do something you know how to do? What do you do or say?	It used to. Then I grew up. Let people teach you. It makes them feel better and makes you look like a fast learner. You might even learn something in the process. If they find out later that you obviously know your shit, it makes you look like a good person for taking time to listen to them.	There's a great buddhist story about this. I'm not a buddhist, so I'm probably going to get the details wrong. Gist is: a buddha --whose meditation practice had led him to enlightenment-- was wandering the land. He kept running into "meditation teachers" who offered to give him instruction and guidance on how to meditate. His response, as a master? He hung on their every word, and when they were finished with their "instruction" he thanked them profusely and humbly went on his way. He made no attempt to teach or correct them, unless they asked. It's a story about pride and ego.
What is the one bad opinion you have about your male friends which you will never tell them?	You're a looser: fat, without much social interaction and you think of yourself a thousand times stronger and more intelligent than you are.	Friend 1: I don't think you should marry the girl you're about to marry. Friend 2: I hate how you turn every conversation into a diatribe on the war against drugs. Friend 3: I used to worry for your future because you were never particularly bright and struggled immensely in school. But holy shit have you turned things around. Proud of you, buddy.
[UPDATE] Do your friends hit on your wife?	The title is misleading, and should be "Do your friends have affairs with your wife?" I'm not calling you out on anything here, but just trying to point out: the fact you didn't phrase it that way tells me you already know your friend and your wife have broken faith with you. That it's far beyond what's normal or acceptable in any relationship. I haven't been in your situation, and can't imagine the betrayal you feel. Neither of them respected you at all in their behavior. Have an (actual) friend and you just go out for a night and talk to him about it. Getting it off your chest and/or raging about it is something any good friend should be able to help you out with. Nobody's going to have your asshole ex-friend's back on this one.	Your wife and friend were flirting with eachother in front of you..... What the fucking fuck. She and him were having fun thinking about how they were fucking while you were right there. She is not a good person. Period. This wasn't a drunk night (which is still a bullshit excuse). This was thought out and flagrant. Talk to a lawyer and get her out of the house and future you were working hard (and faithfully) to build. Congrats of not shooting up the place. I'm so mad right now and I'm not even involved. Stay as calm as you can and stay smart. Keep an extra eye on your finances. Hell, check your and her credit reports to make sure she hasn't taken out any debt you don't know about that you may be on the hook for.
Children of parents who fight a lot, what's the most ridiculous thing your parent has told you after an argument with their spouse?	This is going back to the 80s. My mom used to tell me that "Kids need a father, that's the reason I stay with him." Which to 8 year old me meant "You're the reason I'm so horribly unhappy." My childhood sucked and I'm pretty sure it's why I have no romantic life and very little social life. What I learned about romance and marriage and such turned me off from women in general. And unfortunately, every woman I've ever dated or tried to date reinforced the notion that I'm just not cut out for love.	My mom and dad came home after a day out and were arguing about something and it was a pretty bad to the point where my mom was crying and she said to me, 'One day it might just be you and me'. I never thought my parents would get divorced and I was about 9 so I cried. The next day my mom and dad made up and my mom told me to disregard what she said.
Has a woman ever told you she didn't want to have sex with you because she doesn't feel good about her own body?	No. If she did or thought like that, it'd mean she had very low self-esteem and needed to work on it by herself.	Here's a female POV, if you care for it. Truthfully, after reading her reason, my reaction was, "Wow, she's being really honest with him." It does sound like she has some deep-rooted insecurities she's trying to deal with (if she's wasn't dealing with them, I doubt she'd be so upfront). As far as how you handle it goes, I think this has more to do with her personal journey in life than her just comparing her body to yours (like in your example). I'd recommend just supporting her in it and asking her for ways you could do that (assuming you'd want to. If not, then it's more of a "whatevs" kind of deal).
How do you stop being a "Nice Guy"?	OP you say: >I've been a nice guy most of my life like always being there for a girl while she's having troubles or feeling down >I only did this because I thought something more would come out of doing so You're not a nice guy, you're not even a nice person. Every "nice guy" I've met generally has generally been the same. They're not interesting people, in particular they're lazy uninteresting people (the lazy part being perfectly relevant because they think being nice alone should get them a relationship). Think of it this way, remember the nerdy kid who got a cool toy as a kid and everyone suddenly wanted to be his friend? You're the latter type of person. **YOU. ARE. BEING. THE. JERK.**	Aah, the old nice guy trap. Well, the first thing is to be up front, not get into the habit of hoping you can win affection by being nice for a while. Being nice and treating someone with respect is something you should do anyway, not only to people you want to sleep with. On a more personal note, I used to be a bit like this when I was 16/17. The following things changed - - be more impulsive, don't overthink things. It's a cliché, but it's better to regret something you have done than an opportunity missed. - Never turn down an invitation or an opportunity. Get into the habit of saying "yes". - Get more interesting hobbies. If being "nice" is the best you can do, you're probably boring. Learn a musical instrument, take up a sport, create something.
The Charleston shooting is just another in a long line of mass shootings committed by young men. Is it possible to help our boys and prevent further violence?	Growth of feminism, meant destruction of the male role model. Bring back families and good parenting and this will take care of it self for the most part.	Stop plastering their faces and their life stories all over every media outlet and news network for weeks on end. Stop grabbing every damaged and downtrodden little boy that the world forgot to care about by the eyeballs and showing him that "this is how you become famous; this is how you make the world remember you exist." Hours after his capture every child in America knows what Dylan Roof ate for breakfast, but can anyone here remember the name of even one of the victims without looking it up?
Guys how often do you check social media accounts of the girls you're interested in?	> Guys how often do you check social media accounts of the girls you're interested in? I don't. I'm not into the creepy stalker vibe where someone tries to find out everything about a person, instead of actually asking them. The most I MAY do is a Google search, if I have reason to think they are into something sketchy.	I seem to be the outlier. I check regularly, either to see if I'm interested or just to get a buzz off of her prettieness. Does backfire... every once in a while I will like a new girl, and I will look at her photos so much that I talk myself out of it. Sometimes, the allure of being around someone special can't be duplicated online.
Men who have lived or live with a female SO, what were some unexpected things you learned about women from living with one?	Tears and promises are not something to take seriously. Egotistical bias is a thing: when she wants to go out and he doesn't, 'he's being boring'. Etc.	I have no idea how to fold the majority of my girlfriend's clothes. They're not like normal t shirts that are easily put away. They are like sequin strips of cloth with weird arms holes that are impossible to fold. Panties refuse to be folded properly and can only be scrunched and thrown in a drawer. Hair ties everywhere. She's always cold.
Can friends "just" cuddle?	I ain't trying to cuddle, I'm trying to fuck. The fuck would I waste my time with that shit if I don't get to bust my nut at the end.	Well, if you were in a committed relationship would you feel OK with your partner "just" cuddling with someone else? Personally I wouldn't.
Anyone else excited at the prospect of being a dad one day?	Just started working on trying for a kid this month. I could not be more excited. I did not meet my wife until my late 30s and was beginning to think it was never going to happen. But after years of rejection, and shitty dates, I met my wife. Then I had to wait 2 years for her to graduate school and now that I just turned 40 we are finally ready. I cant wait. I love my niece and nephew more than anything and cant wait to have kids of my own. I try to play it cool with my wife (so I don't stress her out) but at this point I think I want kids more than her. My secret hope is that she can get pregnant and have our kid before my father dies (terminal brain cancer) so he can at least get to meet my kid.	Definitely. Or rather, I did feel that way many years ago, hence my having two daughters now. And yeah, it's pretty awesome. It's not always fun, but it's always interesting, and my kids are pretty entertaining, along with being actual people now (at 9 and 11), so we can relate to each other, have long discussions, play videogames together, etc.
Men who've dated women that let themselves go during the relationship; how'd your relationship go, in that regard?	"Obviously it's her body and she can do whatever she wants with it" And it's your dick and you don't have to stick it in a hippo	I'm pretty sure that you are me, somehow posting from 10 years ago. SPOILER ALERT: It doesn't go well. You will eventually stop having sex with her and she will respond by sleeping with a guy with terrible tattoos who wears a wallet chain. After you break up, she will appear at your door one morning at like 7 am to cry about her dead rabbit. Try to act surprised.
Men who have a significant other that was "wild" back in her younger years; how is that working out now?	Do you want me to link divorce stats? You'll find your answer there. Here you might find white knights and unhappy people trying to spin their failed relationships. Edit: Was it a white knight or a strong empowered woman who chose to go through my comment history to downvote away? I don't think it's going to help your self-esteem. Edit edit: I'm loving all the excuses and denial. It's like a fat kid stuffing cake in his mouth accusing genetiks of making him fat, because the cake tastes too good to be bad for him. "I want to sleep around so it must be good for me!!"	My sister was a drug addict and alcoholic in her teens, hit rock bottom around age 18. Plenty of sleeping around at the time. Got clean, has been clean for the last 15 years since. Met her husband 10 years ago in Narcotics Anonymous. They have the most beautiful marriage and their relationship has been pretty flawless since day one. They are the most adorable couple and their kids are cute as hell. This is probably an outlier case to some extent. They both clearly grew up years before they met and they both were always fundamentally good people. Results not typical. My stepmom was a wild one who was fundamentally always irresponsible and self centered. Things went a lot worse in her marriage to my father, and her abuse problems were her demise.
Men of reddit, have you ever been overwhelmed by the possibility of getting the girl you are seeing pregnant, that you avoid having sex with her altogether?	If getting her pregnant would be as much of a disaster as you make it sound, then you probably shouldn't be seeing her.	I once was together with a girl who was so .... naive and god damn stupid when it came to protection, that I kinda stopped sleeping with her for a while. E.g. she frequently forgot to take her pill and once she decided not to take the morning after pill after she fucked up because she was on a ski trip and it is certainly okay to take it after 48 hours. I was so sick of the monthly nightmare that I broke up with her. However, we somehow got together again after a few weeks and we switched to another solution. So yeah, pregnancy was a threat to my life plans and options back in the days and it lead not only to abstinence but also to a breakup.
Have you ever had a girl insist on being "one of the guys" only to be repulsed when you treated her as as one?	I just don't like hanging out with girls. I'd rather watch you guys play Portal for three hours in silence than talk about keloid scars from c-sections and kid's bowel movements.	Repulsed no, been completely offended, cried and one of my friends gets told what a jerk he is because he gave her some shit, yes. Why would you want to hang out with us when half of our jokes are about how we're fat, stupid and going to end up alone forever? It's like the woman's greatest hits of things to make her cry.
How do I beat my boyfriend in wrestling?	Before I was on hormones, when me and my boyfriend would wrestle, I'd constantly move. Keep his hands separated so that he couldn't hold me. If he did get me in a hold I would use my fingers or toes /foot to tickle him since he was extremely ticklish. Once he let go I would get on top and hold him down. And that would be the end, usually I didn't beat him. XD For reference: He's: 6'2" 350 lbs I'm: 5'4" 200 lbs	I hesitate to say this but you should be aware that he's almost certainly holding back through fear of hurting you. This means that you shouldn't be looking for ways to hurt him as quite a few of these posts are suggesting, there's nothing worse than a woman who doesn't realise a playfight is a **PLAY** fight. Now, if you're not willing to cheat like that (and you shouldn't be) then you're basically screwed, he's almost certainly bigger, stronger, has more reach and there's a good chance he's even faster than you.
My gf has no hobbies and constantly want to be with me, have you had a similar problem?	DAE not understand why this is described as a "problem"? Maybe the two of you are just with the wrong type of person. Because I would have loved to have found at least one attractive, desirable woman in my life that constantly wanted to be with me. It seems to me that you just aren't as into her as she is into you. If you're really into someone, of course you want to spend as much time as possible with them. If you're not really into someone, that gets annoying.	Dumped her after she freaked out when I went to do things without her. Relationships like that are parasitic at best.
[NSFW] What are the best and worst one-night stands you've ever been had?	Met a girl at an Abercrombie party for employees. My cousin was the manager. 5mins after meeting and complementing her thing, we went in the bathroom and preceeded to get it on! Quickest one night stand ever. I hate that moment because 99.9% if the time it's not that easy. I also think it depends on where you are looking. I live in LA. The social game rules here are far different than anywhere else.	Best: PCB Spring Break 2007. I was a sophomore, I went with my frat, we were packed in like 10 guys per condo. Met a girl who had a family beach house there, and was staying with her friends. We fucked all the time, did a lot of drugs and had a fucking blast. MTV was there and blew the fucking roof of the place with some sick concerts/big acts. Worst: We both got nearly simultaneous diarrhea from eating some tainted icepops from some ice cream vendor cart. She only one bathroom so I used the toilet while she used the shower. This went on for what seemed like an hour until I could shower the filth off, roll home and spend the next few days mainlining gatorade and saltines.
What's the dirtiest things girls have done to you that you secretly loved?	I love golden showers with my girlfriend, so one day she decided to do a poo on my penis while she was riding me. It was more of diarrhea, and as I went to blow she splat all over me, and it was like a watergun fight. I really enjoyed it.	She said she had a surprise for me as she was on top riding me, then just before I came she hopped off, went down on me and sucked on the tip like a straw as I orgasmed. It was so intense and so long that I thought I was time traveling.
How can I communicate to my friend that I'm into him and want to get physical?	1. Approach him 2. Say "Hey, I want yo dick" 3. Proceed to sexy times It really is that simple if you own a vagina.	>how can I subtly feel out if he wants it as badly as I do? I don't want to be too obvious in case I weird him out Fuck not this again. Here is a nugget of wisdom from the FAQ: >Be blatant. Extremely, blindingly blatant. Guys, particularly younger and nerdier guys, can be terrible at picking up at signals that seem obvious to you. Anything short of "want to come over and bang right now" can and will be misinterpreted.
Anyone else hate how they look right after a haircut?	I always feel better after a hair cut. I have my hair short and when it grows it feels like shit.	No I am always amazed at just how much better it makes me look! I have very thick hair so it's needs taming I guess.
Gentleman, is your SO the "hottest" woman you've ever dated? If not, what is it about them that it just so much more of an attraction to you?	I would say both of my SOs are, in their own way. They're very different women, it's like comparing different flavors of ice cream.	I'm pretty binary when it comes to my SO's looks. Either a woman is good looking enough for me to date or she isn't. Once she falls into the "good enough" bin, I only care about their personality. I don't think a "super hot" woman would make me happier in the long run than a "normally attractive" woman. Having said all that, My SO's are generally not the hottest women I've dated.
What is the most disgusting thing you've witnessed a woman doing?	having a train ran on her (8 guys in about 2 hours) then went and kissed her boyfriend and slept with him..made me think all females are like that because this girl was "praised" on how innocent and good she "is" when all you hear is "oh shes this that this that" all positive, then you see her do something like that..makes you wonder, "hmm..every girl claims to be this this and that"	Before I was ready to come out of the closet I dated a girl so that I wouldn't turn 19 and still be a virgin. Apparently I was pretty good at going down on her. One time though I made her totally gush just from doing it and apparently she had some massive infection way up in there. To this day I don't eat guacamole because it has the exact same color, taste and consistency as the infected female ejaculate. I dry heaved for days.
What's the difference between the girl you fuck and the girl you date?	The girl who fucks outside of a relationship (aka has FWB or fuck buddies) is not the girl I want a relationship with.	1. Guys (the ones interested in casual sex in the first place) tend to have lower standards for casual sex than they do for relationships, so attractiveness is one reason a girl might only be considered as a casual sex partner and not as a romantic option. 2. It's possible to have plenty of sexual interest in a girl but not want to date her due to personal incompatibilities, or a lack of romantic attraction. Even if the people spend time together fine in the context of a friend(s-with-benefits-)ship, there can still be personal incompatibilities that make the guy not think that a long-term committed relationship would work. 2. Sometimes a guy is at a point in his life where he's not looking for a relationship. It's a common excuse, but sometimes it's true. 3. Many guys specifically aren't interested in turning a casual sex arrangement into a relationship.
Would it bother you if your girlfriend remained good friends with her ex of 5 years?	I'm best friends with an ex of mine. It would be hypocritical not to. I also think that having a problem with the dude is at least partly insecure. Then again, maybe she should use a different word than "love."	It's a problem in this case because he's still pining for her. If it was purely platonic I doubt I would have a problem, but would monitor a bit for warning signs.
Dudes, have you ever broken it off with a girl because you found out she had a promiscuous past? Why, Why not?	Yes. I was with a girl and things were going well, super compatible lots of getting to know each other. But she had mentioned she had been with around 50 guys, which was about 5 times my number but I didn't want to make it a dealbreaker. But when things got hot and heavy and I fingered her she felt... wrong. Beat up or scarred or just messed up down there. And I went from ready to go to shriveled in just a few seconds.	Mostly because she admitted that she regularly performed sexual favors on her friends on a dare and that they regularly tried to get her to go further and further by getting her liquored up and testing to see if they could get her drunker than she thought she was. And she went back to the area those people were from for the summer to visit her family and had no plans to avoid them or to refrain from going drinking with them despite our relationship, which I parsed as "I'm planning on cheating on you and then using having gotten drunk as an excuse."
What is the least selfish thing you have ever had done for you in a relationship? What is the most selfish thing you've ever experienced in a relationship?	Least selfish I have done: to help a girl in stuff which could give her more chance with her actual crush which happened not to be me. And I knew. Most selfish thing I have experienced: the girl I was dating lied to me not to lose my material support (rides, lunches, gifts) in spite that she had a quite formal relationship with other guy.	Most selfless: The last girl I dated cushioned my fall when I passed out in the bathroom taking a piss after coming home from a hernia repair surgery.
DAE have no social life on most days?	I talk to my dogs and cats a lot... like a lot. then I know it's time to call a friend up.	I really struggle to understand when you are supposed to initiate conversation with others or when they are with you. I feel so often I'm always the one sending the opening text or message on Facebook and that we chat for a short while and then that's it. I don't get the feeling they'd talk to me again if I didn't make the effort to talk to them. Often I've let friendships die because I've felt if they really wanted to hang out with me they'd talk to me and 100% of the time they never do. It can't always be me 100% of the time with the responsibility to initiate can it?
Men who are mostly attracted to 'cute' girls, what makes you like that type?	> But it sometimes feels degrading, almost like I'm being seen as a child instead of a woman. No need to feel this way. Men and women use the word 'cute' differently. When a woman says a guy is cute, 9 times out of 10 she means she doesn't want to fuck him. When a guy says a girl is cute, 10 times out of 10 he means he does want to fuck her. For women, the word 'cute' is a way to de-sexualize a guy. They associate 'cute' with kittens and babies and those kinds of things, so when they say a guy is cute, they mean they don't think of him in a sexual way. With men, this is not the case. When they say a girl is 'cute', this means they are attracted to her sexually.	''cute'' when men use it usually means pretty and approachable and somebody they want to cuddle up with and hold hands with. Nothing child like about it.
How do you feel about serial monogamists as opposed to people who have casual flings/sex?	> So, you'll often hear about a very high partner count being a turn-off You do often hear this, but not everyone feels this way. I think all this stuff you're talking about depends entirely on who is involved. Generally speaking, unless you're consistently making a string of terrible decisions, I won't judge your past. (none of the situations you describe sound that way) People get hung up on all kinds of stuff, and it's more the people than the stuff, if you know what I mean. I feel like if someone has a problem with serial monogamy, it says more about their past than yours. Everyone's life is complicated, and to make judgements without understanding the whole picture is foolish.	It's not so much the never-being-single and jumping-from-one-relationship-to-the-next. The thing about those kind of women that bothers me is they're able to do so because they surround themselves with male orbiters. In her circle of friends, maybe two thirds of her male friends want to date/fuck her. They're constantly flirty with her, and she expects her current boyfriend to just accept it because "that's how we've always been". It's a carefully cultivated climate of constant validation from always feeling desired. There's got to be some neuroses in that somewhere.
What stereotype about men do you conform to?	I like my long term partners to have less sexual partners than I do... like A lot less. Can't explain it but I know its not because I hate women but in my experience girls who have only had sex with like less than 10 guys are just more compatible with me. maybe its just a coincidence but i haven't met a "promiscuous" girl that i clicked with anyway. And I tell them my number and they don't seem to mind so I guess if everyone's happy right? Oh I'm also super into sports like an unhealthy amount of time is spent learning BS that Ill probably never need.	Work outdoors with my hands in a relative high risk job. Preferred beverages are beers or whiskey. Two modes of transportation are truck or motorcycle. Very solitary person and happy with it.
How do you sleep with your SO?	Sometimes with my dick inside her allll night. Usually just spooning with my arms around her and my hands on her tits	We share a queen bed and are both thin people, so we have quite a bit of space between us. Don't get me wrong, we both love a great cuddle when relaxing, but we both need our space when actually falling asleep.
Those who've dated "non-affectionate" girls, what was your experience like?	My ex started off as not very affectionate and it fucked with me for a while. She eventually got better at it but it did make me doubt things a lot for the first few months. Some people just aren't affectionate.	My SO is really not affectionate. She never touches me or hug me or shows physical signs of affection unless I do it. She usually responds to my affection in a positive way, but she remains a bit distant. The sex is absolutely not boring and lame though. Once it gets going, she is very passionate and into it. Showing affection and being into sex is two different things. I have to be dominant though. If I do nothing, nothing is going to happen. But, that doesn't mean she is a starfish. It's quite the opposite. She just goes with the flow.
What do guys feel about eating out a girl?	Absolutely love it. I love giving my partner pleasure. I love the taste, the smell, everything. I've done all kinds of crazy stupid shit in the name of eating pussy. I once ate my ex out for the entirety of a movie, one of the first times I did it, just do find out what I was doing. Got her off in the end, and whenever we saw that movie playing we'd laugh. I went down on my ex so much that when I pulled up after finishing, it looked like she was bleeding. Turns out it was me. I had been down there so long and had been going so nuts that I cut my tongue or lip open without noticing. And of course, I'm fairly certain every decent pussy-eater has come up with his tongue/lips kinda numb. Sign of a good job.	Oh my god it's my favorite thing. My favorite is when it nearly turns into a goddamn MMA fight before she climaxes. I had a girl wrap her legs around my head, squeeze and then try to push my head away. I grabbed her hips, held my breath, and finished the damn job.
(19 years old)- What basic tips could you give on how to act confident around girls?	There just as scared of you, if not more, as you are of them. Or maybe im getting them and spider monkeys confused again? My mistake. You should assert dominance by making yourself big, wave your arms around and make loud noises all while keeping eye contact. Now that I think of it. Im pretty sure thats what you do when your on fire... Hmm Best bet is to relax and play dead then. That always does the trick.	Start with this: Fail. Fail again. Keep failing until you succeed. Repeat. If you want to befriend them, it goes a long way to act like they're your oldest friend even though you just met. The quickest way to a new friend is to act like they're an old friend. Tease them, joke around, make an inside joke between you two.
What are your thoughts on slut shaming?	Slut shaming is just another way to be mad at men who don't want you in my opinion. When I was dating I made it known right away that I don't date whores. There's varying levels of what's normal in terms of promiscuity. A woman in her 30's who's had 20 partners is understandable where as a woman who just turned 21 having 20 partners is a slut. I don't think slug shaming really exists outside of someone Already having a vendetta against a specific woman.	Some people are downright hateful towards women who are promiscuous, or even just women who are perceived to be promiscuous, and I think it's fair to be critical of that. At the same time, it's pretty common to get accused of slut-shaming just for having a preference against dating promiscuous women, even if you don't express any particular hatred for them or shame them. I think this overuse of the word is wrong and it doesn't get talked about as much as it should on the discussions of slut-shaming.
What is an issue that you and your female friends will never see eye-to-eye on?	Marriage makes no sense for men. There is no reason for the modern male to ever marry. It tethers his future and freedom to a document that will NEVER end in his favor when things fall apart. Expansion on the above: modern women are not trustworthy.	The only one I can think of is female and male sex toys. One of my good friends won't even take male sex toys seriously. Then I get into an argument with her talking about how that's a double standard. So women can have dildos and that's fine but if men have a fleshlight, that's disgusting? We never talked about it again.
How does your SO initiate sex? How do you like it?	Reading this thread simply confirms my theory that I have a man's sex drive. When dating guys in the past, sometimes I see him walk by, grab him by the waist or arm, and tell him that we needed to fuck...NOW. Can't walk by me when he just gets out of the shower and is only wearing a towel, because I will pull that thing off and suck him dry. Bending over at any time? I will slap his ass and tell him how good looking he is. I guess part of this is because I'm a bigger, curvy lady who thoroughly enjoys sex and I want my partner to know that he makes me hot (and wet). I want him to know that I find him attractive and enjoy having sex with him.	only one of my girlfriends ever initiated sex. She would start groping me, take off my pants, grab my dick and "drag" me to the bed. Loved it. My girlfriends after that never did initiate. I've always had to be the one to initiate which sucks. I want to feel wanted too.
What's your go-to recipe to impress a girl?	Teriyaki chicken and rice or shrimp. Take the rice, chicken (or shrimp) and put it in a bowl, grab some kikomAn teriyaki liberally apply it to the mixture and mix it all together. Women love home cooked Chinese for some reason. My wife knows absolutely nothing about cooking so even just cooking a very rudimentary dish for her during our early dating days was a huge "oh my god I fucking love you" kind of reaction. I highly recommend that guys learn to cook to impress women because so few women know how to cook these days that it actually is impressive for a man to know how.	Risotto. Fancy sounding, not much harder than mac-and-cheese to make (unless you're going super fancy), not *too* time consuming, and slow enough to allow you to chat while it's cooking. Seriously, you don't want to do "omg, it's gonna burn- get outta the kitchen! Don't interrupt me!" stuff on a date.
Fit men of AskMen, is it important that your SO be fit too?	Not really. My wife was fit when we got together and is now pregnant. I still fuck her 4 times a day. When she delivers our son I will continue to fuck her as much as I can. Just because I make it a point to be fit doesn't necessarily mean I require my wife to be fit too. When she gives birth she will probably hit the gym and get back in shape.	Absolutely. I am not physically attracted to girls that are clearly overweight. Does she need a flat stomach? No, but a good body is a must because physical attraction is important to me. Working out is also just a way to show you care about yourself. I don't care how much you lift or how much cardio you do as long as you get there and do work. I don't want to be with someone who can't keep up with me in every day life because they are too out of shape. Plus I think the dedication is hot.
Girl I've been seeing can't have sex(Medical Reasons), what would you do?	It's kind of crappy she didn't bring up the issue before you guys started fooling around and possible feelings got involved.	I mean... You gotta do what you gotta do. That level of intimacy *is* important. Do you want to feel like a dick now or drag it out until your resentment makes you explode?
How does AskMen feel about girls flirting for personal gain?	It is manipulative but one of the harsh realities of life is that people manipulate each other. Say you are in a relationship and want to go out for a guys night but you know your girlfriend is going to be grumpy about it. So what do you do? You buy flowers, order out a nice dinner and clean the whole house. How is that any worse?	Even her bullshit reasoning doesn't hold up. More often than not, these guys realize after the fact that the woman was just using them to get what she wanted. Once they find out that they've been played, they feel like an idiot and their confidence is even lower than it was before.
What are easy mistakes girls can make to screw up a new relationship?	Blind siding a guy with a deep question like "where do you see this relationship going?" when you're doing something otherwise really casual like watching TV or something. (Edit: I should probably point out that this is absolutely not limited to women. Men should be careful about asking this question too - it's an important question and it's courteous to give your partner some advance notice that it's coming, regardless of genders.)	Refusing to tell me when things are bothering her. Look, I'm not stupid. I can tell when something has you pissed off or upset. If you don't talk to me about it, we can't hammer it out, and you're just going to stew on it and resent me for it. Then eventually, you're going to blow up on me over something very, very small, and unleash this explosion of molten crazy over all this shit you refused to talk to me about.
Fat guys who have little-to-no trouble dating: What are your tips for your chubby brethren?	Op Lose about 90 lbs minimum. The rest of you: just be in good shape x study psychology and sociology, people watch, learn a skill, go out A LOT, try new things, mediate, just stay out as long as you can.	Former fat guy. I think it's worth pointing out that being willing to go out with fat women will *drastically* increase your results, but I wasn't willing to do that, so I'm not sure how many other people here will.
Gents, what is your worst dating horror story?	I asked out a girl to go to the movies one day. She wasn't particularly pretty, nor is she very charming...a solid 4.5, or a 5 on a good day. But you know what, I was having a dry spell and was getting desperate. Anyway, I guess she just wasn't used to having guys asking her out...so she said to meet at the movie theatre. "Ok..." I thought to myself. When I got there, I gave her a call and she said to meet her in the theatre. When I finally found her, I also found her friend sitting next to her. Who the fuck brings a friend to a date? I watched the movie, because I've already paid for the ticket, and peaced outta there. Couldn't believe I put in the effort of putting on a big boy shirt with buttons and collar for that.	We were supposed to have a movie and pizza date at my place ( well my parents, I was 17) I drive to the plaza order the pizza and go to blockbuster to get a couple of movies. Get home about half an hour later and look at the answering machine. 27 messages. All from her. The first was " I thought we were getting together tonight, where are you" and degraded to " you fucking prick , I thought I loved you." This was to be our second date.
Have you ever found something out about someone you care about (friend, family, ex/current SO) that changed the way you view them? What happened? Were you able to "get over it" or get things back to normal?	Found out my dad was big into the PUA and men's rights communities. Still on good terms with him but I avoid talking to him about women/dating because he comes off as incredibly misogynistic.	Found out two friends were having an emotional affair with each other, behind their SO's backs. They ended up getting together officially while leaving behind the emotional wreckage of their previous relationships. There was a huge breakup. At first I thought "Well I'll just keep on being friends with everyone." But the combination of everyone shunning them, and me thinking about how shitty they are, slowly distanced them from most friends. I still say hi and make small talk if I see them, but that's about it.
When in a long term relationship/married does your sex drive lower or do you not enjoy having sex as much as you did before? If so Why?	yes. her vagina is like a new video game,... until I learn all the cheat codes. after that theres less challenge and therefore less satisfaction in defeating it.	It's typical for it to be higher in the beginning of the relationship when everything is new and shiny. Things slowed down a bit, but not a whole lot. I still love making sexy times with my lady. Here's the important thing to remember though - Sex is 10% of a good relationship, and 90% of a bad one.
What is it that makes the beard unpopular for politicians (and other groups)? Could a famous bearded role model change that?	If you're taking about those gross bushy beards that have become the latest fad, it's because they typically just don't look good. If you're talking about stubble, that might be because it can be seen as a sign of ageing or unkemptness, depending on how it grows in.	Blame it on The Greatest Generation. Upstanding role model community heroes and future leaders came home from the war all clean shaven. And that is when professionalism became associated with being clean shaven. They weren't allowed beards because their gas masks had to fit.
Who here has had a vasectomy?	I have a friend who had one because he never wanted kids. Anyway he was telling me about it (going from memory on timeline so I may be off some), and he said that it was supposed to be pretty well all healed up in about two weeks but he wasn't and it was taking quite a while to heal. Anyway after about the fourth week, he decided to try and give it a go by himself. He said that as he was blowing his load it felt like someone had hit him in the balls with a hammer.	I have. do it again in a heartbeat, Very little pain. Plus the wife agreed to help with the check ups after when they check to see how the little swimmers are doing (or not doing) ;)
Does any other guy dislike or find it annoying when there S/O is extremely active on social media?	Because women want attention and validation. These social media sites give them the power they never had before. Publishing photos of them hanging out with their friends, going on vacation, getting expensive gifts, make them seem fun and appealing. Hundreds of likes and compliments make them feel wanted and celebrity like. This is one of the major reasons that females are as entitled as they are today.	I like social media. Hell, you're using social media right now. That said, there's a point where it's excessive, but I feel like it's less "are you on Facebook?" and more "Why are you fucking with your phone instead of interacting with me?" I couldn't care less what my wife does in terms of using social media, as long as I never take a back seat to it.
Men who have never gotten into a fight: do you feel like you want to? How have you avoided being in such a situation?	I've just simply said "whatever this fight'd be about, you win". They walk outside with their shirt off going "YEAH! YEAH! I DA MAN" and everyone else recognizes who the grownup is. I also don't attend rap shows, Hells' Angels bars etc so I'm pretty good.	Living in America in a big city, I have no desire to get in a real fight. You just have no idea what people are carrying around these days. Any knife or gun and you may not come away alive. That said, I'm currently entertaining the idea of learning boxing and joining a boxing gym since sparring looks fun.
Got $19 left on my Amazon certificate, what's a must-have item for a college guy?	Alright dude, you have everything you need apparently so just save the credit until something occurs to you that you can't foresee. Or maybe use it to buy somebody a birthday or Christmas gift when you need to.	Decorations for your room - they make things way more comfortable. Especially as a girl, I liked seeing a man's room a bit decorated. I recommend getting curtain lights, small speakers, partially paying for a cheap projector (so you can watch movies on the wall with girls and not hover around a small TV or laptop). Even a little plant (chia pet) would be cool
Would you love your child more than your wife?	No. I already talked about this to my stable girlfriend - if we're ever going to have a kid, we will remain each other's top priority, otherwise I'm not having a kid.	Dad here. Sometimes one partner puts too much attention on the kid, and the SO doesn't get enough quality time. That doesn't mean one is loved more. But it might FEEL like it. Both need attention. If I have a problem with it, and I need more time with my wife, I'd talk to her about it. If she needs more time with me, then she should talk about it like any rational adult. One of our biggest things was my wife needed time with me and away from the baby. So we arranged baby sitters for that, usually they were relatives.
Girl said she wishes I was gay so we could be best friends, called me "adorable" and "cute". How do I make sure women don't see me as that guy?	Are you sexually assertive? Are you confident? Are you masculine? Don't be friends with girls just for the sake of being friends. Do you fuck them? Do they help you fuck other girls? Most of my female-relationships is based around helping each other out.	I don't have any pithy advice about your situation OP, but speaking as a gay guy, I and a fair amount of my brethren hate it when people pull that shit... that whole, weird, borderline fetishized 'Gay BFF' stereotype where some girl or group of them thinks that being gay means we're automatically down for going shopping with them, cruising guys at the mall, getting pedicures, going out clubbing every weekend and shit like that. FFS, I'm a dude who lives out in the country, works the land, has a small chainsaw collection, lives a fairly earthy lifestyle and dislikes patronizing behavior from people who think I'm automatically going to be their smarmy, catty, entertaining BFF just because I romantically prefer the gender group they aren't in. I daresay there's a fair amount of us who wouldn't even find them interesting. /rant
Got sucker punched by a girl. Can I press charges or is it too petty of a crime?	As a woman, I find that shirt pretty offensive (though I would probably find humor in it in the right setting). I do, however, find her behavior far more offensive. It's women like that that give feminism the stigma it has. That being said, I think you need to report it. People can't just go around punching people, life isn't a video game.	That would classify as assault, I think. Talk about it to the police, straight up punching someone isn't a petty thing, even if no harm was done. That said, I wanna know what the text on the shirt was.
(Question) I'm contemplating getting a vasectomy. But I don't ever get laid. Is it worth it?	I say do it. If you've gotten to this point in your life and still don't want kids then you never will. And you don't want a little drunken mistake to happen either. With pills, if they come out, if you miss a day, then you're potentially fucked. A vasectomy is how you know you won't have kids. Get it.	>I've been reading that the male birth control pill is soon to be released to the public Hehe, I will gladly bet you $300 that "soon" does absolutely not mean within the next 5 years. $150 that it does not even mean within the next 10 years.
How did you choose your major in college?	Looked through all the majors the school was offering and chose the one that made me go "yep that sounds easy"	Looked into which majors led to the best careers and which majors would be the best fit for me academically. I choose finance.
Men, I just found out I'm going to be a father. What's your best parenting advice?	For the first couple months, Mom needs a chance to recover and should be mostly bed-ridden. Most countries other than the US do this. Arrange for family to help as much as possible during this period, and much more than seems normal. I'm assuming you are from US. She'll be much better off for the rest of the first couple years and will be at much lower risk of PPD. Also, read to the kid every day, even in the womb.	Pay attention to all the baby tips you're about to get, but honestly the most important thing right now is nurturing your relationship with your wife. Keep each other as your #1s and stay a team. That alone can make or break those first few weeks, and those first few weeks WILL make or break the future.
Men who have been discriminated against, what happened?	My genitals were cut when I was a day old because I was born male. I've spent too much money on lube for masturbation. Trying to explain to my uncut son why mine is mangled causes him too much distrust for doctors.	High school counselor didn't want to let me take Calc BC because it "would be too hard for me". I'm Latino and I was super pissed she wouldn't let me sign up even though I met all the requirements. My high school was mostly white kids and hispanic (mostly mexican) kids. Ususally you only saw white kids in AP classes. After bugging her enough she finally let me sign up. Made sure to get high scores just to prove her wrong.
As a woman, how should I state my height preference when online dating without sounding like an ass?	If you're tall then you can say "only interested in men my height." Honestly why are you worried about being a dick because you have a preference? I got a lot of hate messages because my profile explicitly said "no fatties" but he only people who ever got pissed about that were...you guessed it, fatties. If the only group of people who is going to take offense to your preference are the type of people you don't want to date then fuck'em. That's their problem not yours. Don't be afraid of being a dick OP, short dudes are just mad at the world anyways so who cares.	As an extremely butthurt short guy, "I'd prefer someone at least my height" is ok. Sure, I'd curse God, world and mother nature if you were painfully beautiful, but I wouldn't mutter "Fuck you, bitch", like I probably would if you were shorter than me and put "no one under 6'0" in your profile.
How difficult is having sex for the first time as a guy?	Easy, but awkward. It's usually followed immediately by your second time, though, which is *amazing*. Don't worry too much about it. Have fun! Play with her tits and her butt; it's a blast.	Help him put his penis in. This sounds stupid and funny but a lot of guys actually have troubling *finding* the actual hole of the vagina their first few times. You don't realize how much extra space and skin there is until you are trying to put your dick in and it is pitch black and you are nervous as hell.
What do women do at your place that you cannot stand?	Open a bottle of wine to drink just one glass (or less). I don't drink wine by myself, but wine doesn't keep once opened so now I gotta flush a whole bottle of wine down the sink just because she wanted one glass. The worst part is every time I try to explain *"look I don't mind you drinking wine, but I feel bad about wasting a whole bottle if you only want one glass, so how about we just go to bed/have some water/etc?"* they always seem to turn it into a fight about me being difficult or not letting them just have a glass. So much wine wasted. So much! >_<	Well, it sounds like you're only there on weekends, which is good. A problem I had with an ex was she would come over quite often and just sit there, either expecting me to plan something exciting, or watch TV (which I personally hate doing for long periods of time.) But yeah, your SO might occasionally want some alone time for a portion of the weekend.
No more sex?	How about eating her pussy? You mentioned blow jobs in your OP but not reciprocal pleasuring. Maybe you weren't getting her off and she has opted out? Everybody gets tired, everybody gets stressed. It doesn't normally last for two years. Talk to her. Tell her that you feel neglected sexually and you want to either work it out or arrange to see a couples counselor. I'm wondering why you've let this go on for so long.	> a total of 5 times in two years This sounds like a nightmare. You might as well be single. Jesus. I'm feel bad I don't have advice. To be honest I would have *serious* problems if my wife didn't put out in a months time, let alone 5 in 2 years. I would have run already.
Would you rather have a trained T-Rex that you could saddle and ride everywhere or 100 million dollars?	$100 mil. I'd go bankrupt, or violate about a hundred laws, the first time I had to feed the t-Rex.	I'll take the hundred million. Properly invested, the annual return would constitute **fuck you money** for my current lifestyle. And I wouldn't have to sorry about shoveling dino shit into a truck.
Gents of Reddit, have you had either of your parents commit infidelities. If so, does it make you more determined to be faithful, or does the apple never rot far from the tree?	Unless it is habitual during early child development, cheating isn't going to have an effect on the likelihood of an adult cheating. Cheating occurs because one party in the relationship is not having their (usually emotional) needs met. It is a symptom of a relationship that is in trouble, not a symptom of something wrong with the cheater.	Dad ran out on my mom when he found out she was preggers with me. I'm Planning on being there for my wife and child till the very end.
What was that moment when you were like "aaaaand definitely going to break up with you"?	When she told me she didn't want me to become the president of my Unis gaming club because it would take too much of my time. Ignoring the fact it was my dream job and I had been wanting it for over a year and a half.	When she had quit her third job in 3 months because her boss was some version of out to get her. Girl, there is a pattern here and it's you. I can't pay your half of the rent for the next six months.
What was your most recent "I am not a smart man" moment?	My friend and I were unable to find a bunch of emails for the longest time. Turns out they'd ended up in the junk mail folder.	About to get into car. Notice scratch that wasn't there when I left it. Slightly raging. Follow scratches along the car to where they end, near the back lights. Rage intensifies. Ranting and swearing begins. Notice JD Sports bag in the back window of the car. Don't remember going to JD Sports. Don't remember my Peugeot having a VW badge. Turns out it isn't my car. See own car 2 spaces down. Such relief. Slink into it and drive away.
Have you ever been initially rejected by someone, and then gotten together at some later point? How did the relationship turn out?	That's actually how my current GF and I started out. She was dating someone long distance and the relationship was already not going well (BF was from a strict Asian family, she's white, etc.) and I would always be her 'date' whenever our mutual friends would go out. So eventually we developed feelings for each other and I just came out and said "I think we should be together." She initially turned me down, and later that week went to go visit her BF for the first time in months. It was supposed to be a week, she was back 2 days later at my place. We never looked back, and have been together for 3 years.	I was FWB with a girl for a while, I asked her to be my girlfriend twice and she said no both times. About a month later she started introducing me to people as her boyfriend, I just rolled with it.
Does anyone else have the problem of women not doing anything to try and carry on a conversation?	Most women don't have very good messaging skills, yes. I have better luck when I ask a question and then follow it up with statements.	No, I don't have a problem. They do, with me. If a woman can't hold a conversation, she won't have a conversation with me. That's her problem, not mine.
What is something you often hear women say they want in a man, but you think they wouldn't like if they actually got it?	A good man. The good guys end up timid, unskilled, inexperienced and respectful with a so-so job. The not so good have the skills and initiative and force of personality to get what they want, which is, laid, with a more high-status job. Or the hottie wife.	"Treat me the same as you do your guy friends." Begged me to stop the next day, didn't realize how much special treatment she was getting as a girlfriend.
Are Male Teachers Sexual Eunuchs?	Obviously exceptions are going to exist, all my male teachers were married growing up. However, it's definitely true there are professions that women see as sexy (doctor for example) and those they find generally unsexy (nurse as another example). I don't think it's a coincidence that the professions women find sexy tend to come with a lot of power and prestige. If that is what motivates you to do a career, I suggest you consider that when making a career choice, because again while it isn't an inherent deal breaker it won't make things easier on you.	Your friend is talking out her ass. Think about it, you're going into an industry where *there are more women than men* and you think that puts you at a disadvantage meeting women? How does that even slightly begin to make sense? I can't imagine a scenario where years later in your life you'd look back at that time you traded your dreams for a soul crushing job just because you thought it'd get you more pussy and then patted yourself on the back. That whole idea is crazy.
what are some of the best decisions you have made in your life?	I started lifting about a year ago. I used to be one of those girls who never wanted to pick up a weight but my friend finally convinced me to do it and I became addicted. I never knew how empowering it would be to be physically strong. I'm slowly getting my female friends to lift and they're enjoying it too (:	Seeing a therapist. Went from having disturbed sleep every night for half a year to no troubles. I no longer freeze in panic/anxiety in lots of situations. I learnt how to be more open with my wife and have a much better relationship for it Asking a doctor to help me and getting the referral was one of the best things I ever did.
Guys, what are some of the WORST decisions you've ever made in your life?	Going to a big state school my freshman year, instead of community college. I transferred somewhere cheaper after a year, but I'm still $26k deep 4 years later.	Getting a DUI. Easily the most fucking idiotic thing I have ever done in my life. The fine itself was only $1500, but that doesn't include the other costs (i.e. 15 weeks of alcohol classes at $25 a class, 2 years of a breathalyzer at $85 a month, a bunch of miscellaneous court fees, losing my car and needing to buy another one). Just the court/class fees alone cost me nearly $4000. The downstream/cascading costs were incalculable. Probably another $5000 on top of that at least. I learned my lesson though. No taxi will ever charge you $5000 for a ride, so it's always worth it to take a cab, even if it's 50 bucks.
Single men: do you find dating/being single fun or frustrating and depressing? How can I change my outlook?	Stop caring so much and you might have some fun. That's the key for me. The less I give a fuck about what some chick at a bar thinks of me, the more fun I have.	I hate being single. It's depressing. I find I will stay with people that are way wrong for me because I'd rather have someone than no-one. Currently alone and miserable....
Girlfriend of eight months hasn't done anything to recognize my birthday. It was two weeks ago. How would you feel? Is it alright for me to upset?	I mean if you wanted something, you should have set expectations. You didn't say anything, you just let it go by. If you don't set expectations or mention it beforehand, then you can't really be surprised when nothing happens. She still should have done something though. Like come on. But I would phrase it in the sense that you're upset instead of "YOU DIDN'T DO THIS STUFF THAT I DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT BUT EXPECTED NONETHELESS".	I mean, it's going to be awkward now that you waited so long. I can't imagine how this conversation will go. I'd just tell her I was bummed out we didn't do dinner or anything for my big day and see how she responds. Did you ever mention you don't like making birthdays a big deal?
Men of askmen, what are your cooking skills like?	I do 90% of the cooking. I went from trying to make stuff taste as good as possible (i.e. really unhealthy shit) to finally figuring out how to make healthy food. I have a few mind-blowing dishes that I keep in my pocket for special occasions, but usually it's just chicken, fish, or salads. Favorite thing (and surprisingly easy): osso buco. Pro-Tip: If you're not using sea salt in your salads, take a good hard look at your life and ask where it all went wrong	My wife has done most of the cooking the last few years, since she's been a student and SAHM, but now that she's working again, it'll likely end up about even. We're both pretty good cooks, but I think I'm generally better at seasoning and cooking meats, whereas she's got a good eye for combining flavors into a larger dish and making it all come together. Between the two of us, I think we're pretty damn good. Not sure my kids would agree, but kids don't know shit.
What are the top signs that a girl is insecure about herself?	If she says anything about her inner goddess or how she is a lioness. Always shares thoughtcatalog articles on Facebook	I can't give you a whole list, but a big one is: If she really, *really* wants people to know how little she cares about their opinion of her. Like, it's a top priority.
How can girls communicate why they're upset without making you feel guilty?	It's not really the same thing, but I get super annoyed when women make an observation about themselves like "I'm getting fat". Then as a guy you provide solutions. "Maybe you'd feel better by going to the gym", and somehow women turn that into "So you think I'm getting fat!!?" What? No. I'm just giving you solutions for your own insecurity.	I tend to hear SO's venting as if I should be fixing something. I know intellectually that's not true, but that is my emotional reaction. I work on it. Straightforward is still the best approach. If I get defensive, just remind me that you're sharing and venting, not blaming, not asking to fix. I need the reminder sometimes. I'm not perfect.
Young guys: what is a common statement/belief here that makes you think "yeah, you're definitely not part of my age demographic"?	Prejudice. Alot of older people where I live will judge the fuck out of you if you are anything but white. The problem is especially awful with Muslims.	The fact that we have posters who have never not had the internet at their beck and call. I'm from the generation who got it young, but I do remember a time before broadband.
What are the most confusing "signals" a girl has given you?	If I try talking to her in office, she ignores me. If I ignore her the next day, she explicitly shows her sadness. Okay, so I start talking with her again, and ....... These answers are probably going to help me too :-) :-(	A woman once stayed the night in my bed. She grabbed my thigh and started masturbating. Turns out she wasn't interested. That was ... awkward.
What's your laughably horrible worst date story?	We went to watch a movie at her place. I brought the DVD's: two she didn't like and one she had seen shortly before. That's one thing. She picked the one she's seen before. During the film we sat on opposite ends of the couch and we didn't really talk. Near the end of the film her parents came home, which was awkward as well. In the end it worked out though.	It wasn't going well, I tried to end it by saying "well, this was fun. You live that way, I live the other, I'll text you." I walked 5 blocks home, only to realize she followed me.
Men who now make a lot more money than they used to, did you notice any change in your relationships with women?	No change. We're both feminists, so I respect that she wants to be independent and contribute equally to expenditures. Small exceptions are made now and then, and I've convinced her to let me treat her to restaurants every now and then, because *I want to*. She and I have a healthy amount of respect for each other - she often compliments me on my entrepreneurial spirit/savvy, and I marvel at her logical brain all the time. She's often two or three levels deeper than I am on a lot of topics, and it always humbles me to see how much narrative there is in everyday life.	I went from making $8.55 an hour to $11.35 an hour so I can afford more gas and food and stuff.
Is taking a break in a relationship healthy? Would anyone recommend it?	Translated from girlspeak: "I am at the peak of my lifetime beauty and sexual value. I want to fuck lots of other guys. Bye."	Translation: I think I can do better than you. If not we'll get back together in the future because I couldn't find any other options.
I hear a lot about women who never have experienced an orgasm during sex. Are there any men out there with the same issue?	I think you just need the right girl and to feel relaxed. Find one who can have vaginal orgasms fairly easily. She'll be well lubrucated and the fact that she's very obviously getting hers will boost majorly your confidence.	Happened to me the first 4 or 5 times me and my ex had sex. Fun for a while because I could just go until she finished. Eventually the more comfortable I became with her and our sex life I started finishing consistently
I'm going back to college at 25, is it creepy to date regular undergrads?	Dude, I'm 34 and I've 'dated' two girls under 20 this year. Who gives a fuck? Especially in an atmosphere where those are the girls who are going to be around you all day. If you're not hurting anyone, do what you want and dont apologize for it.	I went back to college at 25.. I didn't DATE any of my classmates, but we did other neat things and it wasn't weird.
Do you feel like you have to appear as nonthreatening as possible?	I'm 173lbs, 5'10" and pure muscle. The only way I can be "unthreatening" is if I'm wearing a banana suit. Not doing that.	Yeah. I'm big. If you're an average sized woman I'm massive. Throw in the beard and real wide shoulders, if I'm a little bit messy I see people cross streets to avoid me. In my winter coat with a watch cap I look exactly like a batman henchman - just a generically large mean person who probably does crimes. So, I try to speak softly. I say "Oh goodness!" when I hear a story about an outlandish circumstance, smile a lot, and am especially polite. This appears to put people at ease and make them more comfortable around me. I consider it a courtesy, just broadcasting that I'm a sweet person not a mean one.
How can I get my girl friend to stop treating me like a girlfriend?	You're her emotional tampon. She's using you as a sponge so she can vent, but I'm willing to bet that she does absolutely nothing for you. Edit: Typo	Stop enabling it. If you don't want to be her source of comfort, then stop doing it every time she goes to you for it. Understand though, however you do this whether you just get colder or you tell her to stop doing this, this will probably cause rifts in your friendship. She's going to you because that's the kind of friend she sees you as. You're essentially telling her that that's not what you are, and she'll be understandably confused or upset about it because that is what you were telling her the kind of friend you were through your actions.
Askmen, what is your favorite sex position and why?	The whole idea of sex positions turns me off. Sometimes I fuck her from the front, sometimes from behind. But if your idea of spicing things up in bed is to put your foot behind my head, then you are terrible at sex.	Seated cross legged with her legs around my waist. Super intimate, you're right up against each other. She gets hers easily, and all I have to do to get mine is put my hands back, lean, and start thrusting away Edit: typo
Do you find a person more physical attractive the more you socially interact with that them?	Physically attractive? Nope. That is decided in the first 10 seconds or so of me seeing their face. It can be changed with diet, exercise, or different attire/makeup, however. That said, it is nice to see a girl or boy having a quick whit about them. A sense of humor or a well placed pun will make me respect them more.	Yes. I tend to see the positives of their body more and ignore the negatives. It helps when I can confirm that she doesn't mind talking to me vs. before when I had no idea if she'd be annoyed at my mere existence. This has happened to me with numerous girls at work.
Have you ever hit a girl out of self defense? If so, what was the outcome after the incident?	Unless she has a knife, blunt weapon, or gets a complete absolute sucker punch there are very few, if any, women out there that are any physical threat to me on my guard. I wouldn't hit a woman for the same reason I wouldn't hit a child, discrepancy of force.	Yes. A girl hit me in a head with a skateboard because I was fighting with her brother (he started it). So I hit her back.
What do you think about a 16-year-old guy dating a 23-year-old woman?	> What do you think about a 16-year-old guy dating a 23-year-old woman? First thought: "Niice, this dude is upgrading to mature women!" If the age of consent of the area the person is 16: legally, go ahead. This applies to girls as well.	I won't lie, it's pretty fucking strange for a girl that age to be with a teenager. I would feel pretty damn great if I were him, but it's still weird.
Guys, what's the biggest dick move you've ever pulled?	Okay so, there was this substitute math teacher and my best friend and I were pretty similar looking. So the thing was this teacher gave the classroom an exercise to do, and the one who could finish it in time would get a 10, my friend did it but not in time, and then, (looks like the teacher kept thinking about how a dick he was to him) at the end of the day, he asked me my name, saying that he was going to put me the then. And well, I gave him my name instead of my friend. Also my friend was close to fail the semester (but at the end he passed)	This guy my sister was dating pissed me off so I covered the hood of his car with maple syrup and bird seed. It was winter so it froze on there pretty good. There was SO much bird shit.
When it comes to dating/relationships, what was your "I just hit a one-in-a-million jackpot" moment?	When I was looking at porn this morning with a blonde and a redhead getting DP'd, and I realized that the feeling I was experiencing was nostalgia because she's in Florida for a week. We did that just a couple of weeks ago, and now the thing that was one of my fantasies is a happy memory of how hot my SO is. Makes me happy that I'm dating a smart, loving, beautiful, wildly sexy woman.	Made a profile on OKCupid. Messaged 1 girl, nothing. 2nd girl I messaged ended up becoming my wife. She was about to delete her profile and saw my message.
Do you have an ex you would go back to in a second if they asked you to?	I have an ex or two I'd bang again if they asked me to. And a couple that gained *way* too much weight where I'd laugh at the offer. But date? Nope. It's a breakup because it's broken.	In a second? Probably not. But one of my longest lasting relationships only ended because of distance. If that distance was resolved, I think I would happily date her again. Would she? Who knows? She's engaged to be married so it's moot.
Would you let a girl sleep with you in the same room even if you have a girlfriend?	I've shared a bed with a girl friend a couple of times. If everyone is an adult and everyone is okay with it, what's the big deal?	Definitely, because I want to be able to predict the opening line of every domestic argument for the next ten years.
Men that have bought male sex toys, has it changed your perspective on the real thing?	The best way is to imagine that since most women cannot get orgasm from penetration, every time we have penetration sex with you we know that its not that pleasurable for you and you can get far more pleasure from masturbation and vibrators. Compared to that, I don't think male sex toy is such a big deal for your insecurities. From women lack of pleasure from penetration ( but many of them still into it), you as a woman should have known better that sex is not all about physical sensation, but emotional connection too. Unless you think men don't experience those things like women.	I've got one. Girlfriend bought it for me, 5th anniversary. It's great fun, and feels lovely but the amount of effort that is put into using it isn't always what you want from a quick session. Lubing, Cleaning, drying. Unless you have a good amount of sexual privacy in your own home, it's hard to feel motivated to use it sometimes. It's amazing for reconditioning your penis to feel stimulated from friction if the normal act of masturbation (deep tissue massage) gives you death grip. Edit: and no, it won't replace you. Feels similar to a vagina. Not preferable.
On a scale of 1 to 10 (ten being best), how good of a catch are you? Why so?	7 you can't be overweight and be a 10 and I am about 20 over right now, but my GF is a 9 so maybe that makes me a 9.	Well a while ago some girl posted a picture of a guy who she believed was a 5, and I look kind of like that dude so I'm a 5. Average af
Potentially [NSFW] What has your partner said or done that has absolutely GOBSMACKED you?	What the fuck is "gobsmacked"? Actually today my girl and I were in the middle of a movie, and out of *nowhere* she blurts out "Do you think I'm ugly?" in a serious tone. The real issue is that this is becoming a pattern with her despite the fact I tell her every damn day she is beautiful to me.	I had a gf in college who..while giving me head stopped and said "i want to watch you take a shit". I didn't have one on deck for her at the time..and i was a bit put off.. Never did shit infront of her tho.
I just messaged my ex on facebook. What is the stupidest thing you have done lately?	First break up I spent 6 months crying over her. Second break up I realized I didn't want to do that. So the day we broke up I hit on some girls downtown and got laid that night. The following weeks I met a new girl each week, each more amazing than the last. Choose	I didn't delete my porn folder or search history whilst my computer was breaking but still usable. Now my friend is coming over to fix it and I'll have to spend the whole time looking over his shoulder.
Does women commenting on "dad bods" offend you?	I think the double standard about women being able to care about weight, but men being shamed if they do is horrible. But on the other hand, people who say "dadbod" are idiots, and I don't hang out with idiots.	We can go on a tangent about double social standards, hypocrite “feminists” ect… But to save ourselves some time I’ll just say this: It’s a good habit to not get offended by stupid people.
What's your more creative date ideas?	I honestly dont even know how to meet interesting women at my own age so I have no idea about proper dates either. 28 single, and at this rate I will die alone.	Last time I went on a first date with a girl, we went to the natural history museum of my city. It seemed like a good idea because there's plenty of things to look at (and to talk about) and since it's a museum, you can't talk out loud so you have to get close to each other. The date went really well and I plan to go back next time I have a date. Of course, it all depends on you both, some would find it really boring.
Would you play with a random child at a playground?	I can't wrap my head around the fact that your skin color changes anything to the issue. Edit: Can't help but think the downvotes are racist.	Black guy here! Most of my friends are parents, so I tend to have kids around me at some point, so I get to hang out with them a bunch. If a strange kid ever approaches me and asks to join in, I always find the parent and get permission after explaining what's going on. That way, no rules are broken and adults can rest at ease. What's even better is when I'm at a small, family-friendly festival and everyone just kinda let's their kids do whatever in typical hippie fashion. Then, I usually play for a while, then sit down and talk about life and existence and stuff. I never ignore children. They are the ones that will have issues in the future because of that shit, and I don't want to be the one who sends them over the edge.
When it comes to dating, what misconceptions do you find women have about being a single man?	If you're single, you must be an asshole who masturbates into his pants every night, then goes on 4chan to talk shit about women.	Apparently, if a guy expresses interest in someone, getting into her pants is the sole motivation for everything he's done around her, ever. Also, there's this misconception that any bit of affection will be taken sexually.
What's the most sexist thing that has happened to you?	Once a woman made fun of me for having a girl's bike (which wasn't even true). I thought of making fun of her for having a girl's body, but thought better of it.	Shortly after my 18th birthday, the United States government forced me to sign up to the selective service and put my name on a list to be drafted, else I faced jail time, fines, and other penalties. I was forced to sign up because I am male, females are exempt from signing up.
What are your least favorite AskMen threads?	Honestly, I subscribed to /r/askmen & /r/askwomen at the same time, and the difference is incredible. /r/askmen seems to be full of hostility, whereas /r/askwomen seems to be quite supportive. Both tend to have a lot of rants & complaints about relationships, etc, but the way the two subreddits *handle* the issues are so different. I'm male, and yet I find myself commenting on /r/askwomen much more often than /r/askmen.	The ones that go like this: I'm 16 and she's 14 and we had this huge fight and now I'm scared I might lose *The One*
Do you fight with your SO? Do you consider that unhealthy or normal?	Nope. I'm an adult and can express myself constructively rather than by being a jerk to my partner. I don't really understand the people who do fight. Longest relationship was 5 years or so and never fought like that. It does certainly seem to be normal to act like that, but as others have said, it certainly doesn't look productive from my perspective. Also, his entire mentality seems wrong, letting stress out and abusing my partner shouldn't be things that go together.	There is a very direct correlation between how hungry we are and how likely we are to fight. Usually we eat dinner and then realize that whatever we were bickering about isn't actually important.
What is the worst pickup line/method a girl tried to use on you?	Just saying "hey" or "hi" It's epidemic levels on dating websites/apps. Girls have no game, because they think they don't need it.	She had a friend ask me if I would date her, while she was standing right next to me. It was very uncomfortable.
Asian men of Reddit, how difficult is the dating scene?	Mixed here (Chinese/White). Would not consider myself near a 10/10, but never had an issue dating other than my personality. Confidence is king and judging by this post, that might be a bigger issue than appearance. I live in Orange County so there's a ton of asians. Lots of mixed couples. I'm sure there's some prejudice towards dating Asian men, but I don't think its all that debilitating.	30 year old Korean guy in the East coast. Unless you're very attractive, or unless you're very engrossed in the Korean community, it's VERY difficult. I see many half-Asians responding, and I think you actually benefit *more* in this respect. Foreign-enough to be exotic, but familiar-enough to be common.
Guys of AskMen, what is it about female promiscuity that bothers you, if it does?	I personally don't care at all, I mean I don't have any qualms about other guy's dicks having been, at some point in the past,inside a girl I like. I just don't care and I'm not naive about it, I'd even go as far as to say that it's good because that means she probably has good experience. However, such behavior is risky due to STDs so it does matter a deal. It's a case-by-case thing though, so I don't play by any general rule, and I would never turn down a girl on the sole basis of having a promiscuous past.	I'm with you if the guy actually *is* being hypocritical. My issue would be if the number was "off" with your partner. If one person has had 2 sexual partners and the other has had 52, I think that's a problem. It is indicative that the two people have differing views on sex and the meaning of sex. It isn't necessarily an insurmountable problem, but it is definitely an issue that is worthy of discussion.
How many of you prefer not to be friends with women?	I love having female friends. There's a light that turns on inside of me whenever I interact with attractive girls, I just sort of become more animated and charming. I like to be that way, so the more time I spend around women, the better. Plus, having more female friends dramatically increases your chances of getting laid because most girls have multiple lady friends :)	I was struggling to figure out how to say it, but the only way I can say it is I am friends with my friends. I have several women friends and several men friends. My dynamic is often different with my men friends, but that doesn't mean I value my women friends any less.
Guys who have hot ex(es), how do you actually feel about dating girls after that are an obvious "downgrade" in terms of looks?	My ex is a supermodel for a very famous clothing company. I've yet to see a woman as beautiful as her and we broke up a year ago. Although who she was as a person is not who I want to be with, I would be lying if I didn't compare who I date to that again. It's a difficult circumstance.	One of my best friends (a woman) has an ex who is preposterously good looking. When he was single, EVERY time I'd go out with him, whether it was a bar or a J. Crew, women (incredibly hot women, too) would approach him. She broke up with him but stayed friends and had a picture of him in her apartment. She started dating a guy who I was also friends with. We were all over at her apartment early on, and he saw the photo. He looked over at me and said, "Is this [insert his name]?" I said yes. His response? >Damn, I must be GREAT looking if she dated this guy. They're married now. His confidence about it was clearly a positive. Own it - he chose YOU.
Do you feel like most women are better looking when dressed?	In the southern USA, yes. There are so many fatties and so much loose skin and stretch marks on former fatties, and they look much better with clothes on.	I appreciate girls who put a lot of time I to their clothes and makeup, but I'll *always* opt for waking up next to someone without makeup or clothes.
What are some simple, relatively harmless actions or behaviors that fill you with rage?	Driving slow with a line behind you. Yeah, you might technically be doing the speed limit, but at the same time it's completely obvious that everyone behind you wants to go faster. They probably have places to be, shit to do. If you don't have any stuff to do, that's cool, but have some fucking courtesy - pull over, let people pass, and then continue on your slow-ass way. Stop holding up an entire group of people just because you don't personally feel like going faster. Also: driving in the left lane without passing. Knock that shit off.	* People who chew with their mouths open when they eat * People who blast music, phone calls or videos through their phone speakers in a public setting. Same with games. * People who get distracted on the phone (or distracted/space out in general) when you're talking to them, then go, "Huh?" and ask you to repeat yourself after you're finished talking. Pay attention, idiot! * People who don't let you through onto traffic/blocking traffic if you're trying to cut through or turning onto traffic. (If that makes sense.) Also, people who don't move over a lane on the highway when people are trying to merge.
Girl here: Standard of sleeping over after sex?	That kind of question pisses me off cause it reminds me that i'm a 22 years old sexually frustrated guy who's wasting his youth and who would like to have sex casually like OP does. Life sucks. Why is it so easy to be a girl?	I think it would be best to sleep over simply to be safe. I'm no native of New York, but any major city in the middle of the night is usually less than ideal to walk about in. From a social stand point, it really varies from guy to guy. And girl to girl really. Ask yourself what works best for you and go from there. If no one is asking you to leave, waiting until morning should be perfectly acceptable. You could even ask before going home with him. Possibly make it a jesting inquisition by asking if you'll be treated to breakfast or whatever approach you think best.
What was the weirdest situation where you've gotten laid?	I got laid after getting arrested, processed, and released for a DUI that same night. I got busted while dropping my girlfriend (at the time) and her friends off. The girl I had sex with wasn't my girlfriend.	I'm Indian and from Canada. I went to visit my cousin in the US. We ended up hanging with his friends (mostly white people). I start talking in an Indian accent. We then went to a bar and I told her beer relaxes the muscles in my tongue and gets rid of my accent. Everyone else laughed and realized I was faking but she thought it was real. My cousin then tells her the truth and she gets mad at me. I go to apologize and give her a hug. We start making out and she takes me back to her place. She wants to have sex with me while i doing the Indian accent. It's not a sexy accent...
When I drive a girl home after a good date, I drive just a little slower than normal to spend a little more time with her. What little things like this do you do on your dates?	This is the complete opposite of me. I want the date to be over with so I can go home and relax in my solitude.	I usually start a long conversation about 3/4ths of the way home that way we usually end up parked outside her home just talking.
Are braless women really that distracting?	No more than a girl with a bra on. My best bud's SO doesn't wear bras and they're a C size. I honestly have never noticed, nor has it inclined me to look any more than I have been to look at any other girl.	Guys are going to look at your boobs no matter what. And depending on a few factors, they might look a little longer if you're not wearing a bra. Don't overthink it though, and definitely don't feel shameful for doing what feel comfortable for you. If that means not wearing a bra, so be it. Any guy that does give you unwarrented amounts of attention is going to have done it bra or no bra.
How much are we really fooling you with our makeup/figure flattering clothes/push up bras etc?	Some people look way different without makeup. A little bit to enhance the facial features, eyelashes, eyes, etc is fine. But if you're a whole new person with makeup, that's false advertising. Push-up bras are straight up false advertising. No way around that one. Hiding a not flat stomach isn't false advertising, that's just showing off your better features while not necessarily showing your not-so-great features.	Most people tend to be more critical of their own imperfections than anyone else is, and as a result they try to hide them in the early part of a relationship. But if you get to the point that you feel enough of a connection to this person and you're willing to show them your imperfections, it's very likely that they're not going to mind them.
Men of reddit: Could you ever love someone with 60+ sexual partners in their past?	Gross. Honestly, no I wouldn't, and I'd be quite disgusted. Not sure if I'd even want to be friends with someone with that kind of history. Sorry, if that's not the answer you wanted to hear OP, but I figured since you asked here you'd much rather have an honest answer than a rosy answer. To be fair though, I'm sure there are many guys that would be okay with it so you do absolutely have a chance at love. Everyone has a chance at love. I'd say you should be honest about your past, cause honesty is the right path, and you shouldn't lie to someone you love.	I personally wouldn't, but obviously we don't share similar views on sex. Doesn't mean I'd hold it against you as a person, just means I most likely wouldn't be relationship-compatible. You just need to find someone who share similar views on sex or someone who is willing to accept your past.
Ever find out one of your best friends may be a wife beater? How did you handle it?	I stayed the fuck out of it, and so should you. You'll never know the truth, and that's what the law is for. If he keeps trying to argue you onto his side, say "Dude, I always thought the way you guys fought was unhealthy and childish. I have no idea if you beat her up or not, and I'll never know for sure. My advice is to get out of the relationship, take a long, hard look at how you allowed such an unhealthy relationship dynamic to develop, and don't do that again in the future."	God no. What kind of person thinks it's normal for people to break dishes or flip over furniture or *wrestle* when they have an argument?
Your girlfriend is attempting to seduce you, what is she doing to achieve that?	When my wife wants to have sex, we wears fewer/no clothes or tells me she's horny. Attached women don't have to be seductive. They just have to be available. Seduction is move for women trying to move in on a taken guy by being hotter/more sexually available than the lady he's taken by.	I find that pushing me down into a sitting position, sitting in my lap facing me with my hands put on her hips, and then proceeding to kiss me before kissing down my neck while she starts to take off her top and my shirt is a strong opener.
Girlfriend wants me to wear a t-shirt that says "If you insult my girlfriend, my fist will be the last thing you see". What is the stupidest thing your SO has asked you to do?	I'd have no problem fighting a guy who insults my girlfriend given he's being an asshole and his complaint is way off base. I would have a problem wearing a retarded tshirt that basically says "I'm my girlfriend's bitch".	I used to date a girl that got off on seeing her boyfriends get in fights. She'd start them. I didn't date her for long.
Aside from blowjobs, what small everyday thing can a significant other do to make a man not feel taken for granted?	I don't mean to be funny here and I applaud you for trying, seriously, but if you have to ask what to do and then do it because you feel you have to it doesn't really count.	Just be active in the relationship. So many girls think its okay for the guy to do all the planning, buy her things, do this and that and she can just be sitting pretty. It's not about gifts, or anything like that. It's about the thought and gestures. Be equal in your love and you'll be good.
Men of reddit, how was YOUR college experience?	I have had the unfortunate experience of going to 3 different colleges throughout the years. And while I have had those typical college experiences (partying, clubbing, sex, adventures, ect.) overall I have had more boring days than exciting days. Not everyone is guaranteed to have a good time in college, you get what you put into it, and every college is different. But my more exciting times in college were in my freshmen and sophomore year where I had more free time.	I went to school in the middle of a big city, so the dating life was *highly* competitive. Most men did not get laid. That said, yes, I made some of the best friends of my life, learned some incredible stuff in and out of the class, partied, did drugs, prepared for my future, and all of the above. What year are you? I know I had a bit of an adjustment period during my freshman year. Just leave yourself open to new experiences, and don't be afraid to say yes. Good things will come to you.
Men of Reddit, have you ever been physically abused by a significant other? How did you cope with your emotions afterwards?	She used to smack me around and hit playfully and I mean shed hurt me but I was a guy and had to take it.	I was abused on and off mentally and physically by my ex-wife. She would go nuts and hit me in the face for the most stupid things. I had young children and didn't leave the marriage because of it. I could never understand why she would snap like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. She would make me believe that it was my fault when she acted violent. Then finally one day I had enough and I divorced her. I am much happier now and don't live in fear of the crazy woman anymore.
Women of AskMen, has browsing this sub changed any of your views?	Yeah, I really liked being friends with men but I didn't realize just how much vitriol there was towards the female gender. Now I'm much more hesitant about these things.	Yes. Well maybe not changed views but it's nice to learn some things. Even if they are sad things, like how scared men are of being nice or chatty with an unknown child, even if it's at a playground, for fear of being seen as a predator. I'm sorry that happens.
Men of Reddit, what is your best move in bed?	Depends on the gal and what she likes. Fisting is fun. Varying between long strokes and short strokes is typically another good one. Getting them to squirt. The Hitachi. Dom/sub play. The possibilities are endless.	I have a good fingering technique down. Slowly massage the vag, then rub the clitoris ever so gently. Proceed to stick a single finger in the vagina. continue adding your fingers until your whole fist is in. slide your arm slowly into her, once you reach your shoulder limbo in with your head, and forcibly insert your other arm, torso, and legs. You are now free to control her. When you feel the job is done, finish by giving birth to yourself. Found this on yahoo answers years ago
What do you think the hardest thing about being a woman would be?	Since most women never initiate, they have a lot of power in the dating market. Unfortunately, this means they also have the task of doing a *lot* of rejecting. I hate giving people bad news. I'd hate telling a bunch of guys "no, you're not good enough for me" over and over again.	Everything about pregnancy. Much of your sex is in fear of it and then when you want to get pregnant you have to be miserable for months and then deliver a bowling ball as the reward. Good times
On the flip side: What do you guys like to see in a woman's dating profile?	I actually kinda like it if she's a mother. There's something very vulnerable and nurturing about a woman caring for a child. It doesn't exactly eliminate "crazy" from the list of possibilities but it makes me feel like she's more grounded. Gives me that wholesome vibe.	*Message hooks.* If I'm going to spend the time to actually read your profile before sending you a message, you have to give me something to message you about. They could be anything. A funny anecdote. A cheesy joke. A charming detail. But whatever they are, a good profile has these interesting little tidbits that provide the subject matter for someone who is messaging you.
Guys, What is something that your S.O. Does that makes you smile?	When she really wants something she does this cute little baby talk, and does a little dance when I agree to her request. Gets me every time :3	I go to sleep later then she does. 9/10 times she will be knocked out cold but as soon as I get into bed she rolls over and wraps around me. love it everytime.
Men of reddit, what is something you've been discouraged from doing because you're male?	Raping women. Thank god I was taught what it was and discouraged from doing it, otherwise I'd probably be raping women right now /s	Take care of my son as much as his mother. That includes finishing work early to go get him after daycare, missing work when he is sick or be the one who is notified by the daycare center when something goes wrong. People always expect the mother to do those things.
What do you think of women who enter the men's restroom because the line for the women's restroom is too long?	It's largely "meh". The double standard is mildly annoying, as is the idea that they're making the l*ines in the mens room* longer by their actions. But neither of those things is really enough to get all bent out of shape about. And let's be honest: this almost exclusively happens at bars, concerts or sporting events where people are drinking alcohol. And If I'm there with a girl, I want her to come back to the table/seat faster so we can have more fun, right? So whatever works.	Call me crazy, but I'm against it. I don't personally have a problem with a woman in the men's restroom, but it's unfair to those who may be uncomfortable with it. People deserve to be able to use the restroom in public comfortably (relatively speaking).
I just got a raise at work, and I'm going on a date tonight. What's going good in your life?	Got the entry level job that will lead into what I actually want to do in life. Bit of a pay hit from what I was doing. But, like I said, It's where I want to go.	My puppy hasn't pooped in his kennel overnight in more than a week, I got married to an amazing woman on Monday, and my job just put me (and only me) in charge of our new 3D printer.
In a few hours, i'll probably be ending my relationship with my girlfriend. Scared as hell, but i've gotta talk to her. Any advice?	Start with "It's over!" *long pause as the message sinks in* Take it from there. Be honest, don't spare her feelings. But don't lie to 'make a stronger case' or anything. Be prepared to take some 'punches'. But if she starts screaming or worse, just leave.	Probably no amount of words or advice will make the anxiety go away. Personally, I'd take a shot of some nice bourbon a half hour before, take a deep breath, and just rip the band-aid off. This is probably terrible advise, but there's not much else you can do.
I just went on a shitty date, what's the worst date you've been on guys?	She was probably really nervous. Being overweight and "weird" it might have also given her a confidence boost to finally get a date. Men can be pretty cruel and have such high standards. Don't be bland. Don't be too weird. Don't talk too little. Don't talk too much. Voice your concerns. Don't complain. Be yourself. Shut up, already. Weight doesn't matter. Why are you fatter than your pic? Anyway, she sounded weird and annoying, regardkess. But you also seem a bit shallow since you are only looking for fwb and won't outright say it.	Went on a date with a girl I had been acquainted with through a bar I frequented on Fridays. We met for drinks and hung out, then some of her friends showed up randomly... She says its just coincidence, and they seem cool so we all start hanging out. She proceeds to get wasted, and starts a bar fight with some dudebro. Have to physically restrain her and get her out before the cops show up. Didn't go on another date, and reamed her out the next day. She stopped coming by the bar... I think she was embarrassed.
Guys who ended up getting your dream girl, how did it turn out?	Married after two years, 7 year old kid together, we were extremely happy with each other and in love, at least I thought so. Then we got divorced and her and my daughter moved to another state with her new boyfriend. I realized the whole institution of marriage in the 21st century is stupid for guys. Most of them end up hurt, broke, and alone. I definitely made the best out of a bad situation, but still wish I would have never gotten married.	please dont put your 7 years of expectations on to her, you'll only ruin things. Just keep being you and don't worry about your status with her. I repeat, all you need to do is not ruin it! I say this because I lost my dream girl by trying to "lock it down" instead of just being the guy she was attracted to. There is no such thing as a love contract.
What happens at university/college, in terms of eeting women?	Heres what I did and it worked amazingly well. Before you start college, get in real good shape. You don't need to have massive muscles, but it should be real obvious you work out. Having low body fat is slightly more important, but you need both. that's all you need to do. If it works out for you as well as it did for me women will approach you and it requires zero effort. Also I did a lot of drugs back then cause I hated my life. But women thought it made me look badass, which, while untrue, seemed to help a bit. Anyway, good luck! Now go hit the gym	Not sure what its like in the UK, but here in Germany we don't eat women at university. Or at least I'm not getting invited.
What is something annoying/frustrating that women do without realizing it?	Pretending to be 'uncertain' about a situation and therefore seeking advice, while it is patently obvious that their only goal is to tell everyone what total asshole or bitch this third person is, and that everyone had better start agreeing with her. The most infuriating part is that it doesn't even matter if everyone knows this third person, like a colleague or something. They'll gladly reveal any personal bits of information shared in confidence if it gets others to agree with them. Gossiping is basically convincing others that a common acquaintance is a bad person. And they wonder why men look down on women...	Often my girlfriend will ask me to retrieve something or get her something while we're both sitting or she is closer to the thing she wants than I am. I mean, i love her and i'm happy to help her out, but it gets kind of ridiculous when i'm in the middle of something and she's not doing anything at all, yet she's still asking me to go get her a glass of water.
Men of reddit, have you ever had a girl look at your dick while talking to you?	Yes. It just makes me think to myself, "you women are ducking hypocrites. I wonder if she wants to bang?"	I assume it's involuntary. I'd hate to be called out for all the times I was staring off into the abyss and the abyss just happened to be the tits of the woman I was talking to at the time.
Would you call a girl if she left her phone on the bill?	"Hey, we click. Would you like to go out sometime?" Guys need to be hit over the head with a frying pan.	I think the easiest way would be to ask him, "I don't want you to feel awkward but would you like to get a drink sometime when you aren't working" Direct communication tends to work well with guys. #notallmen
Just dumped my girlfriend for insulting me to another guy. Am I stupid?	She was drunk... People make mistakes. 2 years of your life wasted because you're overreacting on a mistake. At least hear her out.	You should provide some context for why she yelled at you and stormed out of the bar. For all we know, you could've been flirting with another girl at the bar and she caught you..
What is the most obvious flirting you've been entirely oblivious to?	This thread pops up every now and then and my answer is the same. I don't miss any obvious flirting. Though I'm sure it happens frequently that I miss flirting that the girl thought was obvious. Saying she should come over to watch a movie is *not* obvious flirting, nor is it flirting at all in my book. If you want me, learn to flirt properly.	A girl was telling me she should come over to watch a particular movie. I said: "Nah, it's an action movie, you probably won't like it."
What is something you desire sexually but you feel like your partner wouldn't?	She tie me down in the kitchen table and have her way with me while beating me all over with jumper cables	I can't find it, but somewhere there is a little test that asks you all these kinks, and you answer "would like to try, don't want to try, indifferent, or willing if partner is", and you both do the test without seeing answers, then at the end it only shows your answers that are the same, so there isnt the awkward "how do you feel about rape role play?". Never would have guessed my girlfriend would be into it. Edit: wow this is my top comment now! Thanks guys! Keep it kinky!
Do you keep getting dumped after few dates? ever figured the reasons?	See, I have the opposite problem. I just want to go on a few dates, and its like as soon as we have sex these girls want to move in. To answer your question though, my advice is don't act like shes doing you a favor to be out with you. You have to play the game a little and appear slightly un attainable for a little bit, otherwise she filters you out because she subconsciously convinces herself shes out of your league.	Nothing goes wrong. You are competing with a lot of guys. What are the chances that you are the best fit over all of them? Pretty low. And you arent getting dumped if you were never in a relationship, so stop looking at it that way.
What can I tell a guy to make him feel all warm and fuzzy?	Acutally just text him that: "I want to send this guy I'm dating a text that'll put a smile on his face and make him feel all warm and fuzzy." He'll melt like butter, I guarantee.	Text him that he makes you feel warm and fuzzy. Then 30 seconds later follow up with "and wet. Warm, fuzzy and wet." That should do it.
Guys who work in offices, how do you deal with it?	I don't participate in politics. I act like a little bitch boy and always agree with the most powerful people. It's worked out well so far	* Get up at the last possible minute * Sit in traffic * Stumble in 5 to 10 minutes late * Get coffee * Check email, backup server status, Reddit, and Fantasy Football team * Get more coffee, maybe stop and talk to someone * Go back to office and put feet up (not joking) * Think about what I need to do that day. If nothing then Reddit * If something then do it then Reddit * Check my stocks * Hammer out as much of any given project I'm working on until my brain stops working for the day or I accomplish that days goals or come to a good stopping point. * Fuck around * Gym
Men who are drifting apart from your circle of friends, for whatever reason, how do you cope?	I'm drifting apart from the remaining core of my teenage friends (am now 31). Drifting apart because I am married and have a good career, and they sit on their asses gaming and smoking weed. I'm coping just fine.	I do a lot of shit with my grillfiend and family. It doesn't bother me, but then I've always been more introverted anyway and always felt I had to sort of force it a bit. Probably a bit different when you're older. I don't get invited to parties or big social events any more, but I'm sort of past that stage anyway.
What's something you secretly judge women on?	I find short hair universally less attractive than long hair, so I judge a girl who gets really short hair although I don't have any animosity towards her or anything. If she wants to do it, do it. Also fat girls who hit on me. I can respect it if an ugly girl hits on me because she didn't choose to be ugly. But I'm in very good shape and fat girls don't have a chance.	When they're clearly deliberately playing down their own intelligence or opinions in order to seem cute or avoid conflict. It makes me feel like I'm having a conversation with a badly-written fictional character. I understand trying not to rock the conversational boat too much, but a clearly artificial personality, especially one that infantilises yourself, makes you seem desperate for approval.
How important is your partner's intelligence/maturity?	Education level or specific type of intelligence doesn't matter much to me, but an absolute requirement for me is a lively curious mind. I'm a couple standard deviations to the right of the mean, and it's extremely important to me that my partner be fairly intelligent. Realistically, I think there would be a fundamental incompatibility in a relationship with a person of below-average intelligence. For maturity, it's important for me to be with someone who is comfortable in their own skin and able to communicate and take responsibility for their actions. This isn't always a function of age, unfortunately.	Maturity is important to me, but it depends on how you define maturity. Some women seem to think doing anything that a child might do is immature, but I just call that fun. I want a woman who can be mature about the important stuff, like using proper communication instead of mind games, but can still have fun playing video games or just generally goofing off.
Men, what is the dumbest thing you did that you couldn't even tell your significant other in fear of relentlessly being made fun of for?	I'm in the process of doing one of the dumbest things ever right now. It's actually a long string of small things for someone. There is no SO to tell, and if this really isn't as stupid as I think it is, then she'll know regardless of if I tell her. If it is stupid, well, I don't expect to have an SO to tell anyways.	I once got so drunk that I ran away from my friends, and didn't show up again until 8am next day. It was in an unknown city, 3 days before new year's. I woke up sleeping under the stairs of the INSIDE of some house, with some lady asking me to please wake up and leave her house as she poked me with a broom handle. I got up, apologised, asked her to please call me a cab, and got out. But I've told several people this story because it's just funny now. I'm rather certain I have no secrets. Specially none that I'm ashamed of so much as to not own up to it and realise it happened and it was a learning experience.
To men who are on the smaller side, how do you maintain your sexual confidence?	Most girls don't care that much, why should I? I guess once I started just being friends with girls that I wasn't sexually interested in I learned just to be more comfortable around all women.	I am so god damn good with my tongue. It don't matter how tiny a guy is if she has come 4 times before pee-wee gets tagged in
How did you meet the girl you're dating and how did it start off?	I was born with her and I loved her ever since. It's the most loyal right hand you'll ever see.	We both worked at the same movie theater, but at different times. I had a party, and one of my friends brought her with. She started coming over all the time (we had a lot of parties). She was just a great friend. I started offering my bed for her to sleep in so she wouldn't drive home drunk, completely platonic. That went on for about a month, and then it gradually turned into a relationship. That was 9 years ago, we've been married for 6 1/2. We're getting divorced, but we have 2 awesome kids to show for it. Edit: Thanks for all of the kind things everyone has said. Didn't think this comment would get much attention at all, but the positive re-enforcement has been helpful. This community can be really great some times.
What are some gifts that you have bought for your female family members or your SO that have been a big hit?	Hello... female here. Get us stuff to pamper us that we wouldn't buy. I like gifts of nice soaps, scented lotion and extravagant bath oils. And I only get these things when someone else buys them for me, because I either don't get around to the stores that sell them, or convince myself to spend the money elsewhere.	I like giving items in theme. So if I give a movie, maybe some snacks and a blanket too. Perhaps a book, book light and bookmark or slippers. Maybe a water bottle, pony tail holders, and new ear buds. Consider a classic mug, favorite drink, snack combo. If they have any hobbies, see once if you can find a high end magazine on the topic, maybe at a local bookstore (My personal favorites on art journaling and jewelry as well as other crafting topics are made by a company called Somerset Studio). If you have any favorite or meaningful photos, consider putting a few minutes into designing a magnet, mug, frame, photo book.
I'm at work and the guy in the toilet stall next to me is watching porn. What's the most inappropriate thing that you've seen or heard at work?	Lol I jerk off at the work bathroom. But the sound is off and I never make a noise, and I only do it when the bathroom is empty.	I was training a new co-worker. And she kept "falling asleep" in the middle of me talking to her. I automatically knew what was up, but I just didn't say anything. Hours later near the end of our shift she went to the bathroom and didn't come out for a *long* time. So naturally, I went to check on her. Knocked on the door and no reply so I opened. I was genuinely worried. Well, there she was, pants down and passed the fuck out on the floor with her needle kit on the windowsill next to the toilet. She had OD'd on heroin. Had to call an ambulance. She survived thank god, but that was the last I ever saw of her.
Cliche event: Guy at party unknowingly kisses dude's girlfriend, why does the boyfriend get mad at the guy, but not the girlfriend?	Surprised to hear no one mention sexism here. I'm not one to cry "sexism" at the drop of the hat, but isn't this a clear example of assigning the man agency and control as the decision maker?	Probably because people would rather blame the guy in that situation was at fault than to believe that their gf would cheat on them.
What are some appalling recipes I can make for a soulless thief who is stealing food from a communal fridge?	You should confront this person instead of becoming a vengeance-crazed, passive aggressive maniac. If you continue down the current path you'll be keying cars that park poorly before you know it.	If you make cookies, you can make a colored icing that is guaranteed to dye their mouth blue. Basically mix confectioners sugar with water and blue food coloring, as much food coloring as possible. It'll stain the hands, clothing, and mouths of whoever consumes them. Found this out by accident while making TARDIS cookies for a friend's birthday party
Is anyone else kind of just... lost?	Join the military. Seriously. Just a couple of years. You get a whole other perspective on life. Sure, it can be dangerous but at least you'll have buddies and a mission.	Do you know what you want? Why compare your life to your married friend's if you don't want to be having a kid right now? You're not in a terrible place at 25. You're fit, sociable (as you can be), you're probably doing better than you think. I know you've said you've looked for a new job in the city, but maybe you can find one elsewhere? If it's the schedule or demands of this job that you think are the problem, see if you can find a more stable/consistent one where you are now. Outside of that, try to stop comparing. Life isn't a competition unless you want it to be. You can be happy for your friends while being in a different place. Take things at your own speed - besides, it's not like everyone who's married at your age has everything figured out either.
(x-post from r/AskWomen) When you first met your SO, were you instantly attracted to them, or did it just develop over time? How do relationships normally happen?	I noticed they were easy on the eyes from the get-go, but I've only seen a woman and thought "I must have her," in cases where it didn't work out, so, y'know. Usually I crystallize on wanting to date a woman after I've gotten to know her a little bit. For me, "normal" is knowing a woman as an acquaintance for a few weeks or months and then deciding that she seems cool and asking her out and her apparently having been eye-fucking me since we met or thereabouts. Or getting asked out by her.	Bam. Like a live wire. Halloween at college, eye on a girl, gave up when she was clearly after another guy, sat down with the big group at a movie and found this cute brunette sitting next to me. Put my arm around her (unusual for me) and she cuddled right up. Asked her out that week, great time on the date, leaned across the car for a good night kiss and it was like parts of my brain I'd never used before lit up. Engaged by Valentine's Day, married inside the year. Just celebrated our 34th anniversary. The wattage hasn't dimmed one bit.
Men of Reddit, if you could choose, how would you prefer a girl you are friends with to approach coming out of the "friendzone"?	She has to broach the subject first. First rule of friend-zone is the man never *escapes* from it, he is *released* by the warden. He doesn't get to decide whether to be in the friendzone or not. His only decision is yes/no if the woman decides so be something more.	for the girl to be blunt and honest, it's the best way in my opinion, when people bounce around the subject it's easy to get confused so it's just a lot easier to be blunt and straight to the point.
Is there anyone here who would say they are NOT ambitious?	Female here! I looked at the thread and a few comments, and based on a cursory glance, I don't think you lack ambition. Sure, you don't really want to move up the corporate ladder, but you've already secured a white collar job with a comfortable salary. When the women on the other thread talk about "lacking ambition", they seem to be talking about guys who work part-time on minimum wage, who are content to deliver pizza and smoke pot all day. Yes, you go to work and play video games and whatever, but I think what separates you and those guys is the job you already occupy.	Yeah, I'm pretty much the same way. Fortunately, I also lack any ambition towards relationships, so it doesn't matter to me if other people find me boring.
How do you get over a breakup that hasn't happened yet?	I tried feverishly to fix every problem before things hit critical mass all while in absolute denial of what was coming around the corner. On some level I knew it was coming though, and while I'm not proud of it started planting the seeds for something potential in the future with a couple girls in my classes/greater social circle (especially this one girl who was in one of my film classes... we started sitting next to each other during screenings and getting dinner together after). Truth is, though, I didn't get over it, until my ex finally did what had to be done, didn't let me plead and beg, and ended it like she was removing a band-aid. It took actually having an defined end for me to be able to start moving on.	Sorry man, this stuff hurts whether you're 17 or 37. But unfortunately a lot of people use "breaks" because they're too chicken to have the talk and give a reason and be compassionate. I hate to say it but things are already over. She was fucking ice cold and heartless to handle things the way she did but I guess the truth is she's 17 too. So I guess to get around your question... It *is* over. Accept it and move on. If she comes crawling back, you can think about it then. But she won't have an honest conversation with you about it and she's tweeting about how happy she is? Fuck that noise.
How do you make a date not feel or sound like a job interview?	I really don't understand how this is an issue to some people. You just chat to the person, if there is chemistry, the conversation flows and won't feel like an interview	Take her to a monster truck rally or something fun and exciting. That's what Aziz says. People too often pick the most boring shit to do on dates and you should really try to do something fun rather than sit there and eat dinner or sit there and drink coffee. That's why it feels like an interview because you're doing some boring stuff.
What could a woman tell you she wants to do that would blow your mind?	I honestly can't think of anything that would blow my mind with the fact that a woman wanted to sleep with me. It's really not quite ***that*** surprising. Maybe just hearing that a certain woman wanted to shtup me might blow my mind, but it'd have to be in fairly specific and unique contexts.	I had a lady whisper in my ear once ''Use me. Make me cry.''. Maybe not the most out ther or adventurous thing ever said but my mind was pretty well blown.
Men of Reddit, do you think babies are cute?	Babies are creepy little demi-humans. If they weren't needed for the perpetuation of our species I'd say to throw them all in a mass grave.	Newborns? No. Nine to fifteen months? Love them. They're the best kinds of people. They don't judge. They don't ask questions. They don't talk. They laugh at all of your stupid gimmicks and quips. And if they cry, you can narrow it down to three basic needs- I'm hungry, I'm tired, I pooped.
Does anyone find themselves more often dating a "You'll do" rather than a "Fuck yeah"?	I've never dated a "you'll do" because I wouldn't date them in the first place. I'm not desperate to date anyone.	I have the opposite problem. I find myself frequently pursuing fuck yeahs exclusively and as a result am often dating no one
Would you sleep with a girl you aren't attracted to?	I would wait till you find THAT girl. My boyfriend was a virgin when we got a relationship ( he was 23 years old), I ( 19 back then) did not care. I personally think you're giving something away that has to be to a special someone, but maybe that's just me. Please think about it though. I gave my PIV-virginity ( I only had one girlfriend before) to a guy who was NOT worth it and it kills me he was my first. But again: I'm sensitive and maybe its just me. Just think about it! And have fun :) Love, Dawn	In my previous non-married life, I avoided sex with people I worked with. Never worth the piles of bullshit. Other than that, go for it.
What's the best part about having a daughter?	Figuring out how you're going to scare the shit out of all of her boyfriends. My favorite one is cleaning your guns and telling them "I'd do anything for my daughter. Anything."	One of the best things for me is knowing that I have to be the male model in their lives. It keeps me honest and working hard to be the best man/dad/husband I can be.
Fathers of daughters: Did you warn your daughter's bf(or gf?) the first time you met them about anything?	If I have a daughter I'm just going to put on an act because it is fun as hell. Im like 6'3 and large so it'll be fun as shit to show off all my guns and how I would use them on someone who hurt my daughter. Then you have to invite them over when she isn't there with a cigar and a drink on the rocks and explain how it was fun to fuck with their head. It is like, American tradition. And if the dude gets scared and doesn't come back then oh well. I'm not that scary. Damn yall are all about feelings and shit. PCaskmen	Not a father, but I'm really hoping this is one of those dumb tropes that basically never exists in real life (like the sitcom dad who is an imbecile with a room temp IQ but somehow manages to own a home and support a family entirely on his one income). Your daughter will have her heart broken, have good relationships, make bad decisions, have rigorous sex, perform oral... You know, all the things a son would do. Its called experiencing life.
Men of reddit, what is something you never thought would happen to you...until it did?	I'm going to say being broken into also. Fortunately and unfortunately, everybody was home sleeping. My 9 year old sister had nightmares for a few months afterwards.	I never thought I'd get depression or have suicidal thoughts. On a more positive side: receiving free review copies of games from Nintendo before release.
Men of Reddit, are blue balls a real thing?	They're real in the sense that it's slightly uncomfortable, but usually when I hear about them it's in the context of someone being nagged & guilted into sex, so I'm kinda jaded about it.	I'm only piling on, because dear god they hurt. Yes, it's a real problem. It's like having a headache in your nuts.
Your S.O. likes muscular men but doesn't want you to be muscular. What are your thoughts on this?	Some women find big dicks aesthetically pleasing but date guys with average or even below average dicks and it's simply that they find pleasing to look at and nothing more. She could also have zero self confidence and you were way lower on the dating totem than she liked and doesn't want you to get out of her league if you bulk up. If she starts making you feel guilty about getting fit you'll figure out pretty quick which one it is.	How would she react if it was the other way around? "No honey I like your belly-blubber, don't change. Wauw look at her, man she's fit, I just love fit women. What? No don't change honey, you don't need to be fit.." Seriously if you want to get in shape then do it, she's probably just trying not to hurt your feeling by saying you don't *need* to change. I'm pretty sure that if you get fit, she won't complain. Edit: typo
Guys, when did you tell the truth but live to regret it?	My manager gave everyone in our team little knick-knacks for christmas that her grandma made by hand. Some knitted, decorative something. I don't care for anything non-functional, so I promptly threw mine into the trash 3 minutes later. It came out, but seemed like no big deal, then I received a "performance improvement plan" out of the blue like a week later, which had ridiculous numbers in it. Coupled with my manager's subjective evaluation (imagine the praise), this led to me being fired. Yeah, fuck that woman.	Back in college a buddy and I told our friend (the three of us were roommates) that his girlfriend was cheating on him. We went back and forth quite a bit on whether or not to tell him, but in the end we both decided we would want to be told. After we broke the news he thanked us for tell him, but from that point forward there was always some sort of rift between us. Within 6 months he moved out and neither of us have spoke to him in years (even though we've both tried several times). We found out through some other friends that he is marrying her. :/ Poor guy. We just want our friend back
"All my guy friends constantly bust each others balls. It's a sign of affection. The more a guy likes you as a friend, the more comfortable he is to give you a hard time. Guys are excessively formal and polite around guys they don't trust." Do you feel like this is in any way true?	I am not okay with that and I don't want friends who try to "bust my balls" all the time. I want supportive friends who don't use my misfortune or mistake as some subject of entertainment. My friends don't banter by putting each other down, often we banter by waxing poetic about how mind blowingly awesome the other is. Or we just hijack some minor absurd statement and see how far we can exaggerate it out of reality. There's all sorts of banter that isn't at someone's expense. I do not understand why insulting each other is considered normal in friendships. It's not for me and if you don't like it either then just know that you're not alone.	Assuming we are not talking about a work environment (as many people want to keep a work environment professional regardless), yes. The difference between friendly banter and disrespect once there is a relationship established, is the choice of what buttons that are pushed. Friends don't pick on the things that actually upset you, unsettle you, or make you look bad in front of others, and if they accidentally do they apologize for it. Friends pick on the things that you can make fun of in a lighthearted way. My breakup isn't very funny or appropriate to bring up in front of others. The time I borrowed a bicycle, didn't realize the rear brake wasn't connected, braked hard at the bottom of the hill and went right over the handlebars, is funny to harass me about. Especially if we're biking and there's a hill coming up.
As I've gotten older, I found myself turned off by full on pussy shots that 21 year old me would've loved. What has changed for you since you've gotten older that you used to like and now can't stomach it?	Music. Not that I cant stomach it, I just honestly dont give a shit. I have music I used to listen to that I like, but when I have free time I usually engage in intellectual pursuits like reading something or listening to some podcast on an interesting subject. Anymore I only listen to music when I run or when I'm at a bar.	Things young men often like, but I don't any more: cheap booze, validation from my friends, packaged junk food, sweet soda pop (I can still take dryer sodas, like ginger ale). Things that I still haven't outgrown at 46 and probably won't ever: fatty and salty foods, video games, fascination with boobs.
Hey reddit, I'm going through something called a "quarter-life crisis". I don't want to waste anymore time crying or feeling horrible, and I want to change. For those who've reinvented themselves in their mid 20's, what advice would you give to someone feeling overwhelmed?	Eat well sleep well exercise. Focus on that first. The rest will follow if you can get those basics right.	I'll tell you what worked for me - * More of: hobbies, exercise, experiences with people and places outside my comfort zone, dates with women who didn't check all of my boxes but were a little fun for a night or two, liking myself for myself. * and less of: material possessions (and the bills that come with them), hanging people who contribute nothing to my life out of habit, trying to be someone I'm not, comparing my progress in life to that of other people, watching television.
Girlfriend has depression; should this be a red flag? Can we still live a happy and good life?	It's not a red flag if she's treating it herself. If I were giving her advice I would tell her to dump you based on this post. Not to be a dick, but you seem to lack in emotional intelligence and you won't be able to give her what she needs if you're still this dependent on your parents.	Female here, dating depressed male. I could give you oodles of examples on why it is worth trying, but my main advice is this: there is no "happy ever after" with anyone, in the sense of everything going smoothly, rosy skies, birds singing to wake you up. Every person you will meet, will have some kind of issue/bagage. You have found someone who is not only aware of her issue, but is working on it. In my opinion, if you want to make it work, it will work.
Guys in college/university majoring in any humanities degree, is the pc/safe space/trigger warning/censorship culture really as bad as shown on the media? Can you provide a reasonable argument in its favour that you buy?	It is utter crap. Free speech 100%. Always, forever. You don't like what I say, go die in a fucking fire before you curtail my speech. If WW II were to break out today, we'd all be speaking German in 6 months with the legions of pussy-men we have running around this country. Christ.	Modern history/cognitive science major here. Wrote my thesis on social trauma in Northern Ireland. When everything you read is about car bombings and people being executed in front of their family, trigger warnings become a massive hindrance and thus aren't used. Edit: typo
Any of you in your 20's or up and don't have a drivers license if so why and how's it affecting you?	20 here. I tell people it's because I like speeding and I'd rather solve the problem at the source than control myself. I also don't trust people on the street, I hate red lights and a car brings a lot of problems (parking places, red lights, other assholes driving, etc). True reason is, I've never had the money to pay for the driving lessons nor the time for it. My dream is to drive a motorcycle.	20 YO, no license. I'm from NYC, so I never really felt the need to drive. Sure, it'll cut my travel time, but the train works just fine for now. And I don't have to worry about parking.
Can you tell me about your best friend?	Day 1 of college, this nerdy fella came up and asked if I like to drink. 7 years later, we have nothing in common but our love of alcohol. He's the best man in my wedding.	He lived in the dorm room next door to me freshman year. We were very different people. I was a nerdy fat kid studying engineering and he was running track at our school and studying Political science. I went to prom alone, he was the prom king. However I stuck around (initially probably because all the ladies liked him) and he was never a dick to me. He didn't make me the butt of jokes and over time we became friends. That was 11 years ago, earlier this year he got married and I was his best man. Really good dude.
"Once a Cheater, Always a Cheater"... Talking to a girl who cheated before. Thoughts on this philosophy?	Nah, most humans cheat, or at least *would* cheat if they weren't scared of the consequences (so they pretty much actually cheat in their minds, just not in practice). I would totally be ok with that, we're all fallible, and its human to err.	You think being a rebound and her cheating are a confidence or self image issue? I'd think the rebound is more a coping with a breakup thing and cheating more an avoiding confrontation decision.
Men, What was the "last straw" in your past relationship for you?	She didn't get along with my family, and my family didn't think she was right for me. Whether you get along with your family or not, they know you better than anyone else and, generally, want what is best for you.	My ex-wife, 5 years ago, driving while intoxicated with my son in the car. She nearly got both of them killed. I gave her a choice between her family or the drugs and alcohol. She chose the latter. I kicked her out, filed for divorce, got full custody of my son, and haven't seen or heard from her since. Moved on and currently engaged to an amazing woman. Edit: Spelling
How long does it normally take you to orgasm from oral?	The reason so many guys can't orgasm from oral is that their circumcised and missing the majority of erogenous tissue. It's rarely a problem from uncircumcised guys. Circumcised men don't have have the stimulation in the frenulum and ridged band.	It depends entirely on how long my wife wants me to take. If she wants me off quickly, she knows what to do. If she wants to keep me twitching until she's ready, she'll do that too. Damn, she's good.
Who's the theoretical guy you're competing against in the dating world?	I'm not going to even bother with someone who is considering multiple people. If they go on a date with you and then decide to date someone else, your chance is done. It's over with.	I'm in a committed relationship right now. However, when I was dating, I felt like the other guys had all of my strengths, but none of my weaknesses, and they can speak three languages, and have amazing abs, their back never hurts, and they always know what to do.
I told a girl that if a guy sleeps with her and never talks to her again its not because you slept with him its because he didn't like you and only wanted to sleep with you. Was I being too harsh?	I'm not sure you gave her great advice. Sure, it's great for thirsty guys to have more uninhibited girls out there. And for a few years, the guys and the girls have fun. But a huge fraction of men (myself included) will have less desire for a long term relationship with a woman who has a history full of putting out easily for other guys. Men just don't face that social consequence (for the same behavior) to a comparable degree. Fair or not, if a woman prioritizes an LTR later in life, being wary of one night stands is a good adaptation.	So imagine you're into this girl, you get along great, you have sex, awesome. Why would you not see her again? The answer is that he didn't think they got along as well as she thought they did.
Girlfriend revealed that she's "not very sexually attracted" to me. But now she's super-sexual and affectionate, almost like she's feeling guilty. How should I respond?	> I considered breaking up with her but she begged me not to do it because "you're the best boyfriend I've ever been with, I love your mind and your personality and I'm okay with not being sexually fulfilled as long as you are fulfilled. Sexual excitement is just not very important to me anymore". <---- in her words. That's emotional blackmail, and you should dump her.	I wouldn't be able to get over this. Saying 'Well, I was more attracted to my ex boyfriends, sexually, but you're such a *good boyfriend*' would make me feel like a fucking loser. Some things are better left unsaid. What guy doesn't want to be sexually attractive to their girlfriend and WANTED by her?
The Older I Get, The More My Dad Knows... What Advice Did You Ignore?	im not even gonna read all this.... my dad thinks he has it all figured out and hates me at the moment.... we havent talked in 6 months. I am an artist and he doesnt like it. bottom line is - DO NOT TAKE ADVICE FROM PEOPLE IF YOU DON NOT WANT THEIR LIFE! They only know how to get where they are... most people are bitter bc they didnt chase dreams or do what they wanted... or had kids.... or took a shitty job bc of "good pay and benefits"... 75-80% of people waste their lives and don't realize it til they are about to die! chase happiness - chase the burn inside.... chase passion. Fuck advice. chase feelings!	Awesome post. God damn, I learned just about every lesson the hard way, like my father before me. Haha, that mother fucker tried so hard to teach me the lessons he learned the hard way but I let it go in one ear and out the other. The biggest piece of advice I didn't listen to was when he told me "Don't worry about women. You focus on your goals and when you get older they'll worry about you."
Is it a red flag knowing that your current SO has been known to typically dates douche bags?	I would dump her, but I'm an asshole. Don't listen to me. Listen to other people. ... I'm not sure why I'm even posting this	Yes, but not for the reasons you expect. I've got an adage here, it's never been wrong. "If she calls all of her exes crazy, abusive, or douchebags, be prepared to be called a crazy abusive douchebag after you break up." It is *exceedingly* rare for one side of a relationship to be the sole cause of an issue. Anyone that plays the victim in all of theirs is probably using it to avoid their share of the blame. The guy version of this is "all of my exes are psychotic bitches". Well, yeah, when you keep cheating on them that tends to happen.
What dealbreakers or ideal traits do you want in a girlfriend that most of reddit would call you dumb for having?	My list of dealbreakers include: Drug/cigarette use. Tattoos of any kind. (They look trashy as hell on women.) Swearing. (A swear-word or two occasionally is tolerable, but I'd prefer none at all. I've been with my current SO for 2.5 years and I have never heard her swear, so it is possible.) Piercings in places that are not the ears, nose, tongue and mouth. (Seriously, WTF is up with nipple piercings? And those stupid eyebrow ones are even worse.) So go ahead, reddit. Explain why I'm an idiot.	Dealbreaker: No passion for something that isn't material or just a total fantasy. I need *some* ambition, I like to see people always improving themselves. Ideal: I actually like shy and clingy, as long as they're within reason.
Have you ever kicked yourself for missing out on a sexual opportunity only to realize as you got older that you actually dodged a bullet?	I don't kick myself for my past, however as I have gotten older I have begun giving fewer and fewer shits about sex or my sexual history. As long as I'm getting off regularly enough that I'm not fiending, I'm good. I'm more concerned with other aspects of my life than the sex I am (or am not) having.	Fuck no. The more crazy fucked up sex you have, the more you can look back fondly on it while you're jackin it in the handicap shitter at work.
When looking for someone who is wife material opposed to just girlfriend material, what stands out?	Good donestic skills and a sefless attitude about doing them. Cooking and cleaning and all that stuff. Id only marry someone who took care of all that stuff for me so that i could spend more time on my career.	I definitely differentiate. Generally, I look for things like maternal instincts, not being hectic, and matching kinks. A solid career and life choices are good bonuses here too. Sure the polyamorous stripper who's travelling to Asia soon is awesome, but the girl who's working steady and getting her nursing degree done? I can deal with things like wildly different and crazy for a girlfriend, but it's not wife material. Also, I'm sure I'll hit a point in the next couple years where I'm pretty much needing the girlfriend to have wife potential. I'm already looking at things like young partying girls as fads, and while it looks exciting, I kind of just want someone who knows how to cook and cuddle, and maybe wants to have my kids someday.
[Serious] A girl physically assaults you (slap, punch, kick, etc). What are you supposed to do that doesn't land you in cuffs?	I have been in this situation. I knocked her out cold. I punched her once. A real haymaker in the side of her head. Police were never involved. What the fuck would she do? I had 30 witnesses and she had been harassing all of them. Bitch had it coming. Edit: If it was a man i would kick him when he went down too. I don't believe in an eye for an eye. I believe in if you touch me i will beat you to a fucking pulp.	Relavant. I sat on a jury for a case where a young man was charged with assault and false imprisonment for holding his screaming and punching girlfriend's fists shut when they were in a hotel elevator. Witnesses in the lobby were alarmed as they saw a shit storm of domestic violence, called 911 and the cops arrested the young man. This couple needed to walk away from each other but neither had the maturity to do so. As a jury, we decided there was insufficient evidence and found the defendant not guilty. Still, it took a year for a court date to open up while this poor couple burned through money processing legal fees. Walking away or calling security supports your case that you were being assaulted. Self defense from a man on a woman is easily misinterpreted as assault.
Late bloomers, what surprised you about whats involved in relationships?	That you learn the horrible truth that sex with someone you care about is best but sex is still too good and relationships when young take too much out of you to want one but no sex sucks in comparison.	How at times you feel it's a meat market. I've never had a lot of friends, so hence I haven't had a lot of women hit on me. When my social circle expanded I got a ton of women showing interest. Also your relationship doesn't seem to have a lot of privacy from her friends. Which was hard for a mostly private person like me.
What about your appearance is "fake"?	Nothing whatsoever. To use one of your examples - I happen to be wearing combat boots every day at the moment. However, that has nothing to do with the extra height - I'm 6'2" and don't need it - instead having everything to do with it being cold and wet. I like having dry feet. I put stuff in my hair to make it manageable? Does that count? My hair isn't naturally this stand-uppy.	I have absolutely no chin. Like at all. Just mouth to neck basically. Full on Bob's Burgers style. To combat this problem I grew a beard as soon as I could and shave it to appear as though there is a chin under it. Works surprisingly well.
As someone who is not interested in casual sex at all, how do I avoid going on dates with guys who just want casual sex?	Sex is an important part of a relationship, not something naughty and dirty that only souless degenerates engage in. I'm a relationship-minded person, but I wouldn't continue to date somebody who I didn't sleep with on the first or second date. To answer your question, you can't, really. Saying "I prefer to wait until we're a couple" is coming on a bit too strong, and uncomfortably old fashioned, but your choices boil down to that or risk wasting your time.	If you don't want to participate in the hookup culture, if a guy asks you out you need to tell him you would like to meet up for a lunch date or meet up at a coffee shop for dessert and coffee during the day. Then communicate with him. You don't have to say you aren't interested in casual sex, but it is fairly easy to let someone know that you are relationship minded so then he has the opportunity to ask you on a more "formal" date if you seem compatible.
I often read on AM, "Don't take advice from girls about girls" Do you think the same is accurate about boys?	In heterosexual dating, women don't see all the required homework men have to do in advance, likewise, men don't see the homework women have to do in advance. So maybe, the best advice about dating men would be gay men, since they are both sides of the picture in a single person.	I often say, men should never take dating advice from women, only take it from men who are successful with women. I believe the exact same thing is true from women. Only take advice from women who are successful with men.
What is the sweetest thing a SO has said to you?	"Ya know, you are my guardian angel, I just feel so free and a burden is off my chest". "I want to live forever and ever and ever with you babe". Inside joke-"you are my panda bear and I can hug you forever". "We just have the most insane connection ever". "After everything we went through its clear we were destined to be together". She's my ex, bitch... :/	"If I were ever going to shoot you, it'd just be in the leg." Brings a tear to my eye even today.
Do you wish you had more hugs in your life?	I'm not a touchy person and I get really awkward when saying bye to people and don't know if I'm supposed to go in for the hug or not. When they're from people I'm close to though, I love them. I was really upset the other day and my boyfriend gave me a huge hug, and it made everything feel that much better.	We had a welsh dude at our work for a while, if you were in a bad mood you got a hug. Like a proper hug. I miss that guy.
If it were socially acceptable for men to wear makeup, would you start wearing it?	Fuck yes. I have seriously dark rings under my eyes even though I've triedn everything to combat it. I'd say I'm pretty young and I dont have any addictions/physical issues, yet I tried more sleep, less cafeïne, less alcohol, more exercise, drinking more water, more / less sun, etc. Nothing works. Other people in my family have it as well, yet all less apparent, and my sister can mask it with foundation. It's definitely something I'd change if I could.	It's hard to say. "If things were different would you do things differently?" Probably yes but I can't easily imagine it.
I'm a former fattie female and despite lots of exercise, my body looks very bad. How do you gentleman suggest I go about dating?	At the risk of giving cliché and potentially eye-rolling advice, I'd say *just keep trying.* Maybe go out on more dates, having more direct and intimate discussions about your body insecurities, and what you're looking for, early on? (All at being said not knowing what you're currently doing.) And I'd second the recommendation of saving up for surgery as a gift to yourself for your hard work. What the hell is money worth if we don't utilize it for our own happiness? You already sound like you have great confidence in who you are. There's no reason to deprive yourself of feeling good about your body, too. Edit typos	The best way to meet the most compatible partner is meet as many men as you can. Online dating is the best way to do that. The dating game is rough. You're going to have to wade through a lot of incompatible people like everyone else.
Stealing this from AskWomen; What are the 5 best, and 5 worst things about dating you?	Best: 1. I'm fairly good looking and workout. 2. I rarely get mad and have a cool head almost at all times. 3. I like to think I'm funny and sarcastic. If you can banter you have my immediate attention. 4. I'm fairly open sexually though I do have a strict no outside parties or pegging rule. Otherwise game on. 5. I'm adventurous and a natural extrovert. Worst: 1. I can breakup with you fairly easily if certain issues or problems arise. 2. I can be stubborn. 3. If you play games I will play games back and mine I can assure you are better than yours. 4. I'm a bit of a sarcastic asshole. 5. I'm fairly blunt.	Best: I'm very cuddly. I can cook and enjoy doing it for someone else. I'm not bad at the whole sex thing. I'm laid back. I'm not going to cheat on you. Worst: I work stupid hours. I drink too much sometimes. I'm not exactly rich. I get distracted by dogs. I fall, fast.
Guys who enjoy being single: Do you get lonely? What do you like best about being single? What do you dislike the most about it?	What I like most about being single is that I only have to live up to my own expectations and I never do anything I don´t want to do. I look at males I know and the things they do with their girlfriends and I would hate to have to do them. A) Going out to dinner B) Going to the cinema C) Going shopping with her D) Spending time with her family E) Having to pretend to give a shit about her coworkers and what they get up to, nobody cares and if they do tell them and not me. etc etc etc	Sometimes i do get lonely but it's never strong enough to make me think "I wish i had someone". I love living alone, doing what i want, not having to compromise, choosing what or where i eat, when, i love waking up alone, going to sleep alone, i'm just a loner. I really wonder how the fuck i will manage to live with someone in the future. The uncool things are the occasionnal loneliness, the lack of sharing and the lack of human heat.
What's your funniest sex story?	Ended up cumming in her eye, when she screamed something like "YOU FUCKING CAME IN MY EYE" I dipped my finger in a puddle and replied with "yes I did Simba" as I did the simba thing.	My SO and I were making out, things are clearly heading toward intercourse. I am pulling her panties off and she starts talking about her IUD. How she has had some cramping but not too much, how she can 'feel it in there' when she moves a certain way... We have been together for a long time, so NBD, we share everything even if this is a weird time for it. Then, I am like sucking her tits when she mentions how she has noticed more discharge lately from the IUD, so I whisper in her ear, "hnng tell me about that discharge again." She starts cracking up and realizes how insane her chatter has been. Then we banged or whatever.
It seems many young men under 20 show up here to complain that they feel alone and undesirable, askmen- what do you have to say to these young men collectively?	Man the fuck up. **You most certainly know what you should be doing to become more desirable and attractive.** No, playing LoL isn't a part of it. Don't expect to become desirable if what you do all day is go to school, then go home and sit in front of a screen and overeat for hours. Edit: What I'm saying is that it takes effort. If you put in the effort, you'll become more attractive. If you don't, fantasizing about fucking anime characters is all you'll be left with, or you'll have to settle for some embarrassing fatty.	I cannot believe the absolutely negative comments on here. We all went through tough times. We all did. "Piss off life ain't fair", great advice. These guys feel low as fuck and I'll do anything I can to help put them in the right way. I'm sure all of you know about the massive male suicide rate, we all know a guy who killed himself. I do. They felt like how these guys do.
Guys here who're average in dick size: Have you ever been complimented on your penis?	Not about my cock but about my technique. Friend of a FWB told me "She says you really know what you're doing."	I usually get told it's a good size. Which is a nice way of say it's small. Doesn't bother me though because I have a decent sized hand for fisting.
On my days off of work I usually sit at home and don't do anything. I need hobbies. Where do I start?	Try magic the gathering. The community is great and be sure it will keep you busy. I suggest you install magic: duel to learn the rules, and the 12-13 January there are "prerelease" in stores that are small tournament specially for beginners. you can find the nearest one on the wizard locator. This is really a good moment to start it and meet people etc.	I joined a Hiking group. That became a sort of gateway to lots of other fun activities. Now I go snowboarding, snowshoeing, backpacking, climbing, kayaking, running. We also have all sorts of social, regular weekly happy hours, games nights, potlucks and group dinners.
Men of reddit, what surprising or disgusting things have you had to do when you started living with your SO?	same same story. was not pumped for that but really its not all that big a deal after i realized i was being childish. man im commited to this person im active with said person on so many levels why do i need to be freaked out by this. sure i dnt care much for blood but i love the person more then i hate blood. its also a natural normal function.not some icky tale that media drives into ones brain.	The things you see while doing laundry before and after pregnancy; also heavy periods. I know what is happening down there, don't care. I just turn the machine on and forget about it.
Is a refusal to stop using condoms in a LTR a dealbreaker?	IMO as a woman yeah. It's basically telling me "I don't trust you 100%". Especially as someone who's been on the pill for 10 years or so.	Do you have a time limit? Like, do you envision using condoms for...two years? Five? After marriage? In between when you have kids (if you decide to start a family eventually)? Up until menopause, 20+ years? My boyfriend is more paranoid than I am, and I'm willing to use condoms for a few years. But forever?? That would make me sad.
What stereotype about women has the most negative effect on men?	That women consider confidence to be at least as important as appearance. Truth is, confidence and personality mean nothing if you aren't attractive. The idea that women appreciate confidence motivates some men to try to improve themselves for a phantom cause. Once they're continuously rejected after self-improvement, they can feel hopeless and nihilistic. Unattractive men should not be given false hope.	That they're harmless delicate flowers that can't hurt a soul. I've seen many a guy get cheated on or manipulated and refusing to believe that his girlfriend/wife did it intentionally because of how he was raised. Hell it even screws around guys not in relationships who can't see the girl is just using them and has no interest in them. I plan to raise my son that girls can be just as bad as guys, not worse mind you but simply on par. Edit: Y'all are really getting caught up on my wording towards the end. The not worse part was simply to state I don't plan to raise him to think women are inherently worse then men and both can be equally as cruel.
What's a habit that you picked up from your ex that you still do?	When dealing with a woman that attempts to rant, I kiss her to silence her. Odd habit I picked from my ex.	Not to set the alarm clock to something like the full, half or quarter hour, but always a few minutes off. No idea why, but I like it.
Have you ever bailed /been bailed on DURING a date?	When I was younger I would meet girls online and tell them to meet me outside their house at a specific time. If they were ugly I'd keep driving. Pulled this one about 10 times. 7 were keep driving, 1 I married.	My girlfriend was on a date when I walked into a bar on Christmas. She bailed. I got very very drunk.
Does a woman being interested in you make her more attractive?	Yup, this is why more women should go after guys instead of sitting back. You can probably overshoot what you would get by just sitting back.	Am I at least neutral on her or her appearance? Then yes. If I think she's unattractive, no level of her interest is going to break that threshold.
Why don't men get as much of a thrill over fictional romances as women do? Men fall in love too, so why don't they enjoy a good love story? And if you do, what are your favorites (TV, books, movies)?	It's boring as fuck, and reading/watching hundreds of pages/episodes is way too much work to bust a nut. Watching porn is alot easier and more entertaining	Aren't a lot of cheesy "guy" movies fulfillments of what you're asking? Guy gets the girl after intense trials of his abilities of the subject of the movie. Off the top of my head, diehard, dodgeball, shrek, etc. I can't think of any movies off the top of my head where guys are the object of pursuit from women other than movies that are strictly aimed towards "strong females." I could just be drawing a blank here.
What is your radical political idea?	I'm not American so I don't live with this problem but I think America needs gun control really fucking badly. I think most Americans are in denial about this problem. In Canada we have gun control and yes we still have shooting but look at the difference in rates. That can't just be because of population size. America also needs proper healthcare I don't know why conservatives are soooo against universal healthcare. These are probably the biggest reasons I would never move to America.	I don't think these are that radical but depending on company saying I am for legalizing weed and prostitution can get dicey. This from the united state perspective.
How does the dating world change once you move out of your 20s?	The way I see it, it became very merciless You don't have a car - fuck you You don't have your own place - die You don't have enough money - kill yourself	The gulf between the haves and the have-nots gets wider, in my experience. At 25 a guy with no experience is odd, but not unheard of. At 35... well... good luck with that.
Enough relationship/dating posts! Would you rather be a Jedi master, Pokemon trainer or Harry Potter witch/wizard?	Harry Potter wizards are so lame, though. Don't get me wrong, I love the HP books and the story is aight, but I just think that all those bloody powers and things that would actually be helpful are restricted by some rather retarded rules. I'd go with Sith Lord and be happy as fuck. Fuck those jedi dweebs.	I would be a Jedi (in this world). *you will enter me into the payroll system and forget about me* If I'm lowkey about the mind tricks I could be the best investigate journalist/politician/cop/husband ever. Where does she want to go do dinner? "You want to go to Qdoba" *I want to go to Qdoba* ***** "What's wrong" *nothing* "What's wrong" *waves* *Becky got promoted at work and she's a size 7*
Would you date someone who hates curse words?	Fuck that noise. Swear words are just words, words. If you get offended by just mere words then fuck yoouuuu	> P.S. Let's say all curse words, starting from ass and damn. Nah, someone like that's too uptight for me to date.
What was that think your girlfriend said that made you realise she wasn't a keeper and that it'd eventually end?	" i slept with someone while we were dating. It wasn't official bf/gf so i didn't think it would matter."	Somewhere in the middle of a 3 year relationship she told me that she only had sex with me because she felt obligated to do so. :-\
Men - how many of you have genuinely had negative thoughts about a woman because she hooked up with you the same day you met her?	If a girl sleeps with me on the day we met, I instantly rule her out as relationship material. Casual sex is fun, but I don't want my future wife to be the type of woman who has slept around. I'd be very willing to bet that most men feel the same way, regardless of the responses to this post.	I find sex to be a part of a healthy relationship (or friendship, to an extent). I think the only time a man will think poorly of a woman for having sex on the first date is if he was "playing her" from the start. Acting sleazy, disrespectful, asinine and then she still sleeps with him. He never had any respect for her to begin with and even less afterwards.
Men Who Pack Their Lunch, What Do You Pack?	I just pack whichever Marie Callender or Boston Market I grab from the freezer that night. If I'm feeling cheap it might be a Banquet Mega Meal.	Today I have leftover steak and potatoes from last nights dinner. Yesterday I had leftover biscuits and gravy from the weekend. So, leftovers I guess.
Have you ever sat in on a Women's Self Defense Class?	210 comments on a thread about Women's Self Defense Classes and not a single mention of the best all time King of the Hill episode?! THAT'S MY PURSE!! I DON'T KNOW YOU!!!	Once. It was funny. The instructor asked me if they could use me in some demonstrations. I'm not a big guy either, 5'11 or so, 160-ish, tall and wiry with long arms. It was just a whole lot of "No, you need to stand exactly like this and come at her in *this* way, otherwise she can't try to throw you" and "No, turning your hips to shield your groin with your thigh as you grab her is unfair" and "No, you need to attack with your left hand for the move to work, not your right hand" *wtf i'm right-handed and so is a huge chunk of the population..why the fuck would I come in with my left..this is stupid* Ladies, just buy a Taser or something, because those courses are total bullshit.
Did anyone here who got in better shape feel more aggressive than when you were less healthy?	Dropped 70 lbs. I have more energy, I ache less. If I feel any more aggressive it might be because of the private MMA lessons I take. Still have about 40 more lbs to drop, so it could be things will change more around then.	It's not that I feel more aggressive specifically, it's that all these new muscles demand to be used. They don't really care if that's running up the 1 in 7 decline at work or punching some cunt in the face, they just want to be used.
Who here CANNOT do a pull up?	This is actually pretty surprising to me. I don't consider myself in shape, but I'm not really that overweight either. (5'10" - 180-190 lbs, it fluctuates often.) I can definitely do pull ups.	>And it wasn't just one or 2 but a good few. I really don't understand how that's possible. Proper Pull-ups involve mostly the latissimus dorsi, and lots of people don't know what that is nor do they practice exercises/movements that really targets/utilizes it (unlike biceps, almost everyone knows what those are and how to build them). Plus, the more you weigh, the more weight those muscle(s) have to move, so that makes it even more difficult, even for those who aren't overweight yet have a decent amount of mass and weak lats. And it also involves some degree of core stability/discipline if you don't want to flop around like a fish out of water trying to stretch your neck over the bar.
What exactly is progressive about letting your son wear a dress?	Does he identify as a female? I do think we are going full retard on the rejection of "gender roles".	Clothing is just fabric with the one logical purpose: protecting you from the elements. Every other purpose - fashion, in-group identification, etc. is subjective and remarkably arbitrary. In many cases, it's totally pointless. So a guy wearing a dress is fundamentally inconsequential whereas enforcing a "no men wear dresses" attitude perpetuates random social feelings. If you think about it, Greek togas and Japanese kimonos, typically worn by men and women both, are basically dresses. But nobody thinks twice (at least in ancient Greece or Japan) about a man in such attire because it conforms to their respective cultural contexts. tl;dr it's progressive because it fucks with cultural contexts
What is your most extravagant purchase? Something that you didn't NEED at all but bought simply because you enjoy it/desired it. Do you regret it?	When I first got divorced I went out and made a purchase that I kind of regretted. I left almost everything and in my mind I felt I deserved something that was nice, and my own. I built myself a $2,000 gaming rig when in reality I was in a financial position to only be able to afford a $750 one at best. I had huge buyers remorse at the time but am now okay with it now that the debt is gone.	$3k gaming computer; complete with a water loop. The video card alone was around $900. In hind sight I regretted it. It was so over the top, and the worst part was at the time I also helped a friend of mine build pretty standard midtier $1200~ machine that performed pretty much on par with mine. It was then that I learned that money only goes so far with computing, and after that it's just dick measuring.
Men who have been cheated on, what are some red flags that made you suspect that your partner was cheating on you?	I was with somebody for 2 years. I knew as they weren't being their normal selves, we wasn't having sex as much, we was arguing more, she was just being completely off. I then got told a "rumour" that she fucked someone else so I ended it. Now she works in a bar fucking her boss and I'm a salesman with a lovely new car and happier than ever. Conclusion - I'm sure you'll know, I'm not good at reading people but to me it was just obvious.	Vagina tastes like spermicide on condoms. We were married and didn't use condoms. For the record I never intentionally ate a condom but I worked at a condom factory for about a year and when you are surrounded by nonoxyinol 9 and w. messes you know what it smells / tastes like.
What is something you want in a relationship that is politically incorrect to say that you want?	Holy shit this thread is awful. It's just Reddit circlejerking against political correctness and getting mad about things not being politically correct when in reality no one gives a shit.	I just want to date someone who is mentally healthy. Almost every girl I've dated has complained constantly about her crippling anxiety/body dysmorphia/depression, etc. I understand that everyone has their own demons to wrestle and I feel bad for saying it. I really would enjoy the company of someone who is stable and consistent though.
Is 30 too old to sow your wild oats?	Probably, you'll just be that 'weird creepy old guy' at the club that we're all familiar with. I suggest not going activities meant for 20yr olds	30 is not too old by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I'd say 30 is the best age to do it. 1. I'm assuming you have a higher paying job than a good chunk of your 20-something counterparts 2. I'm assuming you're better put together than your 20-something counterparts. Meaning you dress better and have the money to put into dressing better. 3. Being a little older plays to your advantage. You're not young and dumb and you have the appeal of being older to the opposite sex. 30 isn't 35 or 40. Don't try and kick it with 18 year olds, though, because that's just weird. 21 is still too young. You'll have more than enough tail to chase that's your own age.
Students of r/AskMen, what are you studying and what job are you aiming to get with that degree?	Philosophy and English. I'm aiming to be a lawyer, so I just need to keep my GPA up and practice for the LSAT. If I don't get into law, I can always teach.	Medical student, first year, i *hope* to be a doctor. I had the result of my first semester, i don't know how it works in the US but in France the access to the second year is with a ranking, i ended up the 430th out of 3000 students but they only take 230 students so i have to beat up 200 people in my second semester.
What is something you've done with a past exGF that you wouldn't do with you're current/future GF?	Get serious before checking I'm even capable of it. ... Yeah well, mostly what shouldn't have happened with previous girlfriends wasn't really under my control.	Put up with abusive behavior. Fuck that. I love my current girlfriend and she's amazing to me, but the second she starts treating me abusively, I'm out. My ex was awful and it took years to leave. I'm stronger now and I know the signs of an unhealthy relationship. I refuse to let someone treat me poorly, hit me, or manipulate me emotionally.
What are the best and worst comments you received after losing significant weight?	I don't really remember any good comments, but someone said "you don't look any different" after I dropped 20lbs in a week and a half, but i guess that's not really significant weight loss.	Fry: Start with a compliment. Tell her she looks thin. Dr. Zoidberg: [calling to Edna] You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?
Men who are honest/have little to no filter in real life, how often does it get you into conflict?	Constantly. I'm brutally honest and crass. And I can't just let things go. I almost always have to give my two cents on things. Even if I figure out I'm wrong, I keep going. I'm trying to get better about it, but it's a struggle.	I used to be like this, but a comment I read on reddit a few years ago changed me completely. It said something akin to "You aren't honest if you only say what you're thinking when it's negative. If you think someone looks good, or is doing well, but keep your mouth shut, but you'll comment if they look bad or do something poorly, you're just an asshole".
Which pant leg does your penis go down?	I'm probably a shower. And I go down the left leg. Right feels uncomfortable. And just straight forward as some people have, yeah my softie can't fit like that :( would be convenient I think.	Grower not a shower. So my boy goes into Travel mode. Real talk. It's actually super convenient. Cause it's like "damn that's a tiny dick" then boom, fucking summer sausage in both length and girth
How has your clothing style changed as you've aged?	For the first 2-3 years of college I wore mostly t shirts, jeans, and Keds. Now I'm in my last year of undergrad and lately I've been dressing "up" a little more - I'll have my days where I wear a long blouse with black leggings, a cardigan, and ankle-high boots, or I'll wear a sundress with tights underneath. But then some days I go for comfort and wear an oversized sweater with leggings and boots. I've also recently started dressing more "sporty" and going for that whole college girl leggings/Nikes/t shirt and maybe that Northface style fleece jacket kind of look. It's part conformity, part convenience (because then I can go straight to the gym after class), and part comfort because ain't nothing more comfortable than a good, durable, ass-flattering pair of leggings, let me tell ya.	I've got smarter and more groomed. Generally more expensive stuff that's better fitted. In my teens I lived in band t-shirts and jeans.
What do you find to be some common misconceptions among women about what guys want?	1) My girlfriend seems convinced that deep down, I want to be emotional, share my feelings, and be validated, but I'm held back by a society that teaches me to hide it all away. Uhh...nope. I just wanna watch the game, eat some good food, and fuck. I don't have the feels about almost anything. 2) Women in general seem to think that men care a lot about accessories, shoes that match clothes, fancy hair, and crap like that. Uhh...nope. We want you to work out and be fit, dress to show off your hot body, and use tasteful, natural makeup. That's really all there is to it. For me at least.	> you can never text him first This is terrible advice. If she never texts me first, I assume she's not interested and fade out.
You guys got any good stories involving shitty roommates?	One of my old roommates used to bitch about me piling dishes in the sink and never doing them. He put them under the fucking coffee table and left them there for days. #Fuck you Nick.	Old roommates were awful. The #1 reason why I live alone now. One of them got a dog without consulting any of us. He refused to take care of the dog, and locked him in a crate all day. He only got the dog to show off to girls. We ended up raising that poor dog for him. They refused to buy groceries. Spent all of their paychecks on weed and ate all of my groceries within a day or two. Never cleaned the house. They actually complained when I cleaned because "it didn't feel like home to them" when I did. The final nail in the coffin was when the roommate who bought the dog brought a 14 year old girl home to sleep with. She was the little sister of his best friend. He was 22. I don't speak to them anymore.
What do you find to be some common misconceptions among men about what women want?	Women, at least young ones, are way WAY more interested in a guy's looks than generally admitted. They are shallower about this than men. Look at that OkCupid study where 80% of men are "below average"'in appearance. Fat guys get NO action.	The idea that women know what they want and that everything men should care about is figuring out what that is.
Do people actually go up to complete strangers at the coffee shop or in the grocery checkout line, have some witty banter and then go out to dinner? Or have I just been watching too much Seinfeld?	>>> Maybe I'm in the wrong city no, you're in the wrong mental universe. Do you think Seinfeld pulled an actress by sitting at home watching television, or twitter'ing?	It does, but probably not very often, maybe even less so now with all these dating apps/sites. I met one of my ex's at my University bus stops, I was feeling good that day and complimented her band shirt. We talked for the whole 10 minute bus ride and I asked for her number when we got off, and we went on a movie-style first date for coffee from there.
Men, what do you consider to be "immature" in a girl?	Using lol and haha as sentence anchors when texting. Not everything needs an lol on it. Makes you look retarded	No, these are both attractive qualities. Very cute. Immature, to me, usually comes by way of playing games. Not being upfront with me, unable to have an open dialogue when a problem arises, inability to discuss anything of substance, insane jealousy, etc. I don't think natural tendencies that show affection can ever be such a bad thing
Stoic men of reddit, what is something we ladies should know about dating the strong silent type?	It's an appearance. Strong silent types may or may not stay strong and silent if you actually like talk to them.	Nothin irritates me more than when I go somewhere to sit and have a drink and be with my own thoughts and someone starts with the "you need to smile more! Why are you so quiet!?"
My girlfriend and I go to work, eat dinner, watch TV then go to bed. How can we break this routine?	Watch TV before you go to work, go to bed as soon as you get home. Adopt a homeless man. Rename him "the" for maximum cmmunications confusion. Take down all your curtains/blinds and nonce around your house wearing only silken robes. Learn Esperanto. Join a local militia. Take up flint knapping. And if none of that works, try doing it in one or both of your butts. The final answer is always in one of your butts.	I always wonder what other people do in their daily lives. Glad to hear it's about the same as what I do.
What type of girl did you never think you'd end up dating but did?	A big titty half Burmese and Chinese sorority chick that loves dogs and travelling. She was hot as hell and the sex was amazing, but DAMN she was crazy and emotional. A zumba instructor hula dancing, elementary school teacher. She had a really nice ass :). It was a fun few months while it lasted.	Front-woman of a Death Metal band. Its more a hobby of her and her band-mates, but still i never would have imagined...
What relationship/dating mistake did you make when you were younger that you think about now and cringe?	Not sure if this counts, but when your primary material for constant tomfoolery is exaggerated datelessness, insanity and intoxication, it makes other people justifiably reluctant to be in intimate situations with you. edit: In my defense, people did laugh. Most of the time.	I dropped $6k (all my tip money from 2 years of busting my balls) on two days of the "perfect" Manhattan experience. Wine and dined her. Sexy loft overseeing SOHO. Shopping spree. Showed her all over. Found out on the last day she was texting her abusive ex boyfriend the whole time. Flew back home sobbing for my heart and wallet.
What to do when other guys are flirting with your girlfriend?	Ok funny story time. My wife is very naive. When we go out with friends we don't hang all over each other we do our own thing being we are around each other all the time. So I see my wife at the bar and a older gentleman is chatting her up. I swing by give her a kiss not even understanding what is going on until she introduces him to me and he got up apologised and offered me his seat. To which my reply was " sir were all here to enjoy ourselves. You feel free to keep buying my wife drinks if you wish. You warm up the tractor, I'll plow the field later." Then I just walked away lol. Guy was dumbfounded.	Smile and laugh because you get to fuck her later and you trust her to not jump into bed with any random guy who makes a move.
Why do we have cultural trends to combat male preferences for slimmer, or hairless women(among others) but the same doesn't happen for the expectations on men?	Because men are not as picky as women. 80% of men, according to women (OKcupid), are below average in appearance. Women are picky with men and have the moral pedestal. Women are perceived as victims by the evil world patriarchy in our society. Hence women don't face the same societal pressure as men when it comes to their appearance. It only becomes worse when feminist types reinforce the shit values that no woman is attracted to. It's really just a downwards, self perpetuating spiral of perceived female victim hood and perceived male guilt.	Because those "cultural trends" are really marketing campaigns. There not being a real industry for beauty products for men, there is no product to be advertised to us to resonate with our need for validation as "beautiful". I'm sure there are campaigns aimed at us that women never get, either.
When you get rejected, do you expect/demand an explanation?	What?! No. Why does she owe you a date or an explanation? The only explanation you need is that she's not interested and you don't need her to spell that out for you.	In my experience most rejection explanations have seemed like lazy lies. I'd prefer just a plain ol no. Edit: I also think that when men demand an explanation it comes off like he's really insecure. You can't argue with someone til they get attracted to you.
What are your thoughts on asymmetrical boobs?	Is one a totally different cup size? If not they're not really asymmetrical. I guess you haven't seen that many IRL women's boobs but most are not exactly identical. Maybe ask some girlfriends to see theirs and you'll feel better.	No boobs are completely symmetrical. Unless one is ***very,*** ***very*** different from the other, we usually won't notice. And even if we do, we usually won't care. A guy would have to be pretty dumb to be at the point of having sex with a girl, and then be wigged out just because she's a human being.
How can I (F20) demonstrate desire for my bf (M20) before I'm ready to have sex?	"Oh man, I'm so hungry right now!" "Oh, you want to eat some food?" "Nah, I'm not ready for eating yet."	You definitely need to talk to him. If you're worried about it and you think he might be bothered then you should. Do you see yourself in the near future being ready to move in that direction? If so, tell him that. Have a straight forward conversation. Something along the lines of "I'm really enjoying our relationship and I'm pretty certain I want to take this further with you, it's a whole new experience for me, and I really appreciate you being patient with me..." Maybe throw in some cute lines along the lines of "I can't wait to experience those things with you" IF that is how you feel. My gf and I had a somewhat similar situation. Communication is key.
I just had the worst sex of my life. What was yours?	plenty of times. it's when the guy is so selfish that he doesn't care if the girl is enjoying and never asks. the worst part is when he doesn't ask because he thinks he's doing great.	My first time was break-up sex. Pro tip - never lose your virginity with break up sex. There was a lot of sadness and crying and bad decisions, 2/10 wouldn't recommend.
Men of Reddit, what age did you discover that your dream career was not going to happen?	When I turned 6'6", not long after my sixteenth birthday, all my dreams were finally shattered. Still, science was a good second.	You know the funny thing? I have the technical skills to at least attempt my dream job. I just know it's stupid to and isn't worth it. (video game development) Compared to basically any other development job, you get over worked and under paid because of the absurd competition for "doing what you love" I knew going in that it was never going to be more than an idle dream. Especially with how flooded the market has become over the last few years with everyone and their mother thinking they'll make the next hit indie game in their basement and become millionaires.
Men who are at work right now, what do you have to do today?	Radiator in a Chevy, throttle body on a tundra, two wheel hubs on a Monte Carlo, a master cylinder on an old Mercedes, a brake booster in a jeep and install a grill guard for the sheriffs. It's been a busy day	I have a bunch of invoices to approve, rebar and concrete to order, a schedule to make, lots of redditing, and probably some other important stuff that I will end up pushing back to next week because I'm lazy.
Gentlemen, what are your thoughts on dress codes for girls because "it will distract the boys"?	> is our culture just becoming more and more prude? It was never acceptable to have your ass cheeks hanging out of your shorts, have your thong showing, or wear leggings/yoga pants without something on top of it. Only literal street whores wore anything resembling yoga shorts outside of the bedroom. Having a dress code isn't onerous. It also cuts down on girls bullying girls who can't afford lululemon or whatever expensive ass clothes are in style If the boys show up wearing a banana hammock to school, that should be unacceptable as well.	If that explanation is used, I find it insulting. Yes, we are horny but no, a shoulder or some cleavage won't make me go apeshit and be unable to get any work done. Saying otherwise cements the stereotype of men as sex-crazed animals. EDIT: And it's exactly my frustration over this type of thing that has made me a feminist
Stolen from r/AskWomen: Men, what are some culture shocks you've experienced when traveling abroad?	South America is a breastfeeding bonanza continent. There are no issues anywhere. In front of family, in public, around strangers, children or anywhere. Mothers will yank that titty out and the baby just digs in. The mothers do not go to a corner or different room. They do not cover up. No one cares. Except this buffoon of an American who nearly chokes on whatever drink or food he has in his mouth when he sees it.	How aggresive the french (Paris) are when it comes to driving, cought me really off guard. Heard the carhorn go off more times in one weekend then I've heard in my entire life in Norway. I'm suprised I didn't see anyone crash. Also Poland, I didn't know that they had stripclubs/brotles since they're so catholic.
Dog pulled and gf fell and hit her face out on a walk. Probably gonna bruise up. How do I not look like a wife beater when we go out?	You're overthinking this. People who are too quick to meddle or make this kind of assumption have no life and deserve no attention.	People are gonna look and judge, such is life mate. Some women will probably come up and slip her a help line number, that's about it.
What are your worst failures in the bedroom/during sex?	Had trouble getting hard during my first time. Only managed to get half erect despite my best efforts. She must be going around thinking I'm actually only 5 inches -.- EDIT: Ok, to whoever downvoted me. I didn't mean to imply that 5 inches is short :/	Moaned my own name out loud. Was turned on at the thought of her doing it, but i kinda thought out loud.
How often do you cry?	I feel as though a lot of you are either trying to sound like badasses or have some emotional blockage you need to deal with. Just saying. I cry semi often. Used to be that I hadn't cried for a period of about four and a half years. From age 13-18. Then I realized I was overcompensating for certain traumas and stuffing my emotions. Then I cried over everything that needed a good cry. Now I would like to think I cry a fairly "normal" amount. Of maybe a handful of times every couple of months.	Every few months when it's late at night all my bottled up feelings come out for about 10 seconds. Then it's back to bottling them up.#Nurture
Men who married women with "promiscuous" past, how is/was your marriage?	It's going to vary wildly, for obvious reasons, but the statement that "women who were promiscuous aren't fit for marriage/LTR" is patently untrue.	I've had two relationships (was married to one) with promiscuous women who had much higher partner counts. They both cheated on me eventually but the attitudes they shared afterwards is what kind of honestly steered me away from dating promiscuous partners again. The its just sex it isn't a big deal and the what about me attitudes of them both (and experiences I've seen friends deal with also) kind of messed with me. I've been with women who had high libidos and partner counts higher then mine with no troubles, just the women I've been with who had far more casual approaches to sex haven't been compatible with me. For reference I've had 11 partners my ex wife had something around 60 the other higher.
Guys who went from chronically dateless to meeting lots of women: what changed?	Me, and my opinion of women. I improved my appearance and confidence. My opinion of women worsened as a result of interacting with them more and learning more about them. (In before, oh noes, the wrong sort of man answered!)	Honestly? Online dating. I'm an OK looking, reasonably intelligent guy, but I had trouble just asking women I liked to go out. Once the relative anonymity of Tinder and OKCupid got me over that hurdle, I realized that it was really easy to have fun on dates and be my usual charming self.
What behaviour from other men do you find the most cringey?	I will get downvoted but screw it I'll be honest, excessively homosexual men (faggotry), limp-wristed lispy fruitiness, I can only imagine the disappointed father when I see it. Downvoted Brigade Engage.	Being so desperate to be macho and cool that they pick fights over dumb shit and think every single thing in life is a competition. It makes them look like insecure cocksuckers, and it makes them a total drag to be around.
Friend(M20) told me(M19) he cheated, what do I do?	OP don't listen to these girls, they are coming from the girls perspective. If it were the other way around and a girl told her girl friend she cheated on her boyfriend, the friend wouldn't tell the guy either. Sure you might think less of your friend but that's your business. Overstepping your boundaries and handling your friends dirty work for him is none of your business. The only time you would tell the girl is if you are also friends with her in which case it is your business to tell your friend who is also the girl.	What can you do? Nothing. He is an adult and he has to deal with his choices. Don't get too involved in it with your emotions.
How are you doing? Any miscellaneous things you want to talk about or need help with?	I'm doing fucking awful. Women are dangerous to your emotional well-being. They should be avoided at all costs. I'm seriously going to give up relationships if this one fails. I just can't fucking stand another break up. I'll dedicate my life to something else than love. I'll be happier for it.	I know reddit is pretty anti-religion, but I'm struggling with mine right now. Hispanic dude raised in a Christian family, but recently I haven't been praying, going to church, or anything really. Times got kinda tough recently, I lost a good job in December and Tuesday I start school for a couple of Cisco certificates so I can enter the IT field instead of driving again. Long story short, I'm 23 but I feel lost. I shouldn't since I'm still relatively young but I feel like I fucked up not going to college and shit.
How many of you have a female best friend and how has it affected your relationships?	I do. My girlfriend has a problem with it in that she's very flirty, touch/handsy, and doesn't know her well. Edit: just saw your little note. We have in the past. Girlfriend doesn't know the extent, but the way she touches me is enough to not sit well with her.	Yup, she's my go-to confidant for a lot of the stuff that happens to me, and we share a lot of common interests. And nope, never fooled around. She's a friend first, basically just one of the guys, not to mention I'm really close to her husband too. I've only been in one real relationship while we've been close. And that girlfriend didn't seem to care at all.
What are your "moves" in a date?	I cut a hole in the bottom of the popcorn tub, stick my penis in it and bet her 50 bucks she can't empty the tub using only her lips.	I've found that the sooner you can get in the mindset of two old friends catching up instead of two people being on a first date, the more relaxed you are and the more fun it is for them.
Askmen, how do you feel about anal?	i think that it's morally objectionable to have sex with the butt when there is a perfectly good vagina to put your penis in	My girlfriend really likes it, but I honestly don't really care for it. I don't hate it, but I definitely prefer her vagina. I do it to make her happy.
Full time working men, what do you do after work that makes your weekdays a little better?	M, M, fucking, A. Nothing gets the frustrations out like practicing your most violent takedowns and trying to shove a dummy through the floor.	I work out. I work with special needs people and I love my job, but after a 12 hour shift I need an hour of not talking to anyone and lifting heavy things while an angry black man yells about how the tables flipped now we got all the coconuts bitch straight from my headphones
Any story you guys have when after having sex with someone, you had this "I cant believe I just had sex with that person" moments ?	My current gf...... She is so fucking hot, she pursued me, and everytime we're done I look at her in disbelief that I was just with her.... I'm the luckiest person ever....	My bartender. She's absolutely gorgeous. I've had a huge crush on her for a very long time. One drunken night she approached me and just straight up asked why we haven't fucked. So we did. And it blew my goddamn mind.
Guys, I just got rejected and the girl said "You are literally everything I want in a guy but you aren't good looking enough" I know this is cliché af but how am I supposed to feel?	What a tactless cunt geez. That said everybody has different taste. Even you would prefer some girls over others. You have the right attitude.	It's good, she was honest about it. You know where you stand and you can absolutely move on from her. Don't feel hurt. A lot of guys seem to think they will be attractive to the entire female population of the planet. But it's just not the case. So don't worry about it too much.
Do you hump where you pump?	He probably just takes his gym time super seriously. I wouldn't take it personally. Also I wonder the wisdom of getting naked with someone who refers to going to the gym as 'pumping'. You might have dodged a bullet here.	>I took this personally as he obviously thinks I'm a rancid swine. This made me laugh. I can sort of see his reasoning in that he values his gym time and wouldn't want to have awkward encounters with an ex if he broke up or perhaps become known as pursuing women at the gym, but at the same time there are a lot of different gyms out there. If I had such an opportunity when I was single I might have taken it.
Why do so many guys talk to me about not being able to get a girl yet never think to put any time into their appearance?	How much time should I have to put into my appearance? Aren't I "born this way"? Isn't it "all about the base"? Aren't I "perfect just the way I am"? It's a rather annoying double standard where "real women have curves" but "dad bods" are hideous and laughable. It's the same thing with "I don't date short men" being 100% socially acceptable, when there's nothing the guy can do about it but "I don't date fat chicks" is shallow and offensive when they absolutely could do something about it. Maybe he doesn't have time to work out more, maybe he can't afford to whiten his teeth, maybe he likes his haircut. Maybe he's happy the way he is, why does he have to change for a girl?	>I want to tell my guy friends this but not in a mean way. I think you answered your own question. Nobody wants to tell them because nobody wants to be mean, and they never find out.
What is challenging you the most today?	The fact that within the next decade all the power positions in this country are gonna be held by women, and us guys are about to go through the same shit women went through way back when	Baby girl (our first) born early this morning. She's a little early, but in perfect health. She's sleeping on my chest right now. All the feelings; all the worries.
How would you feel if your girlfriend showed a picture of your dick to her friends without your permission?	My girlfriend did this the other day and I had no problem with it at all. Actually it was quite the ego boost cause her friends jaw dropped when she saw what I was packing. Idk It made me smile.	I would be angry because If I wanted someone else to see it I would've taken it out or shown them a pic.
What do you think of "trophy wives/girlfriends" and guys who date them? Do you have any experiences with them?	I think it's a little exploitative of those women to prey on guys who, for one reason or another, can't form any actual meaningful, quality relationships with women, and have to settle for one where they know that their partner's only really interested in them for their money.	I know of at least one succesful couple like that. My buddy owns a pretty big IT buisness, but is not only almost supernaturally ugly and goofy looking (at his best he looks like a crossover of Jack Black and Danny deVito), and really awkward around women. 3 years ago, he married a stereotypical "Russian bride", a girl she pretty much literally hired to be his trophy wife. And despite (or maybe because) the the cynical and matter-of-fact nature of their relationship, they are both very happy with each other. AFAIK, they are essentially housemates who sometimes fuck, but otherwise live their own separate lives, with friends, and even lovers (escorts for him) on the side. They are deifnitely not in love with one another, but are very good buddies, and their extensive and over-lawyered prenup guarantees that their financial relationship will be always steady and smooth.
What do you think about being a 'provider'?	If you are planning to have kids, your future wife is going to go on maternity leave and someone is going to need to pay the bills while they are out. And yes... 9/10, you, as the man, will the leader in the relationship. It is your role. Step up.	I would never be with someone that needed me to provide for them. It doesn't sound like you want that either so just keep dating man.
What do you do to make yourself feel alert getting out of bed early, instead of dragging ass and hating your life for the first 30 minutes?	Set one alarm for when you need to get up and one alarm for 30 minutes earlier. Leave a glass of water and a caffeine pill on your night stand when you go to sleep at night so when the first alarm goes off, even in your groggy state, you can pop the caffeine and take a few sips of water. Go back to sleep for 30 more minutes. When your real alarm goes off, the caffeine will have had time to get into your system. You'll wake up ready to go and like you've just had two cups of coffee. Because you basically drank two cups of coffee while you were sleeping.	If you wake up 45 minutes before your alarm or less, stay up, start your day, you'll feel pretty good. Whenever I try to fall back asleep for those extra minutes, I end up feeling like hell.
Do you know a straight adult woman who's never had a boyfriend or is foreveralone? Why hasn't she?	No. It could happen, and I'm sure there are women like that. But it is uncommon because it is so easy for women to get men. Men tend to be the initiators and they're not that picky, so women don't have to do much to find men.	I know several, in fact most of my closest female friends have never dated. What I gather is that they haven't really met men they would like to date. They also tend to be less open to opportunities along those lines, so that hurts them too of course.
Below average/unattractive guys, how did you start your FWB relationship?	There's no reasonable course of action for an unattractive guy when it comes to dating in any form. Either you make yourself attractive in some way, even if the audience you're aiming for is very narrow or you're fucked.	Yes. An aside; work on what you can work on. Physique and how you dress are the easiest. The hard part is building your confidence, thats a whole nother discussion that is a big ol can o worms. Oh and if you're just looking for a FWB, lower your standards...a lot. You never know when someone you wouldn't think about hooking up with will do it for you in the sack.
NSFW Girlfriends/wives who 'don't feel sexy' or are conscious of their appearance, how does this affect your relationship?	Do you touch and cuddle nonsexually? Sometimes, women want romance and intimacy before they can feel sexy. We need to feel loved and cherished. If your wife sincerely thinks you are lying when you call her sexy, she doesn't feel cherished by you.	It's tiresome when I initiate and tell her she's gorgeous and burn with desire for her but she throws it in my face and calls me a liar. It just doesn't work long term when she insults or rejects her partner for wanting her because she hates herself.
What does it feel like to get a girl pregnant?	as a man, having sex with your wife for a planned pregnancy is one of the most demeaning experiences you will ever have. a lot of men will say the same thing	Depends on the girl, I would assume. Me and my wife were trying for each and every one of our kids... so, it was pretty exhilarating. If it wasn't intentional, it might have been more terrifying. I will say that with all of my children, initially holding them was terrifying. It doesn't matter how many newborns I had held, I was always terrified that I was going to hurt each and every one of them. Don't get me wrong, I held them, and I was/am an involved father to three wonderful kids (if you can call a teenager a kid... at least she's not driving... yet). But they are always so tiny, and so fragile. I was always terrified that I would do something to hurt them.
What are your thoughts on taking a consenting disabled individual to a sex worker?	I think that's very sweet. Just find a decent escort, don't just pick up someone on the street. Do your research and find the right girl for him. Swap a few emails back and forth, and don't be afraid to ask the girls for recommendations on who they think might be good if they don't want to do it. Just understand that most won't discuss actual sex acts over email.	If It were me, I would. Just take all the necessary precauctions. Make sure he understands the situation and don't let him think that it's anything other than pay for sex. Explain that the woman are doing it for money and even if they say they like you it isn't true.
What is the worst case of selfish wedding bride "It's MY day" you've ever witnessed?	Technically it is her day. Every wedding my wife and I have gone to or participated in we did as asked.	It was a stinking hot, humid day, and nobody wanted to be outside for the outdoor wedding. We were doing wedding party photos and everyone was dripping in sweat and about to pass out, so we decided to finish the rest of the pics in a nice shady spot. The bride threw an actual, honest-to-god tantrum because she wanted to make the party hike all the way across the venue grounds to get shots in front of a full-sun pond. None of her bridesmaids wanted to do the ten minute walk in their heels and it would have been a terrible spot for photos, which we mentioned. She pouted her way through the rest and they divorced a year later.
How many times do you text a girl before moving on?	Give her your number. Let her text you. That way you know she's interested. (Reading the post seems like she texted you first anyways) Text once. If she's interested she'll reply. If she's not interested you have no reason not to move on.	If I have already have texted her twice then I won't bother until she'll reply. If she doesn't reply then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ and move on...
What's a opinion about love, dating or just being a guy you want to share...but don't want to devote a topic to?	For a long time I had weird anxiety about the idea that if my girlfriend were to leave me I'd be stuck dating desperate late 20s/early 30s women who didn't settle down when they were younger. And then I realized I can just date women in their early 20s forever. A weight lifted from my shoulders.	I'm uncomfortable with expressing emotion and I don't know how to get passed it. Honestly, my dog died and I had to dwell on it and "force" myself to cry. Kinda weird, right ?
What universally beloved thing do you hate?	Network TV Lil Wayne Basketball and Soccer (I understand they take talent to play but I simply don't care for either sport. More of a Baseball and Hockey guy). Bernie Sanders Weed- For the record I am 100% for the legalization. I have nothing against smoking it, I simply don't want too. How I Met Your Mother	I have nothing against Beyonce as a person or artist. Even though her music's not really my cup of tea, I can admit she's a great singer, performer, and dancer. Her FANS, however, are totally ridiculous. It's a cult.
What's the most awkward conversation you've had with your parents?	My mum decided to tell me about her menstrual cycle throughout her life and then how manapause effected her. Awkies	My mother once asked me to get her weed because she wanted to try it. I didn't smoke weed though. So many awkward questions in my mind that day.
How happy (or sad) are you as a lone wolf?	Not really according to society, its just human nature. People are social animals. I aint gonna tell you how to live your life and maybe you convinced yourself that you're content, but you're really missing out on life by limiting your experiences. I go through 'lone wolf' phases, but I'd rather die than live that way forever	22, in college, single. I'm happy and sad. I like to be able to focus on what it is that *I* want with minimal drama, plus I can flirt and hookup with as many girls as I choose without being judged (as long as it's safe sex). On the downside though, I don't have sex nearly as often, but the worst is at night. I just want a girl (whom I care about) to put her head on my chest and both fall asleep.
What will you never tell your S/O?	I prefer to be alone more often then I like spending time with her. She isn't the prettiest girl I have dated.	We didn't accidentally leave the cookie dough out. That cookie dough didn't go bad... I ate it. All of it.
I believe paternity leave should be equal to maternity leave in terms of time, pay and rights. What do you think?	It's unnecessary. The mother needs time to heal. The mother is mostly needed in early childhood. It's been that way for millions of years. Early man didn't stop hunting because he had a kid. He did what he had to do to care for his family. This is just a new trend by entitled assholes that want to get paid to not work and stay home with their video games.	Female here. In Canada, the woman has to take the first weeks (I'm not sure how much), as basically recovery time. Pregnancy ain't easy on the body! The rest of the year of leave can be split between the parents as they see fit.
Women of AskMen, what's the best advice you got from the awesome guys on this sub?	And it is now officially Mar 14th Ladies. You know what that means! NOW go forth and show these men in your lives what you have learnt here and repay that awesome Valentines Day he gave you last month!!	That guys like it when women take the initiative to ask them out, to initiate sex, and that men like to get complimented too. **Spelling
What kind of women, in terms of background/past, would you never date?	Past? Who cares, as long as her present is ok? If there are things in her past that fuck up the present, like STDs, or being hunted by the FBI, that's one thing, but if she's right now, who cares if she wasn't beforehand?	In my experience, a woman who has had a long off-and-on-again relationship with someone. That's always going to hang in the background and leave you wondering "Am I just her 'rebound guy' until she gets back together with her ex?"
What do you think about drinking in front of children?	It can be a little weird. My cousin has been taught that "alcohol is bad" so its a bit weird when someone in the family brings a few bombers of beer to Thanksgiving. My friend has a big family that is not afraid to drink around the kids. That can be weird. But they are not my children and there are usually a number of people sober. So I enjoy myself.	I think it's perfectly fine. I don't drink much anymore, but my wife will pour herself a glass of wine or make a mixed drink around dinner time or whatever, and I see no issue with that. My kids know what alcohol is, the dangers of over use, and of course, that it's not for them until they're much older. If anything, I think exposure to responsible use is probably a good thing.
How was your experience with Tinder/Tinder pro?	I see no reason for Pro, even though I am a professional Tinderer. So far it's been great. I've probably met up with over 200+ women from Tinder in the last 3 years. It's great for me because I travel for work, so it makes meeting women in strange cities exceptionally easy. I still do plenty of Tindering, but I've shifted most of my attention to Bumble which is Tinder, but with less trash on it.	Do the free version. Pro just adds more swipes and like an undo option. The free one still gives plenty for you to work with.
How do you feel when a guy flirts with your girlfriend/wife in front of you?	Punch him EDIT: I don't but if he doesn't stop and being annoying I will. At least if she's obviously with me but if she's out and about I don't really care.	If he doesn't know she's in a relationship, then it's amusing to me. No harm, no foul. If he knows she's in a relationship, that's disrespectful to me and to my girlfriend.
Men of Reddit: Where is the weirdest place you found one of your girlfriend's hairs?	On MY toothbrush. We both keep our brushes in the shower but they are ip high where youd think hair wasnt going bear.	One of my ex's long hairs (her hair was down to her lower back) somehow wound its way into my video card cooling fan and completely jammed it up and caused it to overheat.
[Serious + sensitive] What would you do if you knew your unborn child was going to have a disability?	Whatever you do, don't abort the baby. Have you considered the possibility that the doctors could've made a mistake? Before I was born, the doctors sat down my parents and talked about the very high probability that I would be born with down syndrome and proposed aborting me. Well today, I am a straight A college student. Just think about that.	Abort. Life is hard enough being a normal functioning person, bringing someone into this world with a clear disadvantage is just cruel to the kid, and not fair to yourself
Do Women Demand Too Much From Men? How Much is Too Much?	>Do Women No women aren't one thing, if you ask if all women do something then the answer is almost always no.	There really isn't a such thing as asking too much, just being unprepared for the reality of not getting it. Dating is a world where you don't get what you deserve, you get what you can acquire. A woman of average looks can expect a decent amount of attention but not the overwhelming shower conspicuously attractive women get. Who she is to make one of those men think that he doesn't need to consider someone else is up to her.
Men who have been intimate with both men and women, what are the greatest differences?	I haven't had many partners but I'm guessing that besides physical differences like genitals, there's going to be more of a difference between people than genders. In previous threads like this I've heard that girls are better kissers, although I haven't found that to be true personally.	Skin is a big one that rarely gets mentioned. People with male sex hormones are just rougher, and their skin resists moving more. Obviously this shifts a little with body type, but not as much as you might think. The reason is estrogen. It actually causes thinning of the skin, leading to a softer feel, more pliability, and increased sensitivity. I was in a relationship with a trans woman before and through her transition, and it was hard to believe I was feeling the same person's skin after her hormone levels were corrected. This is also why women tend to be more susceptible to cold temperatures. ...I feel really creepy talking about skin this much.
What podcasts are you listening to?	Ignorant philosophy Joe rogan Adam Corolla & dr drew show Bill burr Ari Shaffir skeptic tank The bone zone podcast Ted hour Stuff you should know	- Death, Sex & Money - Freakonomics Radio - Hello Internet - Lets Make Mistakes Together - On Being - Rooster Teeth Podcast - Stuff You Should Know - The Art of Charm - The Co-optional Poscast - Think Again - Waking Up with Sam Harris I also used to listen to - Cortex - TED Radio Hour - The Patch
What are you old fashioned about?	If a girl takes you home the first night you meet her, she is not the girl to take home to your mother. Right or wrong, i dont know or care. But what i do know is that my wife made me work for it and we are still going strong 11 years later.	I have sex with a girl only if she is officially my girlfriend, and we have agreed to an exclusive and committed relationship with each other. I have never been into casual sex and hookups. Intimacy just doesn't feel right to me when it's with someone who I don't love; I've made out with girls who I was not in a relationship with and while that was enjoyable, something in the back of my head told me to not go further than that.
How much cash is a good amount to carry around in your wallet?	On a regular basis: None. I don't like cash, it's more of an inconvenience than anything. If I'm going somewhere where I need cash, or say, going out to the bars for the evening: $100.	I usually have ~£20 in my wallet, unless I'm going on a night out in which case it's generally closer to £50-60, because paying by card in a club is insanity.
What sparks an almost primal rage inside of you?	* Bullies. * Ideological differences. Often times I can have a conversation about politics, economics, gun control, etc without losing my shit. But sometimes, with certian people, I lose my shit. SJWs, teaparty folks, coworkers voting for Trump, sometimes they make me lose my shit. * People who can't admit hotdogs are sandwiches.	Being accused of lying when I'm telling the truth. I don't know why, it makes me fly off the handle.
What are things you shouldn't say to the girl you are talking to?	Never discuss her weight. When a female coworker told me, 'I lost 15 pounds over the summer', I responded, 'Aww, don't get discouraged, they've got to be there somewhere', while looking directly at her hips. Another time, a *very* skinny girl I was dating was talking with her friend about thigh gaps, and I said something like, 'It must be nice to be able to shit while standing'. Awkward and uncomfortable silences, in both cases.	>Girl I've hung out with quite a bit and met her parents but nothing sexual done...(I'm 21) I want to masturbate to her and show her through snapchat. Risky but not sure... So what you're saying is you never want to see this girl again...
What's the dumbest thing you ever did as a kid/teen?	Am I the only person that never did anything dumb? I hear so many people on reddit talking about them being "stupid teenagers," and I'm sitting here like, why would you EVER think that was a good idea?	I tried to kill a spider with gasoline. Me and my friends were lighting off fireworks in my backyard using gas to light off multiple bottle rockets at the same time. Someone saw a spider on the ground and we got the bright idea to set it on fire too. Well, we poured gasoline on the spider and set it alight at which point the spider sprinted towards the open gas can and kamikazied itself into the gas can. Which exploded into flames and turned into a raging inferno ten feet high. I had to sprint inside and grab a fire extinguisher, and to this day (10 years later) my parents don't believe me when I tell them that a spider was what nearly burned our backyard down.
What are you ashamed of about yourself?	I use feces as a lubricant when masturbating. And on particularly heavy days, I like to make a shit pussy. A lot of work, but the experience is exhilarating.	The way I look My complete lack of self-discipline and motivation My anger management problems My lack of people skills My self-centered, arrogant view of the world. Most of myself, truth be told.
A girl pulls the 'ol "Did I leave my earrings at your place?" trick but you don't want to see her again. How do you get out of this?	"Those were yours? I'm sorry, I gave them to . . . someone else . . . I could call her and ask for them back - I'm sure she didn't mean to. . .(click)."	Drop them off at her work, while she's working, to the receptionist. God forbid they were her deceased grandmother's, but you know how luck would have it.
To those who are gay, at what age did you know?	I wonder why people don't ask at what age straight people knew they were straight as much. Or to ask generally at what age did people know their orientation without specifying the orientation.	11, I had a brief period (about 6 months) where I tried to deny it but then I started watching Six Feet Under with my parents and I accepted it. I've never tried to pretend I was bi or try to be straight. I did remain in the closet until I was 16 though and I've been a big homo ever since.
Dudes with long hair, how did you survive the awkward in-between stages?	if you have long straight hair, pony tail works, not that man bun shit. I myself have long, curly hair and it just does it's own thing and I stopped giving a shit about looking like a retard awhile ago. When I'm working outside I usually just wear a hat to keep it out of my eyes. Sorry about your dad OP. If someone gives you shit about your hair looking stupid just say "yeah well i'm growing it out so i can donate it to cancer patients for wigs" and they will shut up.	Well, I was fifteen years old and played World of Warcraft at the time, so I was oblivious of the real world for the worst of it.
How do you feel about period sex?	FUCK YEAH!!! Is how i feel about it. My girlfriend doesn't use any contraceptives. We use condoms, of course. But come period time it is bareback and come inside that's on the menu. I have a hard time containing my excitement that time of month. And yes i am aware of the risk we are still taking. If we have kids now, while taking this risk now, we'll just have to deal with it.	With my girlfriend? No problem, might just use a condom to keep my willy clean. With a random girl from the bar? That's an other story.
So I [25M] have been asked 3 times in 12 hours to hang out with a coworker [18F] outside of work, how do I tell her nicely that I don't think we should be hanging out outside of work and still keep things good in the work place?	First, number 1, foremost... contact HR, and tell them you've been asked out by a coworker three times, and you will be turning her down. Do not file a complaint, and inform them that no action needs to be taken, you just want this in your record, in case things go south (and they can go South). Second, tell her that you don't want to mix your personal and business life. If she loses her mind about it, and starts getting ugly, then you've got the note in your HR file that this was what happened, and these were the steps you intended to take. If things go back to normal, then no harm no foul.	Folks are saying here to just tell her straight up and they're right... but you specifically asked about also keeping things at work good too. The fact is... it might not be possible. Saying no to her is obviously the right thing to do, but she may or may not take it well. Those are the breaks. It might blow over as no big deal at all, or she might get butthurt. We don't know you or her, so there's no way to tell. Do your best to be polite and considerate, and then hope for the best.
New girlfriend's abusive ex-boyfriend is threatening me, how do I go about this?	you grow a pair and knock him the fuck out! simple answer=man up or pay me 50 bucks and ill do it!	Keep records, report it to the police and attempt to get a restraining order for you and her. If you know your neighbors, give them a description of the guy and tell them to look out.
When it comes to hygiene, Where do you draw the "unacceptable" line?	I shower whenever I know I'll have to go outside. So 99 percent of the time outside of the odd weekend day which is take out and surf the net. Honestly if I can notice it. Not clean teeth is number 1, also with longer hair daily shampooing is a must.	> The "no poo" movement of people who refuse to wash their hair ever. It's not using shampoo, not refusing to wash their hair. Shampoo pulls the oils out of your hair more so than just showering does. If you have naturally dry/coarse hair, it's just making things worse. If you have greasy hair, it's useful.
What are the top 5 qualities you search in a girl and top 3 that you avoid as much as possible?	*Top 5 requirements: Attractive Good to talk to A good person Independent Has a good career *Top 3 no-nos Fat Is crazy. Kids.	Looking for: 1. Similar sense of humor 2. Somewhat medium maintenance 3. Has her own life 4. Hand Eye Coordination 5. Likes the outdoors Avoid: 1. High Maintenance 2. Emotional Baggage/Bumpy relationship track record 3. Narcissism
Very obese guys (400 lbs +) - how do you urinate without making a mess everywhere?	>400lbs I hope no one here is in that category, I HOPE SO. I mean ~250lbs would be a good WAKE-UP CALL for ANYONE to take it down a 1000 notches.	This will likely get buried but at my heaviest I weighed around 460 lbs, it definitely wasn't easy but it was manageable. Going sitting down was almost impossible, using a urinal required way more effort than it should. I definitely made more messes than i'd like to admit especially while inebriated. I'm currently down 85 lbs and going strong though and things are significantly easier all around.
What have you discovered about your ancestry or lineage that you didn't expect?	That I don't give a fuck about it. I was always trying to figure out this shit or that shit when I was younger. Then I realized, I live in America. Bloodlines are dead. And nobody gives a flying fuck about your heritage.	My great uncle ran the Haitian secret police and tried to grab power before being put in jail and summarily excuted. Good times
Gentlemen. What do you NOT give a fuck about?	Feminism in developed western nations. At this point it feels like they're fighting based on a ton of strawman arguments and misconceptions. Yes, I have a cock so maybe "I just don't get it", but seriously whatever "oppression" women in these nations seem to be suffering is fucking extremely minor at most (from a population stand point) and I'd argue it's starting to have a net negative effect. I can see the relevance 15-20 years ago. Not anymore. The media time and energy spent on feminism could be better spent on a million other issues today. Maybe I do give a fuck...	The private lives of almost every celebrity ever. I genuinely struggle to understand the fascination, it just doesn't interest me one iota. Edit: I guess a lot of people agree with me.
Hey guys, I'm old, so when did the "friendzone" change into what it is now?	some feminists weaponized it a few years ago, so now if you say friendzone, they'll act like you expect sex for being nice.	It has always had multiple meanings since I became aware of the concept in the late 90s/early 00s. The initial "proper" meaning was when a woman uses a friend as an almost boyfriend but wouldn't actually date them. See also Ladder Theory.
What was the stupidest thing you heard anyone say, or saw them do, about money?	Anyone who says something like "now is a good time to invest in the stock market." You can't time the market. Also, people who call things like diamond engagement rings, or expensive watches investments. No they are not.	My perpetually in-debt friend who complains about how poor she is: "I just bought a super cute new pair of shoes!" "I thought you were going to stop using your credit card" "No no I bought these with real money, not my credit card." "YOUR CREDIT CARD IS STILL REAL MONEY."
How would you like to be objectified as a male? If at all?	If we could switch with women on the objectification part, trust me, women would clamor to have that perk back in their lives within a year. :P	I had a girl in class that always slapped my butt atleast once a week because she thought I had a great butt. I miss her.
Would you prefer to be able to run at 50 mph or fly at 10 mph?	>Would you prefer to be able to run at ~~50 mph~~ 80km/h or fly at ~~10 mph~~ 16km/h? I was confused by the outdated an backwards measurement, so FTFY. Or rather, FTFEveryonewho'snotfromtheUS.	So the way I see it, All you have to do is fly STRAIGHT UP and use a wing suit to fly waaaayyy faster using aerodynamics and gravity .
Excluding touch, in what ways do you subtly flirt? What are some things you'd do for a girl you're interested in and not for a girl you weren't?	Yesterday a girl I have no interest in spilled her drink. She said she had it so I sat there and stared at her. Had I cared I would have came back with a rag and polished her shoes if she wanted.	Touch is definitely a big one, but there are plenty of visual and verbal cues too. Simply talking, building that personal connection, flirting with/teasing her, etc. Just crank up the charm and capitalize on that sexual/romantic tension. When it comes to verbal flirting, I like to use a lot of "we" statements. Not in a "let's-get-hitched-right-now" way, of course. More in a "Bonnie and Clyde" way, how *we* can get up to all sorts of trouble together. It's hard for me to explain it without concrete examples, but it's fun and it builds rapport. ~~Then I whip it out.~~
Have a great girl to date except not really attracted to body type. How can I get over this to be 100% content with her?	lol, i am the opposite of you. while i appreciate a small nice body with small boobs i have a big boob fetish and am fine with the overweight as long as we are not talking too much. at some point it is not healthy.	If you date her when you aren't attracted to her, you're doing a disservice to both her and yourself. And IMO, if you're having to work this hard to feel attracted to her...it just isn't happening. For the record, I've made this mistake with guys, thinking it's okay I wasn't that physically interested because they were otherwise great. Both times it was a mistake, I couldn't "teach" myself to be turned on by someone who just didn't do it for me. (Btw, I'm assuming physical attraction/compatibility is important to you, but I know some people don't consider it quite as crucial in a relationship as I do.)
Moving in with 2 men as a female. What should I know?	Make them clean the bathroom equally!!!!! I've lived with 1 guy and 2 girls for the last 3 years and my gosh, the hair and grime that accumulates after bro-man hits the gym is absurd. He's one of my *best friends* but has not once ever gotten down on his hand and knees to scrub the dead skin, piss, blood, fecal matter off the toilet bowl. Edit: added word	My GF lived with me and two other guys in a 3 bedroom place many years ago. A few notes from past experience. - You and your boyfriend should each pay your share of the rent. With 3 people, each person should be 1/3rd of the rent. - Setup a division of labour before there are any questions about who should be doing what. - Generally don't live with friends if you want to remain friends. There are exceptions but overall living with someone as a roomate will eventually end your friendship (either actively or you'll just fade out). Edit: I should clarify that I mean being a roommate with someone you were friends with before being a roommate.
Why are so many men homeless? What can be done to help them?	For the same reason that the suicide rate of men is 3-5x higher than women. Nobody cares about the problem's of men, if you show emotion, you are immediately looked down upon. Divorced? Take half your money and your kids. Can't provide for yourself? Fucking loser. I am not going to downplay the struggles that women have, but men have their own too, only we can't talk about ours without subtly (or not subtly) being looked down upon.	I know a lot of it has to do with being veterans in the military. Having more support for our veterans would be a good start.
Men of Reddit, is the male posturing between father and boyfriend a real thing? What was your best or worst story of meeting the dad?	no its not.....im black i date mostly white women, never had a dad act weird towards me, so if they are fine with me they are fine with the white guy that came before or after me	My date for homecoming (in the sticks of Georgia) came out and met me with a baseball bat. That was pretty awkward. My current girlfriend's dad is a gun collector. For the first few months of dating her, he had a habit of checking his ammo whenever I came in the house. Nothing like the click of a magazine being loaded into a pistol to welcome you to a house. It's a real thing. I always take it as sort of a joke rather than an actual attempt to intimidate, though. It's a sort of stereotype and if I was the father in that situation, I might have a little fun with it
What's something you shouldn't really feel guilty about, but you do?	Not feeling guilty about a bunch of shit that seems to really gut a lot of you gents out there. Sometimes I read a set of neurotic, self-absorbed posts about crushing shame this and anxiety that, and I wonder if I'm the crazy one for not having anything to add there.	I carry a little guilt that I didn't try to mend bridges with my old man before he died. I was there at the end at least, but it wasn't a time of reconciliation. I prob should have been more willing to forgive. But I didn't. And you can't go back in time. So fuck it. It doesn't bother me any more. Mostly.
Do any of you not watch porn? If so, why?	I don't. I disagree with a lot of it ethically, and if I am feeling hiring I just have sex with my SO anyhow. I don't personally need to watch other people fucking for variety or whatever. Edit: thought I was in askwomen but whatever. Still applies.	I try to watch as little as possible. Right now, it is around once every 10 days. Although my sexlife was never terrible, i have found that cutting porn and masturbation to as little as possible has really improved my sexlife. I now experience way more powerful orgasms, and i never have trouble going 'full mast' due to being more turned on. Before, i had trouble finishing, but those days are over. Condoms used to be a big problem for me, but now i can both maintain my erection and finish. Of course, i still prefer to go sans condom, but now it is not as much of a problem.. All in all, i have been really satisfied with my decision, and i hope that i can kick the habit completely, at some point.
Former AskMen smokers: How did you quit?	Third family member died of heart/lung disease. Didn't want to be the fourth. So I quit 'cold turkey'. I know this probably won't help you but that's just my experience.	Switched to vaping 2 years ago. The day the vape arrived in the mail, I quit, and it was pretty easy. I still crave the ceremony around cigarettes - beating down and opening a fresh pack, the fresh tobacco smell that always reminded me of raisins, the lighter, that first puff. I miss cigs. But I've tried then since and can't handle the taste anymore. I remember it being so much better than it really is.
Are "separate bills" tacky or the norm now when dining with friends?	I think separate bills is totally tacky. Just split the difference, any minor differences can be sorted out in tips. It all works itself out in the end amongst friends	Cash is too much of a hassle so yeah separate bills. It also makes more sense seeing as people order different things at varying price points. Salad and bud light for one person while the other gets a filet and top shelf manhattan etc
Men: what compliment about your body would you like to receive from women?	Here is how women flirt with men: Look in his general direction for 3 continuous seconds. Then just sit back, he will do all the work from there.	Just be honest. Last thing I want is for someone to call me some muscular Adonis when I already know I'm not.
Men, regarding your committed significant other's Tinder use purely for "ego boosting", what are your thoughts on this?	As long as she's not going through with meeting guys and letting them buy her drinks or something then I'm okay if she gets a little ego boost over seeing how many people swipe right. It seems pretty harmless to me.	Yeah I'm against this. I wouldn't wanna be with someone whose self esteem was so low that she needed to get random matches on tinder to feel validated
Men of Reddit, what is it like to have a dick and balls?	At the very least having male genitalia makes it more difficult to get sex. So many more hurdles to go through just for a hookup. A guy has to have game, a semblance of looks and can still be shut out depending on the whims of the woman in question.	>Any struggles Random boners happen. Mostly when you can't use 'em. >benefits No menstruation. *It's also like a built in water gun. Destroying a urinal cake is as satisfying as the other side of the pillow. >inside jokes If I laid my dick on your keyboard it'd go all the way from A to Z.
What is the riskiest wank you've ever had?	On a public transit light rail train. I was late and there were only a few people on it, but I had it all out of my pants. Young me was a mix of ballsy and really stupid.	Jerking off inside a filthy port-a-potty, in Balad, Iraq, to an AAFES catalog, in 130 degree heat, during a mortar attack. I was a horny, sex deprived 19 year-old and thought my scrotum was going to explode if I didn't bust a nut. Mission accomplished.
Why does it appear that many parents were much more successful than their adult children of the same age?	At 23 your parents parents said the same thing to them. And their parents the same, etc etc. However, whining about it certainly makes you come off less adultish.	Simply because things were easier for them back then. My grandad was a engineer for Rolls Royce, he got the job simply by walking up to the factory and asking if he could have a job, and they gave him a low end job which he then worked his way up from... These days grades seemingly mean everything, although my current job is very well paid and I wasn't even asked if I could spell my name.
Men who had their first romantic/sexual experience in your mid-20s or later, what is your story?	I was 24 and got my first real kiss and lost my virginity with my first girlfriend on our second date. We were so sunburnt after the whole day at a country music festival but I didn't feel a thing until after. I came so hard when she was going down on me that I actually hit myself in the face and chest. I clumsily ate her out until I rallied though, I am a gentleman after all.	I played video games all day in high school and college. I never put myself out there and became a fat slob. I ended up leaning on friends and roommates to be socially active, but I actually tried to meet new people and make any new friends. Eventually I got sick of being who I was and I started putting effort into myself. I graduated college, got a respectable job, and lost a ton of weight. I finally started putting myself out there. I started online dating, met a cute girl, and we hit it off. The rest was history.
Men, we've heard of the 'red flags' that make you nope out. What are your 'yellow flags'?	Filthy mouth. I cannot stand women that think it is attractive to talk like a bunch of dudes at the pub	black & white thinking. Not being able to see the "grey", the parts where you can agree on something in between. Makes fights pretty hard. Also seems stupid. You probably can live with it, but it can be hard in longer relationships. Edit: TIL some of you would not be able to be with my current GF
How Do You Feel About Harriet Tubman Replacing Andrew Jackson on the $20 Bill?	Completely hate it. Andrew Jackson was a defining president in the history of the United States. He was instrumental in the battle of New Orleans. He had a huge personality that made him well known throughout his time and America would so different without him. Harriet Tubman was helpful in ending slavery but she should not be replacing Andrew Jackson. He deserves a spot on the $20 bill.	My drug dealer is going to have a hard time accepting this, as he does not stay up on current events. This could cause some real bloodshed in the streets!
How in shape are you guys?	I'm obese. I run 3 times a week and try to lift weights for strength, but my hormones are almost non existent so it's hard to lose weight and/or gain muscle. I can't afford the prescription steroids, so lift/run/be fat I shall be	I run around my farm a lot. I don't actually do any real exercise. I know I can outrun a goat.
How to tell my girlfriend I'm worried about her getting fat in the future without coming off as an arse?	> She'd run and used to be on various volleyball teams. Unfortunately due to work and a shitton of stress, those activities had to be put aside Also, she's now in a relationship, she can let herself go.	You can just say that you're worried about her health because all she eats is fast food. Fat or not, that kind of diet is just not good for you. If you make it about her getting fat and unattractive to you, that's what makes you an asshole. But at the end of the day, you can't force her to change. If she doesn't want to work out and doesn't want to eat better food, well, that's her decision.
Stolen from r/askwomen with a positive twist. Men who work in a female dominated career, what's the best thing you've been told or experience you've had with one your coworkers?	I'm an adjunct professor in an English department and I guess the best thing I've been told by a female coworker is that she doesn't plan to teach next year. A lot of the female adjuncts are married, and once they realize how shit the job is and how little they need it, they bail. Hopefully that gives me a little bit of job security going forward.	I work as a teacher in middle school - split is approximately 3 male teachers to 18 female. I had three different female teachers tell me that I was doing a great job connecting with students and to keep up the good work. Made me very proud.
Question for guys who are US citizens: if the US gov't were to reinstate a military draft, what would you do?	Maybe I'd move to Canada. I'm a citizen there as well, plus I have some family there. Ain't no way I'm going to war. I'm a sensitive artist, not a soldier!	If I was younger, I would do the same thing my grandpa did during world war 2: go and enlist so I could choose a path other than front line infantry. I'm 29 now though, so I probably don't have to worry about getting drafted.
Do you guys ever ponder why it seems that in a general sense, women want men less than vice-versa?	Men are supposed to be the romantic ones. I want a romantic woman too. I like to be wined and dined before I get fucked too, ya'know.	According to the evolutionary theory, having sex for women tends to be more "expensive" than it is for men. Females have one large expensive gamete (egg) every month. Meanwhile men have millions of gametes in each ejaculation. On top of that, if a female gets pregnant, she is guaranteed a pregnancy and nursing which is costly in time and resources. Males are not required to stick around and help raise the offspring. So, because sex tends to have more consequences for females, they are more choosy and picky. They need to make sex count. For men, they just need to make sure their sperm gets spread as much as possible, so they tend to be less picky and more willing to do it. Obviously, this doesn't apply much to today's people, but that mindset is probably still there subconsciously.
Guys who have been divorced, what was the day after the filing like?	I didn't know the day of filing I wasn't talking to my wife, but the day I got served my papers saying it was over was a day I was heading out on vacation with my very beautiful gf of the time. I was happy it was all over.	The day I got my certified copy of my finalized divorce decree and drove the second copy to my ex in-laws, they said they only time they ever saw me smile like that was when my son was born. I had some damn energy that day, and felt on top of the world. The actual day I filed though wasn't really anything special it was a long time coming and just a step along the way. When it was over... is where it was at for me.
Men with daughters, at what age will my little girl stop letting me give her a big hug in front of the school when I drop her off?	I hope never, but I know I'm wrong. I don't have a girl mind you, but a little boy that makes my day every time I come home.	Depends on the kid. I have 2 daughters. One wanted me to stop around 12, and then started hugging me in front of her friends again a few years later. The other is older, and never stopped. Slightly OT....NEVER STOP HUGGING THEM. There will come a time when you will feel really uncomfortable hugging your daughter, putting your arm around her, etc. The first time you realize she no longer has the shape of a little girl...a lot of men feel a little weird. But don't stop. Don't let on that it makes you uncomfortable. When she starts going through puberty, doubts and discomfort ABOUND in her heart and mind. And if Daddy, who has always been affectionate and loving, all the sudden pulls away from hugs, right at that time, it can be very hard for her.
How did you find the haircut that fit you?	Go to the affluent town near you and find a salon (that's not one of those chain salons like Supercutters). Ask for an advanced-level stylist. They're paid to know what looks good on you. You get what you pay for. Go a barber and you will look like you get your hair cut at a barber.	There was an upscale barber shop at my college that was run by attractive women and only cut men's hair. They also gave you free beer while you waited, which was awesome. So I went in one day and asked them to do whatever they think would look best. That was 8 years ago. Been rocking that same hairstyle ever since. I'd recommend you do the same and go to a place that specializes in men's hair.
How do you handle the "what are you looking for?" question when a girl asks it early on?	Never ever ever answer this question in a straight-forward manner. You *always* have to deflect this. Any definitive answer removes the mystery and she'll lose interest. You have to be vague and charming, but not dismissive. The key is to get her hamster running and create/increase the sense of mystery about you. I promise, if you leave it open-ended, she won't run away, but be intrigued. You need to go with this: "What do you want? What are you looking for?" Then you answer some version of "I'm looking for new exciting experiences. And I'm looking for company to experience whatever life has to offer." It's good. Suitably vague, but positive. And doesn't answer "girlfriend/ltr/fwb/wife." If she presses you, "What does that mean?" You answer, "What I just said: somebody to experience life's adventures with." She'll fill in the blanks with whatever she wants.	I'm a monogamy fan so I would always say "I would like to take this seriously, and take it as long as we can." "As of now I don't see this having a defined end, so I want to continue that trajectory". Last time I said that was 10 years ago last night. So far seems the trajectory has maintained it's overall direction.
Have you ever "broken up" with a close friend? How did you do it?	Neither of you are the same people you were when you were close growing up. It's perfectly natural for people to mature at different rates, develop different interests or acquire different sets of values. People will come and go in your life for many reasons. You don't need to "break up" (as annoying as he seems, I'm sure you wouldn't want to never talk to/see him again, nor hurt his feelings, nor burn any bridges). Just make yourself less available and let the friendship fade on its own.	If the person won't leave you alone, or is actively making you a worse person, I'd say you should "break up with them" as you put it. But if you just don't like them anymore, just stop hanging out with them and talking to them more than absolutely necessary. No need to make things dramatic if you don't have to.
Guys, can we talk about how messed up dating culture has become?	I just feel like all these "dating apps/sites" made the process of actually dating and getting to know someone and ruined it. The process of actually building a relationship over the course of actual dates seems to be the way of the past.	Being straightforward starts with you. Gotta be ready to get some flack back, but if it's what you want, you'll find people who want the same. This will also presumably change as you get older, at least it did for me. By the time I was in my mid 20s, everybody was desperate for people to stop spinning bullshit. By 30 people tell you what's up on the first date.
After 12 years of marriage, I am now separated and wondering - what do I do with my life now?	If you are actually good looking with a great career you'll fuck a lot of women. It just a buffet out there.Get on Tinder and see the magic. Date women in their mid 20s, you're just 33 ,still pretty young. The kid thing can be a dealbreaker when the relationship gets serious,but you can still get laid	My only comment passing through is don't lose sight of your daughter. She will one day be a woman and how you are with her now will greatly impact your relationship with her in the future as well as her relationship with men. Date as much as you like but don't expose her to it. She is going through enough already and doesn't need to worry about losing daddy. Keep her prioritized. Dump any woman who shows the tiniest bit of jealousy for your time spent with your girl. If I were single I would absolutely love to date a man with children. I love kids! But you want someone who respects that it is you and your ex wife raising your daughter and not someone who tries to compete. Best wishes.
What goes through your head when a woman you find attractive tells you she's a graduate student or has a high level degree (M.D., PhD, etc)?	Men that are worth your time won't give a shit. A decent number will see it as a plus. I doubt that you entered your field based on the opinions of men, why should you care now?	"Oh. Well I guess she won't be interested in me." would be my gut reaction. So many guys would be better for her than me. It's not nice but it's reality in a lot of cases. A lot of studies of relationships show that women are far less likely to "date down" in terms of education level or social class than men.
Has anybody here ever had their "relationship intuition" proven right? What happened?	And yet, whenever some guy post on Reddit that his GF is being "so unreasonable" about his good friend, who *just happens to be a woman,* but there is nothing between them and GF is just paranoid. . . The Reddit brigade starts shouting about how she is a controlling bitch. How come AskMen gets to claim this as "relationship intuition"?	Yes, same thing essentially here, cheated on me and started dating him the second we were over. I guess when you are close to someone you can pick up on something like this, as in it kind of feels off.
What's the best NSFW compliment you've ever received?	An older female coworker (she was like 20 years my senior) had a habit of slapping my ass playfully. I like to think it was because she liked my backside.	The first time I went down on my girlfriend her immediate reaction was a genuinely surprised "Oh!" followed by "why are you so good at this?" It felt good.
What do you think about women who are taller than you?	I've got no problem with a woman being taller. But in *almost all* circumstances a women will prefer a taller man. When you go online what is the NUMBER ONE thing a girl asks for on her dating profile... a *taller* man. Not a man with hair, not a man that doesn't smoke, not an intelligent man. A *taller* man. So this question is completely academic. Better go ask the girls "what do you think about men that are shorter than you".	Not even a negative for me, but often a dealbreaker for them. My girlfriend is four inches taller than I, and I was half-expecting it to be an issue for her. After a while, I just bought in that she wasn't bothered and didn't secretly prefer a taller man and that's that. It's fun. I'm a leg and ass man anyway.
AskMen, how did you become friends with your best friend/closest friend?	We were both young working at retail, and wanted a designated driver when he went to the club. I was 18, he is 24. So I went and realized they let me in with a special band. Well, long story short, he's ugly and the chicks hit on me more.	We met in English class 9th grade. He turned back to me and said, "Hey, you're Asian. Do you like video games?" I did.
How do you start a conversation with a girl at a bar?	I don't because why would I? She's just going to find me repulsive and I'd only waste her time. I'm there to drink, not bother people who have no interest.	I usually walk up and ask if one of them ( specifically the one I'm interested in) if she wants to jump in and be my pool partner because mine just bailed or something. I find that usually about 75-80% of the time they'll play, then playfully joke around a bit about how bad were gonna win/lose whatever Keeps pressure off, keeps the conversations light and gives you a bit of a chance to get to know her and start flirting. Win or lose you can usually get a drink with them after, or two...
How can you tell if the girl you are seeing is loyal and won't cheat? What are some things you look for?	Okay, the SJWs on this page will have a field day with this, but: Does she have many female friends or is she mostly just together with other men? Chances are high that she's a cunt and other girls are seeing through her bullshit so they don't like to be together with her. Those girls also tend to have those male friends for attention or an occasional boredom-fuck. How often does she party? Does she get drunk often? I wouldn't say that a girl who loves to go out is a red flag, but it can sometimes be an indicator. How was her sexual past? Super high partner count or not? Did she cheat in another relationship before? None of these are dead-tell signs of course.	There's a really simple test you can do at home. Get some vinegar, get some baking soda. Then make a big clay volcano. Then while this is erupting, call your girlfriend to come see. If she's too busy sucking someone else's dick, she is disloyal.
Men who are married, how much did you spend on the ring and wedding?	Yeah...we're poor, and seeing some of these comments makes me realize how poor we are =[ Her ring was $2200, it's a moissanite and palladium band, with a matching wedding band. No idea how expensive mine will be, hopefully cheap. Total on the wedding, as of today, was just under $10,000. We have private land to do it on, and both our families are well respected in the community so we got some deals. She bid on a 3 day 4 night Vegas trip at the Mule Deep Foubdation banquet, we got it for $220. A good family friend is thanking me for keeping his son sober by paying for our plane tickets, both ways first class	The engagement ring was one month's salary after taxes. The wedding was paid for by our four parents. The honeymoon was one month's salary after taxes.
Men, how do you usually refuse a girl?	I'm not the kind of guy that girls approach when they're attracted to me. One of my old high school friends who had a crush on me (but was in a relationship) told me that I came across as mysterious. I don't really buy it, but then again I don't really see myself the way others see me. I think women just give me signals and wait for me to come talk to them, which I wouldn't do even if I was attracted to them because I have better things to do than worry about dating. Which is kind of funny, because girls are more attractive to me when they make the effort to actually be my friends first.	I'll try to distance myself from physical contact and conversations will never be more than small talk. Pretty much all girls I've come across seem to take the hint.
How do I tell my girlfriend that her screaming during sex is a huge turn off?	Loud girls usually have it a turn off to not be loud. She might like the pillow trick or the ball gag, never hurts to explain your preferences and propose to explore solutions. But it looks like you two have incompatible sexuality.	Invest in a ball gag. Tell her its so you can spice up your love life. But you'll know what it's for.
What is the hottest thing a woman has ever said to you while sexting?	I personally don't like sexting outside of pictures. The whole painting a scenario thing is just incredibly uninteresting to me unless I can actually do what we're talking about right then. Plus it's usually just meaningless words that never actually happen. My idea of sexting is a girl texting me and saying "Hey, do you want a blowjob tonight?" That would turn me on.	Funny thing is, its usually not during sexting. Usually were having a normal conversation and she will send "I really want to suck your cock tonight". The lack of context makes it seem to matter of fact, like sucking my cock is an item on her grocery list. Its surprising and sexy.
Have you ever looked back at your previous crushes and went "what was I thinking"?	Well, in the US... 1/2 of all women become hamplanets with age. So at least that many of your crushes are going to seem really sketchy by the time you are 40.	Yes. I think it's the ones where you no longer find them attractive that are the worst. It's sort of a mental puzzle to try and work out what your thought processes could possibly have been at the time. If you see some girl you once crushed on, who was not a great person, who cheated, and whose life was pure concentrated drama...but she still had boobs bigger than her head, you at least know you were just betrayed by your penis again.
Tips for women being on top?	These guys are saying more grind and horizontal stuff. Well that dosent hit all my buttons. Bouncing up/down, kissing, eye contact, scratching, biting, punching (like down on the chest and not too hard just sexy hard), hair whip (just like one whip every five minutes. hand placement, different bounce intensity, changing positions using the other hole, ball fondling, licking (you may want to talk about that first, and best of all being vocal. Say some freaky shit. EDIT: y'all are so nitpicky.	A lot of women just bounce straight up and down. Getting some horizontal movement in there really helps, and kissing and doing mouth stuff while you're on top makes it so much more intense.
What is the most embarrassing SFW thing you are into?	I listen to a ton of folk punk despite my hatred for the scene and the kids that populate it. Not really that embarrassing, but every thing else I'm in to I fucking rock without a hint of shame.	I'm into ASMR. I wouldn't say I'm *embarrassed* of it, but it's not something I would bring up. If I were asked about it, I wouldn't deny it (happened before).
How do I not keep this fucking cat?	Does it really need to be said? There's no excuse for animal cruelty. NONE. Find a no kill shelter, or an animal rescue group, and give the cat a better life than it would have with either one of you two. Fuck. Seriously.	> Now my mom is telling me that if I go to a therapist, the therapist can license the cat as an "emotional support animal" Your mom could have done the same thing.
Men who didn't want kiddos and had them anyway, which of your original concerns with having kids came true? Which didn't?	I thought when I had kids that I would cease to exist as an individual. I actually feel 1000 times more alive. When I meet an older adult that never had kids I kinda feel sorry for them.	All of them. No personal time, super expensive. Constant attention. No more vacations for the first 3-5 years. Destroyed house. Everyone in your business telling you how to parent.Your relationship with your wife will be eroded and tested to the breaking point due to a lack of time with each other.
What does rough sex mean to you?	>I've asked her what she likes and she's been pretty vague Yeah because part of her desire for rough sex is that she wants to be dominated. You asking her nicely what to do kind of defeats this purpose.	Spank her, grab her, press her into the sheets as you stuff her, pull her arms when you enter, playfully choke her. Anything beyond that you need to get to know her better first.
Men dating someone famous, how's it working out?	I am not dating a 'social media celebrity' and I don't think I would. I hate social media, and the idea of people becoming famous for how carefully they're able to curate themselves to get the right persona of hot and interesting makes me gag. Being famous for social media is not so different for why the Kardashians are famous. It takes a level of vanity, narcissism, and focused attention to something I can't stand to get there, so we're probably a bad match.	I knew a guy who hooked up with a chick from High School Musical. He is gay now... so he is dealing with that.
How often do you worry about being considered creepy?	Never. You work on social skills and these things aren't a problem. Every once in a while I might show interest in a woman and she won't be interested. But why should they make me uncomfortable?	Pretty much anytime I'm near a woman, no matter how long I've known her. I think about it while I'm walking down the sidewalk (do I smile and nod as I pass by to show I'm not a murderer or does that make me creepy?), when I'm liking or commenting on a woman's social media (what time is it? how old is the post? Is she wearing anything revealing?), trying to figure out where it's safe to direct my eyes in meetings or social settings (how long should I maintain eye-contact while she's speaking? oh god did I zone out in her general direction?), etc. Plus being a black guy I'm 1000% hyper aware of how I might be perceived at any given moment, so I sometimes feel like I'm tiptoeing through a minefield.
Women of r/AskMen: Why do you like hanging out here and what is you favorite thing about this forum?	It's the substantially but still only relatively less uptight version of askwomen. You get a few who think abd act like cavemen here but still beats mods putting words in your mouth.	> Why do you like hanging out here? I value learning about male perspectives on things. >What is your favorite thing about this forum? Men.
I've heard of single women considering adopting a child but never a single man. Have any of you thought about it or actually gone through with it? How has that turned out?	There are a few reasons for this and YMMV among individual men but most men, if they are going to adopt and invest the time, effort, and resources into a child then they want the child to have his genes. Also, adoption agencies are very, very, very cautious about providing a child to a single man. Cuz **obviously** that man must be a child molester.	Not done it myself but I work in a field where I deal with adoptions. It is rare. I fear the system doesn't see any single man as a resource unless he has proved himself far beyond what any other adoptive resource would have to do. That said, I have nothing but positive things to say about the single men I know that have adopted. I wish there weren't such a stigma.
What's the weirdest thing a girl has done thinking it was sexy?	When ever my wife drinks more than a couple beers she starts to tell anyone who will listen about the size of my cock. She goes on and on. This has happened with neighbors, family members , her friends. When I ask her to please stop she just says "if you have it flaunt it". She seems to really enjoy it because she gets really wild in bed afterwards. However it makes me really uncomfertable. Yes, I have asked her to stop many times and she always says she will and she apologizes. Then it just happens again.	Buddies GF claimed she put all the veggies he had in the fridge in her vagina. So he could taste her when she wasn't around. That was just the tip of her crazy as we found out later.
What finally clicked in your mind that changed things for the better?	Financing a car is awesome. I used to only own cars that I paid cash for, and they were all a bit dubious. Now I have a sweet car that's way more than I could buy outright, and the monthly payments are only a small percentage of my income. Plus, free oil changes for life!	"I am working my ass off in a miserable job so my boss can get rich and while I try to provide an unsatisfactory lifestyle to a woman who thinks deserves better".
How is 'being a man' different today then it was in previous decades?	I know one thing. Seems like men today have no guarantees and everyone wants to sue them.. These days it's nothing to have your wife leave out of boredom and take everything you own.. Then send you a monthly bill.	I think today with all the talk of gender roles, sexism, fluidity, what is a man depends on who you ask. What this means is whatever type of man you are, you have to own it, Because any type of man can be attacked as being the wrong type. You like to work out and watch sports- stereotypical dude. You like to play video games- nerd. Skinny guy that dresses nice- metro. Work on a ranch- red neck. You just have to be you, ignore all the bullshit.
Why are more men doing Tea / Coffee Meet Ups for first dates in this modern age?	On another note, from what I see in my female friends, the more a guy *invests* on the first date, she'll be more likely to think he's serious and sincere, hence more likely to reciprocate. Some girls tend to invest less emotionally if they feel the other party seems to just test around. What's so wrong about it? Girls know why some guys want to do cheap dates with them. Those who don't, they naturally stand out. If you don't feel any need to *invest* and she doesn't seem that interested, just move on to the next girl/guy. You didn't lose much as you planned so.	Dating is expensive. Going out for coffee is vastly cheaper than going for a full dinner before you even know if you like someone. And if you don't like that person, it can be a 20 minute date instead of an hour where you have to fake an emergency call to get away from the crazy.
What are men's unrealistic expectations in regards to romantic relationships and where do they come from?	That we're all looking for our perfect virginal girl who will give us the best sex we ever had, on demand. Comes from porn.	Some men, including me in the past, can expect romantic love to fill their entire need for emotional intimacy. Like they save a lot of "stuff" for confiding exclusively in the people they date. Women on the other hand tend to have a wider range of friends they are emotionally intimate with. To me this comes from stereotypes about masculinity meaning stoic, emotionless, invulnerable and that sort of thing. I think all my relationships improved with learning to confide in friends more.
For guys who use dating sites: which one has been most successful for you?	Okcupid, but it's not the app that's the problem here OP. if you aren't getting dates and matches, it's you. #toughlove	OKCupid, by a long shot. Partly because it's been around forever so I've been using it longer, but also because you actually have some room to express yourself. I pull people with personality better than pictures, so this works for me (back when OKC had individual journals, just a silly piece of writing a day got me tons of dates). I've met one girl off of Tinder, but we've been dating a few months.
Seriously, what do I need to teach my son about cleaning his penis?	I'm circumcised and I just kind of lather it and wash it, no further work needed ~~If he's uncircumcised then I think he just first needs to pull back the skin, wash, rinse and then let go. Maybe lightly dry it with the skin back? I don't know~~ I guess I shouldn't have answered the second part	Also for both circumcised and not. Don't try to put soap in the pee hole. I tried this when I was about 4, and I regretted it. It's painful. Just don't do it.
What do y'all think of girls wearing chokers?	Hipster sluts who tend to pose as feminists on Tumblr tend to wear them alot. Be prepared for some bomb head and a headache.	Not to be trusted. They take them off and they go from super babe goth chick status to wrinkly old crone with a dusty vagina.
Dads - when you play board games, video games, etc with your children, do you let them win or no? Why or why not?	I try to balance games of chance with games of skill. Games of chance, they can win honestly. Obviously, the younger they are, the less skill they have. What kind of asshole would self-congratulate for beating a beginner when they're an expert? That's gross. I teach them the skill, not shame for not having the skill. Teach them the big lesson, that practice is critical to acquiring skill.	I switch off. They will win some, but damnit they will lose some as well. They need to learn how it feels to lose, and how to react to it so they aren't shitheads later on.
Those of you who didn't know what you'd do after high school or college, where are you now?	about to blow a mexican midget tranny in the back of my 92 ford escort for 6 dollarz of gas money	Lots of shitty retail jobs. Joined the military. Got direction in my life. Got out and had them lay me to get my college degree. I was unsure if I wanted to go back to do federal work or private company. Took a job in Manhattan in digital marketing. Loved it but something was missing. So, I became a cop and love it. Some people need time to come to understand what they want to do in life. I am one of them.
What's the story behind your worst date, in which you were the guilty one?	I once picked up a girl from hers that I was told had lost loads of weight since high school. She hadn't, I just walked around miserable the whole date and did not message her again. I'm a bad person :(	When I was younger I would go on a lot of online dates with this particular story I was on a second date with a girl and it wasn't really going well. I could tell that she wasn't particularly interested and neither was I so I was just going to cruise through the night and be done with it. At this time I was hooking up with my neighbor. While my date was in the bathroom I texted my neighbor saying that I'll be done soon and to stop and get some beer from the corner. I accidentally sent that text to my date...she came back from the bathroom saying "so I got your text..." I pretty much panicked, apologized profusely and we both admitted the date was not going well and we called it a night.
What is your go-to method to approach women you don't know?	I just make eye contact with them and smile, they usually come and say hi, if they look away then I leave them be.	"Hey... could I... Um..." *stare at your shoes* "I mean, how are... um... what is... um... never mind." *walk away.*
How long were you with your SO before your first argument and what was it about?	Few months in. It was about the relevance of philosophy to physics. Ended in slammed doors, yelling, not talking to each other for a while, and just general pissy-ness. Stupid thing to argue about, I know. Most of the arguments in the beginning were like that. One of us is an MA philosophy student at a top university. The other is an undergrad physics major who listens to science popularisers too much. Not that they aren't brilliant in their fields, but they are just fantastically wrong about philosophy. We aren't together anymore (broke up just after the two year mark) but we are still close friends. Unrelated to the physics/philosophy thing.	Depends how you define debate vs argument. Debate I'd say w/in 10 minutes of meeting her - it's one of the things that attracted me to her in the first place. Actual argument - probably a month or two - though they became more frequent (and eventually settled down) when she moved in with me.
A woman tells you she wants you to humiliate her during sex, without specifying how. Should you be worried about being too good at it?	I'd be worried about going too far and accidentally traumatizing her somehow. Not to mention I'm a virgin and have zero experience with sex, so I have no fucking clue how to "humiliate" somebody in bed.	no, but you should draw a line around what sort of humiliation is in play - "you're just a dumb slut, only good for keeping my cock warm": ok, "you drove your mother to drink": bad. remember, it's roleplay, and there are always limits.
What is the most hurtful thing an SO has said to you?	"You're such an attention whore." After telling him repeatedly to please not do a certain thing around me because it triggered my PTSD. I heard this in the middle of a flashback I was having.	I've said this before in other threads: "I only married you because I wanted a baby." Said after we'd been together 10 years and our child was 6. That was meant to hurt me, and it did.
how aware are you of a girls body during a hug?	It really depends on the situation but generally I don't really focus on a girl's body when hugging. Hugging is primarily a mechanic that demonstrates emotional proximity, which can coincide with physical attraction but it doesn't have to. Sure, when I hug my best friend I can feel her warmth, smell her really good and feel her boobs pressed against me. But I am primarily just really glad that we met, can sit down and spend some time in this busy world. This pretty much describes my position. I might want to add that I don't just go around hugging girls I don't really know, so...	It's hard to analyze her body without the correct samples, so I always make sure to discretely take body fat %, water levels, height, weight and a blood sample while hugging a girl for the most through results later.
What's a sacrifice if any that you have had to make in order to start succeeding at dating?	Cliché', but I had to stop being a *genuinely* nice guy. Not a NiceGuy^TM but a actual, genuine nice guy who just tried to treat women well and wasn't just out trying to get laid. Once I started being more of a dick and didn't really care whether I (emotionally) hurt women, my dating life picked up significantly. I didn't really like the person I had to become, but I got over it.	Money. Getting in shape, eating well, buying new clothes, etc. all cost money, and dating itself costs money too. I had to come to terms that this was an investment, and that I wasn't going to see any dividends until I put some money, time, and effort into it.
How many things from porn have you tried in real life? Did you crash and burn or was it better than expected?	Porn is real life too, those are real people really fucking. I don't really see a distinction between porn and real life. I think I've tried pretty much everything that looked hot to me in porn, with some exceptions that I'm just not strong enough to do (fucking someone while also carrying them, lifting them up with one hand, etc) With some partners it went more or less the same as it was in the porn, with other partners not. Everyone has different limitations, people with fewer physical and psychological limitations can pretty much do it exactly like it is in porn if they so choose.	Bounced my dick on an ex's cheek once cause I saw it in porn. She just kind of looked at me and I just looked at her and said "I don't know what I thought that was gonna do." I guess it worked out because we had a good laugh about it. Another ex wanted to see what all the hype about oily tits was about so we tried it out. It looked ridiculous, but they felt amazing. She rubbed them on my dick and we found out that was a move for when she was ready for me to finish. That one came from watching porn and I would say it was a success.
Everyone has that one girl they can't get out of their heads. What's she like? Are you with her?	She's not even that great. She just has a hold on me because of the passion, although it matters less and less as time goes on. We dated over two years, really connecting, but she was a selfish, insecure wreck with daddy issues, that legitimately could not be alone. I'm sort of broken and traumatized due to that relationship.	We never even dated. I've never felt more comfortable around someone of the opposite gender than I was around her. Our lives took separate paths and now I just hope we see each other again. Trying to figure out if I should try contacting her even though it has been a few years. I'd drop everything and go find her if I knew she would be happy to see me.
Men who voluntarily choose not to have a girlfriend, why don't you want a girlfriend?	women are annoying needy have expectations want too much talk to too many guys that are "friends" - lol wastes time getting wasted and drunk (atleast most chicks my age wanna do this) and they just don't want to have 1 guy, every girl ive ever tried to GF always has like 3+ guys on the go - fuck that i've been single for 10 years now, going on no sex for 5 - i LOVE it, i honestly don't think ill ever date/have sex again, life is 1000x better when you're not concerned with what ass you wanna pound next	At the moment I'm voluntarily being single because I have a bunch of shit I need to focus on sorting out (getting dental work done, buying a car again, moving to a new apartment, etc) and while I COULD do those things in a relationship, it'd be financially a lot more difficult since I'd be spending money or time (the latter of which can be used to make the former) on a girl instead of getting those other things fixed. I'm also enjoying having no obligations to another person at the moment, and I like being free to do what I want with little repercussion for another person besides myself. Just a bunch of shit really - I've had relationships and I've enjoyed them but I can live without one just fine for the time being.
What are your immediate thoughts/assumptions when you see a girl with a crazy hair color?	Wow. I had no idea that people thought so much about how a woman wears her hair. I've got purple hair. I'm a grownup with a good job and a family. I also don't really give a single shit about what anyone else thinks about my appearance. I'm happy with me. This thread really opened my eyes though to how small minded and judgmental people can be. I really had no idea so many had such strong judgments held toward HAIR COLOUR. Will it stop me from wearing whatever colour I want in my hair? No.. Apparently it weeds out the assholes.	This question would be a lot more interesting if you also asked people their geographic location. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area; there's a slightly different culture than say, rural upstate NY. Oddly dyed hair means different things in different contexts, in my experience.
(M) I don't chase, I feel like I'll be alone forever because of it. How do I break out of this?	/r/MGTOW there is nothing at all wrong with not chasing. You can date if you want, but only on your terms. Avoid long term relationships. Never ever marry. At 28, you're starting to build up your wealth. Do NOT give half or more of it away to some skank.	As a guy, you can expect to kiss zero girls if you never go in for the kiss. Now before you debunk that as a false absolute, which it is, that is to mean that most girls are out there waiting to be plucked. They almost all feel like you. You won't meet the ones that don't in a meaningful way unless you get some experience and confidence, and for that, you gotta go steal some hearts. Don't buy into this hope will make good things happen bullshit Hollywood sells us. The world doesn't give a shit about any of us. If we want good things to happen, we need to *make* them happen. Waiting around for what you want to just appear is putting your happiness into the hands of a very improbable dice roll.
What subscription services do you use?	- IADC Safety Alerts. - OGP Safety Alerts. - Manufacturer Technical Bulletins. - NOPSEMA alerts and bulletins. - UK HSE alerts and bulletins. - WorkSafe WA alerts and announcements. - SPE notices. - APPEA notices. - Various other industry and technical sources.	Spotify. I love it. I get to legally pay for my music, I can take it on the go, it's extremely good quality and I like that musicians do get some of my money and that fact that I might not like some albums that you'd pay a fairly large amount for. It's opened up music for me, I'd never pay for it legally otherwise.
Men, What are you trying to learn right now?	What the hell does もっとガバーッって mean in the context of a cheerleader who should spread her legs more in the performance. No fucking reference on the Internet about this ガバーッ stuff. Can't ask prudish friends because that might have NSFW connotations.	28 years old, I'm reteaching myself calculus on khan Academy so I won't be behind when I go back to college in the fall. Wish me luck! Edit: wow this blew up! Thank you guys for all the motivation! I'm working 50+ hours a week right now and coming home every night to "math homework" but I'm beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel!!
Men of reddit, how do you guys approach a girl at a party?	Check out r/seduction for some better advice. Don't have a canned line that you use on everyone. Do it as soon as you think about it and don't give yourself excuses not to. Do not approach on an outcome basis i.e. because you want her number, kiss her, fuck her. Only approach because you want to. Talk about whatever you want. Be playful, sarcastic, unpredictable. Touch early and often, don't greet with a handshake always a hug. That's basically the TL/DR of seddit	"Hey :) How's your night? I'm BFG *shake hands/cheers drinks*, how do you know [party thrower]?" and then you should be good to just chat. If you're not getting any vibe from her you can always finish your drink and excuse yourself.
What are your favourite podcasts and why?	Not to be negative, but I hate pod casts. It's not just pod casts, it's talk radio too. And radio stations where the DJ's talk more than they play songs. I guess it's just me, but listening to other people talk bores the crap out of me. I would say it's because I'm old, but I've always been this way. Given how many folks enjoy this, I'm just weird.	My Brother, My Brother and Me. It's an advice show where they take the questions from Yahoo answers. The three brothers have hilarious banter and it's often brought me to laughing in tears. Also, The Adventure Zone. Same people as above, but their dad comes in as well and they play a game of D&D. Also hilarious.
What is something about sex for men you wish females knew about but for some reason, they just don't know or understand?	Have sexy "after shower" clothes, seperate from "sleeping clothes". *come home from work, shower, put on something sexy, have sex if everyone is in the mood. This works especially when their are kids in the house and you can't get started right away. Put on something that he loves to see you in, but won't creep the kids out. Not lingerie, just not big baggy pjs. The pjs are for sleeping.	A penis doesn't come with an on/off switch. It doesn't get hard or soft on demand. If a guy can't get hard, it doesn't mean it's broken or that he doesn't like you. It a guy gets hard at an inopportune time, it doesn't mean he's doing it on purpose.
How do I tell my girlfriend that it makes me uncomfortable when she talks about sexual experiences with different guys over the years?	Well actually she could have worded it better and made that position a suggestion, rather than saying "ohh with such and such he was so good at this position" It's almost verging on emotional abuse, jealousy. THAT is a bad thing since it makes you feel this way. How long have you two been together? Is this the first time you've ever felt this way about something she has told you about? Tell her how you feel about these things. Everyone has a past, not many people want to know about the intimate details. I had a girlfriend until recently that, when we first started dating, would gloat about these kind of things, even point at apartment buildings where she had had ONS's. Guess what, 11 year later it still makes me sick thinking about it. That's emotional abuse.	"Hey -- it makes me uncomfortable when you talk about sexual experiences with different guys over the years. We both have a past, and that's fine, but I don't need details."
Men who have predominantly female careers (Teacher, nurse, etc), what's it like? How do women react?	I'm a microbiologist. A lot more females in this field. It made me more empathetic. I don't think it has influenced my choices in attraction or dating behavior. Also I don't notice any difference in treatment from my colleagues or students.	I'm a nurse. I work in the ER, so I'm around a lot more male nurses than I would be if I worked on a floor (other than the ICU). I don't notice any difference in treatment by my female colleagues nor by other men I meet. I'm married so dating isn't a concern but I've noticed that if I'm getting coffee or at the store grabbing breakfast after a shift (I work nights) I get checked out a lot more than I do if I'm in regular clothes.
What are some of the biggest mental blocks men really bad in dating have?	Asking women out and dating has always come really easily to me... and that's because I don't take it particularly seriously and I don't treat a woman's reaction to my advance as a judgement of my worth. The vast majority of the posts I read on Reddit regarding dating and concerns guys have about is... are tied up in the guy being overly analytical and putting way too much weight into what happens. The absolute worst thing that can happen if you approach a woman and she rejects you is that you are *exactly where you were before*: without a date with said woman. It's like looking for a job. You will never be employed if you don't look. The worst that can happen if you look for a job is that you end up in the same position: without a job.	Thinking that no girl could possibly be interested in them. Thinking that whenever they say something to a girl, she's responding only out of courtesy, and is thinking to herself ''Does this guy really think that someone like me could be interested in someone like him? He's ugly and pathetic. Why is he asking me if I come to this bar often or do I listen to this band usually, when both of us know that it's just a ploy to get him talking to me, get my number, and eventually ask me out? Why doesn't he simply cut to the chase so I can reject him and be done with it?''
My Girlfriend is going to breakup with me. What do I do?	Everybody here saying "go to the meeting", but I'm not sure I agree. Personally, I'd send her a text saying "If you want to meet up to talk things out and you think there's a real shot for our relationship, I'd like that. However, if you're just meeting to break up with me, then tell me now and let's not." Just what I'd do anyway.	How to get broken up with like a mature adult: 1) Show up with your head held high. 2) Have an adult conversation. 3) It's OK to show some emotion, but don't lose it. 4) Say your goodbyes, go home, cry in the shower to a sad song.
If Instagram is where the attractive and photogenic spend their time what does that make Reddit?	Reddit is where the morbidly obese neckbeards congregate to do...whatever it is neckbeards do. Oh, and where the socially awkward or anxious can say whatever they want.	In The Office, James Spader's character criticizes the Black Eyed Peas as rock for people who don't like rock, rap for people who don't like rap, and pop for people who don't like pop. Then maybe reddit is 4chan for people who don't like 4chan, tumblr for people who don't like tumblr, and pinterest for people who don't like pinterest.
What are your fetishes?	Skinny white men. I am a bigger black women and I like to beat them and humiliate them. Payback for centuries of oppression ;) Edit: yay I am getting attacked for my fetish!	I'm submissive, so basically everything stems from there, with limits. Actually, I'd probably be a switch, but I'm submissive most of the time.
Men who've grown up in cultures where women are often seen topless, are boobs still sexual for you?	Sexual attraction is why human females have permanently enlarged breasts, which is an exception in the animal world. IOW, boobs are innately sexualized.	I've seen quite a few boobs and been to quite a few topless beaches. It all depends on context to me. If I'm in a sexually arousing situation and I see tits, they turn me on. If not, and if I'm at the beach, seeing someone breastfeed or just changing a shirt, then I'm not typically aroused.
Men, when was the last time you felt so defeated and just wanted a hug?	i'm a girl obviously. but for the don't want kids set....this is the best part of living with a small child. they run to meet you at the door with a hug so excited to see you every day when you come home.	I failed college, by a really small amount.. I felt like such a failure that I almost took my own life..
Girls/Guys who took advice from askmen, what happened? Did it work?	Askmen told me to wait for the guy I liked to make a move on me instead of telling him myself how I felt. So I waited. And shortly thereafter he did. And now we're together. And it's awesome. I mean it probably would have worked out either way, but I'd like to think that Askmen is at least a little responsible haha.	"You worrying and obsessing over her cheating isn't going to stop her from doing it. If she's going to cheat she's going to cheat regardless of how much you obsess." This really helped me get past some issues I have. I was able to let go of my insecurities when she goes out with her friends and just live my life.
I just turned 27, and I feel like I want run away and start over anew; a quarter-life crisis, I suppose. Has this happened to any of you guys? What have you done?	Start playing super smash bros melee competitively, Boston has got a great scene for it. Big tournament to watch this weekend too (CEO).	I'm only 24, but I quit my job, sold my shit, and went overseas about a year ago. What I can tell you for sure is that changing your environment doesn't necessarily change who you are or what's going on in your head. If you've got something in your mind that you need to get figured out, you have to deal with it, changing the scenery isn't just going to make that problem disappear. A lot of people have this fantasy where they run away to a new place and suddenly they're a whole new person. It's just not true. You can go anywhere on earth, you're still just you in that place.
What is wrong with my friendship with women?	You're the emotional dumping ground for your female friends. They come to you to get the emotional attention that they need, and then go to other men to get the sexual attention. I'd hazard a guess that you deal with a lot of their emotional crises instead of their boyfriends, correct? its just human nature. They're maximizing their available resources, as I imagine that every now and again you buy them things or provide other benefits. The reason they're doing it is because you let them, and odds are you no leverage to demand more.	Did you enjoy the musical? Do you enjoy hanging out with these women? If so, why does it matter? Your male friends don't have sex with you (I assume), but you still do what would be labeled "lame shit" with them. Don't take doucher comments so seriously.
Men, how do you feel about a girl who is actually thousands of venomous insects clad in a visage of flesh?	Honestly, can we stop with all the parody posts? I used to enjoy the interesting question and responses, but now the only thing that makes it to the frontpage are these joking posts.	If you can't handle me at my buggiest, you don't deserve me at my fleshiest. Edit. I'm a little high
Gay men of AM, how do you feel browsing this sub?	Gay men are men too. So why should they feel left out. There was a comedian that said that gay men are more man than straight men, because I don't know any straight men that would dare take one up the tailpipe (they probably exist though). Frankly it scares me, so good on you bro's	I don't feel alienated or left out, from what i see on askgaybros a lot of problem are relatable. One thing i find funny is guys saying they don't understand women or that women are too complicated, i feel like it's more general, women and men are complicated. I also like to see how on some topics straight men are really picky while gay dudes doesn't give a shit. For example, sexual partners numbers, it's a recurring issue here while for gays it's pretty rare, most don't care from what i've seen.
What useful YouTube channels are you subbed to and why?	Athlean-X, no bullshit fitness and health info. Like to see some new muscle group workouts to change up the routine every so often.	"Useful" You know what, I have so many damn subs that I watch, I'm just gonna list 'em out with short descriptions. Applied Science- Engineering AvE- working man's engineering Bob Ross- Bob Ross Bosnian Bill- Lockpicking stuff Chop with Chris- Hand tools only woodworking Clickspring- Clockmaking Cody's Lab- chemistry and random stuff Colin Furze- Insane inventions ElectroBOOM- "stupid" engineering Engineer Guy- How things work Every Frame a Painting- Cinematography Frank Howarth- Woodworking Gordon Ramsay- Gordon Ramsay GREENPOWERSCIENCE- Solar power stuff Matthias Wandel- Woodworking Numberphile- neat numbers NurdRage- Chemistry focused Oskar Puzzle- 3d printed puzzles Paul Sellers- Woodworking Primitive Technology- neat old world buildings RegularCars- Regular Car reviews Steve Ramsey- Woodworking Styropro- Lasers and moths The Post Apocalyptic Inventor- similar to AvE Tips From a Shipwright- self explanatory Tom Scott- "things you may not have known" Veritasium- Similar to Tom Scott And that's it I guess.
What are some common advice that women give to men which are actually statistically unlikely to yield positive results?	The ole' "do the laundry and get more sex." You get sex by turning her on, not feminizing yourself or being a doormat.	"You have to stop looking; I promise that the perfect girl with come to you eventually." The promise/guarantee is what makes it so ridiculously absurd
For those of us that never really had nice things, how did you get rid of that feeling of “waiting for the other shoe to drop” when you actually had something nice?	It was a slow, gradual process. When I was a kid I ate gubba'mint cheese and powdered milk. Mom made almost no money (and I think she was bad at personal finance). It took years, some ups and downs, but I got to the point where I realized I saved up for vacations and purchases ahead of time. I have six different whoops/emergency funds. I am going to pay my house off early. I made a great salary. Now and then I'll still find myself doing poor people stuff, tho. Cobbling a ghetto dinner together out of random shit in the fridge because I've mentally calculated the price per meal ... or refusing to buy coffee at home because it's free at work, etc.	The thing is the other shoe is always going to drop. It's not a matter of if it's a matter of when. You need to just take the moment to appreciate things while they're good and not worry about the things that are bad until they happen. Some planning for misfortune is a good thing, but always worrying about it is not. Nothing stays perfect forever. Trying to exercise control over everything never actually works. Just try to appreciate it when things work out because it's temporary. The problems will show up on their own concentrate your efforts on making the good things happen.
What "Real Men" stereotype bothers you the most?	All of them. Don't fucking pigeon hole me. Women would be throwing a shit-fit if I said "Real women _______"	People automatically assume I'm somehow less capable of raising my daughter than my wife is. As a new dad (16 month old baby girl), I HATE being called a babysitter. "Oh, the wife let you babysit?" "How nice of dad to babysit while you go out" No. I'm a parent, and I'm fucking raising my child.
What's the most underrated city you've visited?	Prague, that place is wonderful. Great food, great beer, great people, great sights and it was cheap as heck too.	Detroit downtown has lots of great bars, a wonderful nightlife, tons of boutique shops, and a hockey stadium. But we like to think of it as worse than Baghdad. So I guess that's underrated?
my girlfriend of 10 years died today, what are things to help me cope?	First off, I'm so sorry for your loss. My only input here beyond all of the super helpful things that people have said is to make sure you keep the three essentials going - Diet/Sleep/Exercise. Everything in life is easier to deal with when you have the DSE on lock.	thank you all for your words, i've been up all night im just going to try to stay strong even though it hurts so bad i WISH SO BAD that i had just picked her up from work
What is your unpopular opinion about women?	Because of the constant coddling they get, they never really truly learn right from wrong and treat men like shit and we have to pretend to be ok with it or else be labeled a misogynist. Only respond if you have something better than "b-b-B-B-but sometimes men are bad!" Yeah I know. And they actually face accountability for the shit they do. You will only address female coddling. Just look at all these excuses for shitty female behavior piling up. Exactly as predicted. Fuck it. You idiots won't tolerate accountability for female shit behavior and openly celebrate it while mocking men who fall victim to it and then somehow have the audacity to claim your precious m'ladies aren't like that at all!!!	I dont think they should lower physical requirements for certain jobs to accommodate women who may want to get into the job. The physical requirements should fit what the job entails, and if anyone can't pass it, regardless of gender, that job is not for them.
What is your unpopular opinion about men?	They think that reading a few articles on feminism makes them more of an expert on it than actual literal women.	A lot of men get competitive to the point of it being really petty. Like silly power plays for no reason type stuff.
Men who have worked hard to try and be attractive: Have you noticed a change in how your male friends treat you?	Some kindly told me that a good body won't make up for an ugly face. Mean, but in the end it was what they should have done as friends.	I have a friend who went through this. He's a good looking 6'4 blonde Polish dude. When I go out with him girls would try to talk to me just to get closer to him. On the other hand he seemed incredibly insecure. Constantly talking about how he's awkward in social situations, or his "failure" with girls, etc. At first I just thought, oh maybe he's not that confident. Then he started telling me how he went through a period of time where he would go to parties and hooked up with a lot of girls but ended up being really lonely because every guy saw him as a competition. Then I realized he wasn't insecure, he was just over exposing himself so that his friends can connect with him. So yeah, try being a little overly vulnerable in front of male friends.
What advice do you give to younger men about life/relationships?	Don't get into a serious relationship too early. Save that for your late 20's (at least) and live your life first.	So, you're head over heels for some girl, but she won't give you the time of day? Move on. She's not worth your time, and there will always be someone else.
When did you start really caring about taking care of yourself (ie exercise, supplementation, sleep discipline etc)?	Supplements are by and large complete bullshit. If you eat even a halfway varied diet you are literally just pissing money away because your body will get rid of whatever it doesn't need at the moment. There are only 2 things anyone eating properly will ever need to supplement: Vitamin D and protein. Vitamin D because we're not in the sun as long as we should be and protein only if you are strength training.	When I got to 25 years old with no success with women, I figured that "Just being myself" and "find someone who likes you the way you are" weren't working so it was time to fix my body. Lost 70 lbs, put on some muscle, ride my bike 40 miles a week, eat healthy etc. So now I'm 28 and have no success with women, but at least I look less shit than before.
What's the cringiest moment you have witnessed?	14yo I barely knew because she tried to register to my adult-only class, offered me sex in a back corridor. Her friends and general passerbys were in sight by just popping the head to the angle. Soooooo, how do I minimize the chances I'll be in jail now? Can I salvage some sort of social life?	A guy we partied with as kids started crying one night asking a girl to fuck him. This went on for like an hour until he blacked out. She kept telling him that she just wasn't up for sex that night but had tried to drunkenly make out with several of us before that. Later, I walked in on her fucking the guy my friend brought with him. Bonus cringe-I took a shitty job in my hometown years later and that girl's dad was my boss. He would always introduce me to people telling them I used to hang out with his baby girl.
Overweight men of /AskMen , why haven't you started the process of losing weight? What will push you to do so?	I have, it's difficult, my family is not healthy at all. Very difficult to change things so drastically when everyone surrounding you has very bad habits. It's not as easy as it looks, it really isn't. Stop chalking up everything to "laziness" or people finding excuses (although these people do exist, most people would love to just stay at a healthy weight).	If I had the answer I would no longer be overweight. Or I would at least be working on it. I am not sure what will motivate me to do it, but I do know I should.
My girlfriend cheated on me. What the fuck do I do now?	You know there's a redeeming quality in this. She actually called you the morning after it happened and let you know. She was crying, so there was some semblance of guilt there. We all make mistakes and I don't think she set out to cheat on her bf of 1.5 years when she woke up. If she didn't want to be with you at all, she had a year and a half to end it. All this to say, we're all shitty sometimes and people make mistakes. At least she had the decency to tell you upfront.	Settle into a new single guy routine until you're ready for another relationship. Take this relationship and its demise as a life lesson, but don't carry trust issues into a new relationship and make a new woman pay for your exes mistake.
How many of you don't drink alcohol?	I hate alcohol. It's fucking terrible. It's so bad that I'm pretty sure everyone who drinks is doing it just to fuck with me. Edit: Getting downvoted for not liking my drinks to taste like gasoline in a thread asking about not drinking, yeah that makes sense. Oh well	i'm 25 and haven't drank in three years. i used to drink and party a lot but grew out of it after living with guys who were functioning alcoholics. people are pretty judgemental about it, they either think you are some kind of pussy or a recovering alcoholic.
Farted too loud. What are the dumbest fights you've gotten into with your S/O?	Uh. Black people get preferential treatment getting into college. I'm not black. She's not black. Actually, neither of us are white. What the fuck?!	My ex went nuts because I wanted to sleep on the left side of the bed...in my own house. She literally had a temper tantrum and threatened to sleep on the couch or go home. We are no longer together.
How many of you guys like lounging about in just your underwear?	Like you...my belly isn't flat and my thighs tend to touch. But I'm comfortable with myself...not HAPPY with it, but accepting. As far as the tighty whities...meh, just what I wore today. I have better stuff from 2Xist and Jockey...but I also appreciate the basics.	Unless I have company over, I'm almost exclusively in my underwear. The only drawback is no pocket to toss my phone into when I walk around the house.
men who got married because of a pregnancy/child birth, what's your story?	Got spermjacked at 21. Married. Spent my early twenties working two jobs, raising a child on my own, and horribly depressed. Dumped the dead-weight wife, did the single dad thing. Got remarried five years later, turns out that I can't pick them well, had a second child, dumped the second wife, now a single dad again. Never getting married again, there isn't a woman alive worth marriage anymore	My dad had a one night stand with my mom at Myrtle Beach at sixteen, that resulted in my older brother. They got married, finished high school, worked hard and made a life. Because of poor sex education at nineteen they had me. Over the course of the next ten years my dad put himself through night school at a local University and my mom started a business. when I hit teenaged they got empty nest syndrome and tried for a girl but got a pair of twins. I'd be lying if I said their marriage was perfect, but growing up I never knew how hard we sometimes had it. My parents are my heroes, and they love each other and their family very much.
To the guys who can maintain a platonic interesting relationship with an attractive female without wanting to go past that, how do you do it?	If a dude finds her attractive he probably would bang her if given the chance. If he says he wouldn't he probably just means he couldn't. And you're not hiding your intentions, you're controlling your impulses as an adult. If you enjoy someone's friendship and don't have emotional attachment you can chill with them like anyone else. It's no different than not raging on everyone who makes you mad or not letting your friend know that his 4,000 "1 like = 1 Jesus" FB shares make you want to castrate him. Self control.	Because you value the similar qualities in them that you do your male mates. You can still find them attractive, but it doesn't mean you desire them. What you describe isn't friendship, its just you meeting someone new and falling for them in some way. I Suggest rather then getting to the "Barking dog" stage you just be confident and tell them what you want.... in a slightly more respectful way then you describe here.
What are the pros and cons of owning your own home? Which do you prefer and why?	Think about this: Every homeowner will die having thousands of dollars to their name that was spent on the house from down payments, taxes, repairs, etc. When you're on your death bed imagine there is a giant stack of tens of thousands of dollars getting set on fire that you never used. I would rather rent an amazing house I could never afford to buy and spend the down payment on traveling the world and dying having spent all of my money on adventures across the globe.	The best thing about it for me has been getting away from all the scuzz in my old apartment complex. My house is fairly isolated and very quiet. I can actually get to sleep before midnight. Having a garage and extra space is nice, too. Obviously there's more work involved in owning a home. You have to maintain stuff and be around for maintenance, that sort of thing. I feel like it's worth it.
How many guys have gotten in an actual fight with a guy because he was messing with your girlfriend?	This is a weird question. ”how many”implies you want to know how common it is, but there's no way a bunch of discrete internet answers could demonstrate that.	Once almost, but she started it with this group of guys. She was taking a lot of pictures in one spot so they started snickering at her, so she turns around to them and tells them the pics are not of them so mind their own business. So they mock her going "oooohh scary" so I just say ignore them lets go. Then she gets mad at ME saying why didn't I do anything? I was fucking astounded at the lack of thinking she was using, I was going to fight at least 5 dudes and probably get the shit kicked out of me over pictures. It was stupid selfish shit like that led me to breakup with her later on.
What are your relationship dealbreakers?	Drugs, smoking, alcoholism. Racist or misogynist. Not an adventurous eater. Incompatible sense of humor. Hates travel. Isn't self sufficient. Is egregiously messy or dirty. Identifies as a gamer. Owns gun(s). Doesn't want a kid and/or is unwilling to go through the processes that are necessary for me to conceive. Dislikes my dog. Excessive body hair / a beard. Edit to add: Little boys who can't handle someone's preferences not including them.	Any type of cheating, argumentative personality, and not being able to communicate. My ex would explode on me if I ever said something was bothering me and I would always be the one saying sorry.
For those of you who have paid for sex in the past, how did your current SO react when you told her?	You know, with the number of men on here who post that women should state their number of previous partners honestly in case it's a dealbreaker, I'm pretty appalled at everyone who is now saying "don't tell her you saw a hooker, she'll break up with you." Such hypocrisy.	Since a ton of you say not to tell her, what would you do if she explicitly asked after you two had become somewhat serious? "Hey I was wondering where you stand on prostitution? Have your ever paid for sex?" Do you lie? Tell the truth? Ask them if they really want to know? Refuse to answer the question?
Men of Reddit who have put a dog to sleep, my dog has to be put to sleep. What do I do?	>Is it normal to cry? It's *your dog*. If you don't cry, you're a robot. There's really nothing that makes it easier. Don't leave his side until he's gone.	One thing you don't do is leave your dog when it's happening, if you do, he'll be spending his last moments looking for you. Be there with him the whole time, and don't be shy to tell him you love him and cry if you have to. Dogs are a wonderful blessing that we have in life and they are ridiculously loyal and loving to us. It isn't going to be easy, but make sure that you give him the best two days you possibly can. Stay strong dude.
What made you realize life was not fair?	When I came to the realization that I was so beautiful and sexy while everyone else was just so uggo. Life just ain't fair.	Moving to a poor city and attending public school. The other kids were blown away by things I took for granted.
Those of you with a 9-5 job, how do you find time in your day to relax/pursue other hobbies?	I and plenty of people work 40+ hours a week and find time for everything. Reading your post you sound kinda whiny. Did you expect adulthood to involve not having to work? People make time for what is important or they make excuses not to.	You might want to try not making so many stops. For me it's real nice to get up, hit the gym with a bag of work clothes, and go straight to work. Going to one, coming home, going to the gym, coming back and then getting on with the night would probably add about an hour of driving
When you watch porn, are you getting off on the idea of the situation happening to you or is the fact that it is happening before your eyes?	People just watch porn cause it's probably the closest to being with a girl you can get, so it's easy stimulation. Not really any deep meaning behind the fact it's easy and the closest thing to real you can get. Any guy who watches porn should know shit is just bad for you, women too probably. It's over the top stimulation that can just become dull over-time. For women it probably doesn't matter because they don't need to get an erection like guy do, but there's a reason young guys get ED and porn doesn't help that	The former. I always imagine myself in the porn that I watch. I think this is the main reason that I don't enjoy lesbian porn.
Approached by a female coworker asking if I was free Saturday evening and I don't want to meet up, except I've already said okay. What is the best excuse to get out of it?	Re: edit #1. No, you don't need excuses. Get off the couch. Honor your commitments. Don't be shitty. Go interact with people.	> EDIT2: I have a girlfriend and it just hasn't come up in conversation. This German coworker is only here for a few months, and she has a boyfriend in Germany. I really need a good excuse to get out of it and not look like I'm slingin dick. Say you're sorry to cancel with such short notice but your GF surprised you with dinner reservations for Saturday Or, you know, you could just tell the truth
Men, what things do you do to "treat" yourself?	My version of treating myself is the time that I get to spend at the hunt camp each fall/winter. No wife, no kids, no world. Just me, usually a couple buddies, and the outdoors... and a LOT to drink.	Treated myself yesterday. One hundred percent me day. Slept in, watched Netflix in bed for a bit while playing Starbound. Got up, played some Killing Floor 2 with friends. Went out to the bar that serves some great food for dinner, enjoyed it. Left the bar, went to a movie. Came home, showered, crashed into bed with the doggos.
How's your new relationship working out, guys?	It's okay. We get along really well. She's not nearly as good looking as past gfs however. I'm hoping it's not a problem later...	Not sure if this counts as new. Me and my high school sweetheart got back together back in April after not seeing each other for almost 4 years but we dated all of high school. It's absolutely amazing. I was head over heels in love with her and never got over her. We both didn't date anyone in college because we both loved each other too much. It's so nice to be in her life and everything feels right again.
Men who are happy with their significant others, what is a flaw of your partner and why is it not a deal breaker in the end?	Kitten is very sadistic and cruel towards people, in an almost casual sort of way. She's the sort of chick who you'll tell you're going into surgery, and she'll mention that some people just don't wake up from anesthesia, or that some people are awake and alert throughout the surgery, feeling everything but unable to move, and isn't that terrible? She's a woman always ready with the needle, to poke and prod and twist it in the flesh of the helpless and the down trodden. This isn't a deal breaker to me because i'm the exact same way, and we make a good team.	Mine repeated every single line that was said of a conversation if she's telling a story, that shit fries me
What attracted you to a woman that caught you off guard?	Her small frame. I'd like to have an experience with a girl that I can actually use to jerk off with instead of to.	If you like/know other languages hearing someone talk in their native tongue knocks my socks off. Also hearing them speak with an accent is really sexy as well.
Would you prefer a nuclear war or zombie post-apocalypse situation? Why?	Zombies. Wait is my family immune. Well were all fucked either way. Zombies I guess. Zombie tits. That's not incest. I mean necrophilia rite?	I'm going with zombies. With a nuclear apocalypse, the water supply is fucked and you have radiation everywhere so you have to wear a hazmat suit and deal with the possibility of your offspring being born with 6 limbs and 3 eyes. With zombies, you just have to stay away from/kill the zombies and hope you don't get bitten.
What is the biggest lie you've told?	"I love you." No, I don't...I have never loved you, and I will never love you. You are prejudiced, willfully ignorant, human trash. The world is sullied with your presence, and it will be cleansed of great evil when you die.	One night in my teens, I came home super stoned after smoking weed with some buddies. Parents are awake, see my eyes and start yelling at me since they're super anti-anything drug related. I wasn't too popular with the ladies at the time, so in the moment I tell them I was crying because I got shot down by a girl. Man did that shit work. They immediately begin to apologize, and I'm off the hook. The next morning my dad apologizes and hugs me over breakfast saying he's sorry, and my older brother who knew what was up gave me this look that screamed "You sneaky bastard."
Men who have cheated but were never caught or confessed during the relationship, what are your thoughts and feelings on your infidelity now?	I cheated on my wife and sorry to say but it was pretty great! It was with a coworker in a parked car once every two weeks or so. The anticipation was amazing, made me feel like a teenager again! Once things got normal, we called it quits and I went back to my loving wife! Wins all around!	I cheated on my ex a few times. The guilt you feel really eats you up, to be honest. You know you're a bastard for doing it. I regret doing it, I should have broken up with her sooner, and did my own thing. I don't recommend it.
How many of you guys struggle with loneliness and how do you cope with it?	Well... First I remember I am a man. Then I stop being a little bitch. Step 1. Identify the problem Step 2. Investigate causes Step 3. Formulate a plan and action it Step 4. Review, refine and repeat. If your "friend" walks around thinking like a little bitch people will not want him in their life. Use the steps above. Get out of the comfort zone and then you will stop being a little bitch.	I don't, honestly. I usually have no problem being lonely, it's just when I'm being reminded of my loneliness that it starts to hurt. But it happens infrequently enough for me to not have a way of coping with it.
How do you feel about girls who have had threesomes in the past, or been otherwise sexually adventurous?	I'm a woman but I've had this same conversation with my boyfriend and with several male friends and not one of them said that it made any difference to them whatsoever. Sounds like the same kind of guy who would say that if a woman has been with X number of guys she's no longer "girlfriend material". Very immature and insecure.	If you're sexually adventurous, then don't get all prudish because you want a serious relationship. Finding that kind of shit out will make anyone think "what's wrong with me that they don't want to explore sex with *me*?!" and that may turn to "those desires just didn't go away, so either I'm so repulsive that she can't have fun sex with me, or she's having fun sex with someone else" and thus kill that relationship. So, if you're sexually adventurous, then find someone else who is sexually adventurous and have lots of babies in a very freaky way. (Or don't have babies and just have freaky sex.)
What do you guys feel about sperm donation?	Don't do it. Never do it. The day will come when some woman or kid identifies you and then your life is ruined. Pay up! No, the law doesn't matter. The law may state that you're safe, but judges always *put the kid's interest first* which means if somebody thinks you should pay for the kid, *you will pay for the kid*.	It bums me out because I'm forbidden from donating sperm. I'm not tall enough. Eugenics at work I guess. I'd do it if I could. Easy money and I wouldn't have some hang up knowing that I have genetic progeny walking around. In fact It'd be perfect since as of now, I don't want to have kids, but the main thing that bothers me about that is my lack of legacy and ending my bloodline which goes back as long as humanity has been around. I wouldn't have to worry about that anymore.
For frat members - Are initiations in frats as crazy as they seem on tv? What was your initiation or the craziest one you know of?	It wasn't all that bad. I just had to suck a few dicks, and there was this one thing where everyone had a competition to see who could land a quarter in butthole, other than that though...not bad at all.	I got initiated in 2011 and live in the west coast. The shit we did during the semester leading up to what is known as "hell week" isn't bad. Since we can decide to leave at any point, they usually don't make you do anything TOO crazy before hell week. I got initiated with 22 other guys, and one of them tried to quit during hell week but at that point you've seen the worst of the worst so they don't really allow you to leave until you become initiated. As far as drinking goes, it's not forced but it's definitely encouraged. I've heard some stories of other fraternities and to my knowledge, frats in the south are on a whole different playing field when it comes to hazing.
Have you ever been in a group situation where something you thought was normal gets questioned by everyone and you question everything you thought you knew?	I remember playing Mortal Kombat on a friend's Xbox when I was around 14/15. He had another friend over at the time who I hadn't met before. Anyway, there's this fatality move that Scorpion does where he uses his chains to grab the game's camera and pull it towards himself. I thought that was an amazing effect at the time and commented on how I liked the way they used the game camera like that. The other guy looks at me as though I've said the strangest thing ever and chuckles to himself while saying "haha, he calls it a camera." My friend and I just looked at him, and then we looked at each other and said "that's what we've always called it."	I was helping to make cookies from scratch with a gf once. When she started placing scoops on the baking tray I stopped her and said "What about the milk?" She just stared at me... "When I was young my mom always made cookies and milk was always an ingredient...." More staring.... Then she gingerly responds: "Babe, those cookies came from a box. The only time one adds milk to cookie mix is when the cookies are powdered....in a box. You've told me your mom was a terrible cook. Did you think she was a better baker?" My world was shattered.
What makes sex go from good to amazing for you?	When I feel like I don't have a shitton of pressure on me. Sex is too often like having an exam you didn't study for. All stress and nerves. Two reasons for that. 1- I'm responsible for my own satisfaction And 2- I'm responsible for her satisfaction. What her job is I have no idea, most of them seem to think showing up is sufficient. If I get time and opportunity to actually enjoy the act I'm in amazing territory.	When I can tell the noises she's making are more involuntary rather than "we're having sex so these are the noises I will make to keep him informed that I am enjoying myself", if that makes sense. When I can feel her quiver.
What is the most fucked up thing you witnessed lately?	A friend of mine is so desperate to be with someone, that she's okay with alcoholics who have tempers, choke her, beat her, deny her from leaving the house. It makes me ill whenever I hear about a new abuse. Yet she doesn't fix things. Or tighten up her criteria a bit. Like no alcohol, for example. Almost all of this happens when the guy is drunk. I don't get it. The pattern is there. She has kids to think about. If she gets really hurt by one of these guys, or even worse, killed? What the fuck is gonna happen to them then?	Was walking my dog through the park and saw that there were about fifteen police officers there. Out of curiosity I walked by a saw a body bag on the floor and was told by an officer that an 18 year old kid had hung himself from a tree.
What do you wish your SO had told you *before* moving in together?	I wish she would have said: "Oh, BTW...you aren't allowed to have a personal opinion and everything you say will be met with either criticism, disbelief or outright opposition. Sex will be controlled by me and when I don't get I want, I'll show you that I'm angry for 2 or 3 days but actually hold my grudge for the rest of my life." Side note: DON'T GET MARRIED GUYS! (And by guys I mean MEN).	"By the way hun, I don't actually use the alarm clock to wake up, I just press the snooze button over and over again until it's five minutes before I have to be out the door."
Those of you who picked the wrong career (for you), when did you realize you weren't on the right track?	I started working on arts during high school, hated it and switched next year. Now I wanna be a software engineer :]	I was a grocery store manager and was facing the reality that I was just a number to the company as opposed to an asset. That's how I treated my employees and was naïve to think that was how the company was supposed to treat me. Then one morning I go in to work and ended up watching 9/11 happen live on the TV in the office. I talked to an Army recruiter that week and put in my notice. After 15 years of loyalty the company didn’t try once to get me to stay. Not even an exit interview. I’m still in the Army. It has its ups and downs but my worst day in Iraq was still better than my best day working for them.
How do I let my former male coworker know I didn't mean to reject his advances completely?	How drunk was he? Might be something to watch with him. Not saying either way, but that's pretty forward when you were drunk.	Here's an idea. If you want to be with him, just let him know you are interested and move forward. If you don't want to be with him, leave it alone. Honesty and directness, go figure.
What is your opinion of women who say they would leave their boyfriend if he doesn't propose within a certain amount of time?	I think they're idiotic. I think anyone who makes any major relationship decision around a time requirement is dumb and I would not date them. It raises what is probably the biggest red flag to me: She doesn't actually want to be with *me*, and just wants to be with *someone*. Also that she is incredibly driven by societal 'norms'.	I mean, if marriage is part of your long term plan, I get it. You don't waste time with people you're incompatible with in the long term. But I'd hope there'd be a discussion about your plans for the future and if and when marriage would be a thing, rather than an arbitrary deadline.
Men who are frequently rejected by women: how do you stay confident? What helps you continue to approach other women after you've been rejected over and over again?	Only approach women who are out of your league and you expect rejection from. **NEVER** approach women who are beneath you and risk rejection from them. Think about it. If you apply for a job as CEO of a major corporation and get rejected, who cares? It's what was expected. But when you apply for a job working the front line at the local car wash and get rejected, that hurts! How fucking awful are you that the goddamn carwash won't even hire you?	Take honest stock of what you actually have to offer. If it's good, then keep going. If not, work on improving yourself. And understand that dating isn't a war zone. It's an audition. Just because you're not right for the part doesn't mean you're bad. Edward Norton is a hell of an actor, but you wouldn't cast him as the lead in a Martin Luther King Jr. biopic.
Has your SO ever tried to set you up to catch you cheating? What happened and did you stay with her?	I passed her "shit test" and dumped her for the girl she tried to get me to cheat on her with. Poetic justice. AND, since girl2 willingly participated I already knew she was a crappy person, but she was really hot so I had as much sex with her as possible until I couldn't stand her Machiavellian BS any longer.	Once, a girl I dated came up to me with an earring. "Who does this belong to?" "I have no idea" "Don't lie to me!" I racked my brain to think of who it could belong to. All my female friends lived in other cities at the time and my friends weren't dating anyone at the time so there had literally been no other girls in my apartment for probably months. Wait, maybe it was that girlfriend of a friend of a friend that came in here as part of that large group? That was only for 15 minutes, but still... "Well?" "Sorry, I have no idea" "I'm just kidding, it's my earring, I just wanted to see how you'd react"
For people that are shy when starting a conversation with a woman, how do you overcome this to make the opening interaction?	Practice on people you aren't interested in just to get used to talking to females. No problem if you "mess up" since you aren't trying to impress them anyways, it just helps you get over your anxiety.	I used to be much more shy and afraid to start conversations with girls than I am now but I always had a bigger fear of wondering "what if I didn't talk to her?" That drove me to giving it a shot and it usually turned out well. Sometimes didn't work out the best but rarely, if at all, ended horribly.
What are your biggest pet peeves at work?	Noisy people and people that gossip. I guess when you're privileged and raised in white neighborhoods it's the norm to get involved in situations that you have no business being involved in. I ask a person out discreetly and made a mistake posting something on social media , then half the office knows. Worse part is when people you don't even know or communicated with is giving you dirty looks but you can't say nothing or approach them because you're in a professional environment. I always shutdown any gossiping that people bring me into on the spot. I've seen too much people get dragged into unfortunate situations because they're involved in something they have no business being involved with from the jump.	This one drives me insane. I missed the last meeting, so if we can just rehash everything we did in that meeting while I object noncommittally to every point that was agreed upon without offering alternatives, that'd be greeeaaaaat.
How do I lower my sex drive?	Stop watching porn and stop masturbating as much as possible. It'll be really hard at first, but as you ejaculate less, your body will respond by producing less semen, and your urges will become less frequent. Get yourself to a point where you can go 3-4 days before you need to release (the operative word being need). And, yeah, I think not feeling crazy for sex every single day probably will have an overall positive effect on your life. That said, every two weeks is not much...	Truth is that this could be a deal breaker. Can you imagine spending the next 5 years getting it twice a month? She's on the lower end of the spectrum. I think younger couples have sex at a minimum of 3 to 4 times per week. I don't want to sound callous but having libidos that match really is important in a relationship.
Men of color on Askmen that have lived in different states and regions of the USA before, how much of an impact has location had on your dating life and how women perceive you?	Irregardless of color this is a true theory. It's playing into the demographics of your area. A prime example me! I'm a cityboy through and through and now live in Upstate NY, I'm either perceived as a full of himself cityboy because I like to dress nice with good fitting clothing (rare here), I'm perceived really good looking and come off intimidating to those who have an interest in me because I don't fit the status quo of the area, or I'm just completely viewed as completely neutral and odd for not dressing country like.	I'm part white, Chinese, native South American, and black, but most people consider me Chinese /filipino. I grew up in the Midwest. I could pretty much only date the few girls who were into Asian guys (it's worth mentioning that east and south Asian men are seen as the least attractive in America). Being lower middle class and atheist hurt my chances as well. I'm now in California. When I lived in SF I actually felt attractive, having women hit on me, get handsy, etc. There, I was taller than average and people thought I was exotic because of certain aspects of my background. I also have had pretty good success with hook ups when I travel to big cities without really trying. Basically, if you have a racial handicap when it comes to dating, moving to one of the larger metro areas is your best bet.
Age gap relationships. How many years is too much ?	If they're legal, you can date whoever you want. If you like elderly women and they like you, more power to you. More young women for me.	My wife is ten years older than me. We're married over 20 years. So it can work well but based on my experience I can say it's going to require a lot of tolerance on her part. And you will have to dial back your expectations back sexually, once she gets to The Change sex frequency falls off quite a bit.
What is scarier; the existence of aliens, or the inexistence of aliens?	Hardly matters either way. If other life forms exist, we'll never see them. If they don't, we'll never know. Distances are too vast, physics is physics. In a hundred years earth will be a wasteland w/o the resources to support an advanced technological society, so we ain't going even to Mars, much less outside the solar system.	"Scarier"? I'd say the existence of aliens, The inexistence is more of an existential fear, but not a real threat. Whereas life on other planets is a series of unknowns that could be potential threats. But I do think the inexistence of aliens would be a lot sadder.
20, got a girlfriend for a first time. Tips for being a decent boyfriend?	To save yourself a lot of time try not to use logic or reason during arguments but just explain how you feel about it. After learning about this I honestly felt like I had cracked Enigma. All of the sudden my fights shortened by a lot and they lasted maybe 15 minutes and I was hearing the other person apologize. Here's the thing about feelings you can't argue against them, if I feel like you're being unfair about something you can't provide a counter argument because mine is just based on emotion. I noticed this is what girls do in a lot of arguments so I just mimicked it, it has since saved me a lot of headache and strangely enough the issues actually got resolved vs when I tried to use reason which just turned things into a bigger cluster fuck.	You're already trying to be a decent boyfriend, which in itself is a good sign that you are going to do alright. Just pay attention to details, communicate, and listen to her, and you should be golden. Be wary that she doesn't take advantage of you though! It is all too easy for that to happen, and they don't say "love is blind" for no reason.
Do you believe you are desirable to the opposite sex? Why or why not?	So far...no. I don't know. Maybe girls are scared my colour, maybe I'm genuinely unattractive to them. I don't maintain a whole lot of facial hair, but perhaps with the tiny amount I do, maybe they find that unsettling. Once they find out I'm British Indian, the second part probably scares them off. The worst part is... I genuinely don't know how to take steps to improve on this, or know what it is that makes me so undesirable to girls out there where I live. So I have no idea what to do. I'm only 17 and already I have no hope in getting a girlfriend. Fun times.	Of course I am attractive. Age 72 Heartbeat: present, variable Comedic quotient: High Handyman skills: Comprehensive Can dance, play bridge, name several operas, drive a tractor, car, motorcycle, boat, but not an airplane. Still have all my teeth, and am smarter than the average bear. (Average bears are prety dumb though.)
What female name is an instant turnon for you?	Why do you have to say female? Christ guys can like dudes too and shouldn't be purposefully excluded from every other thread. Ya know what fuck it. Cody.	I'm secretly hoping all the women who see this headline are in here just to ctrl+f their names and I'm not the only one because that would make me feel weird. Like caring what Disney Princess I am on the latest facebook quiz.
Men of Reddit - How often do you receive compliments from your SO/women in general? And what might those compliments be? Does this affect you in any way?	I get being cute a lot, I like it for sure, but I want to be the hot guy! Cute is for puppies :P	My wife and I have been together for 11-ish years. Last night she said I was hilarious, and it's the first time I can remember her genuinely complimenting me in a long, long time. It made me feel better than I'd care to admit.
What day do you consider to be the worst in your entire life?	An amalgamation of multiple days in Alaska. My memory of my time there is a bit screwy so I don't necessarily know what bad shit happened on different days.	The day I snooped through my ex wife's phone and found out that she was cheating on me with her crossfit friend. Then confronting her about it and her telling me that she loves him.
Ladies who checkout r/askmen. How do you feel about most of the posts about guys being insecure?	It validated what I learned far too late in life and helped me treat the men in my life with more care. I honestly didn't really know anything about the "fragile male ego" until almost my 30s and instead held onto this concept of the John Wayne type of man. (Perhaps influenced by a father who loves me deeply but in that John Wayne type of way.) So I am thankful for the insight, because it has inspired me to take better care of the men in my life, to offer non-judgmental space, to compliment them often and sincerely and to be a better friend. So I am grateful.	It's kind of refreshing to see that everyone has insecurities. I was really close to my brother growing up so my perception of men didn't change too much; I already knew they have insecurities just like everyone else.
She's otherwise the perfect woman, and she cares about you.. but she's heavily overweight. What are your reactions?	How is she going to take care of my needs and my children if she can't even take care of herself. Sound far from perfect to me	Sounds like we'd be great friends. It's not fair to anyone if I enter into a relationship with someone I'm not attracted to. Eventually, one of three things would happen: - She'd lose the weight, opening the way for a relationship. - My attraction would grow to the point that I stopped caring as much about the weight. - We'd move on.
Men who will forever be the "Asshole ex" to one or more of your exes, what happened and how does it feel to be remembered in that way?	I don't think there are many people that would think I was the asshole if they knew the whole story. I think I was very kind and generous and I feel like I made every effort to try and show her that I was the person that she could be with forever. In the end, I feel like she needed me to be the asshole so I will wear that mantle for her. I still love her, but the feels fade more and more everyday. I guess that's the way things work though right?	I was too much of a pussy, should have ended things 6 months before I did. She was head over heels in love with me and I wasn't with her. Created a lot of resentment and pointless arguments
I've had primary custody of my 15 year old son for 3 years. He called me today, to tell me he wanted to try living with his mom for a semester. Can someone please tell me how to feel, or what to do?	Sounds like momma wants your money, so she carefully explained all the benefits he would get if he lived with her. Let that run its course, because he will eventually find out the truth.	I think the biggest thing here is not to take it as a rejection. If he's been living with you for a while now, maybe he just wants to spend some time with his mom, especially since he said it was only for a semester.
Guys who "ghost" girls after seemingly hitting it off, why do you do it?	Seriously???!!!! A girl is asking this question about how 'guys ghost?!' SERIOUSLY???? Being flaky and ghosting is every girl's middle-name, and I bet all of your friends would (probably) be masters of that game too. Ask them the reason(s) why they ghost/flake, and those would be similar to the ones many guys have to do the same.	We didn't hit it off as well as she thinks. If I'm with a girl and concluded that I'm not into her I'll often prod her and ask her lots of questions and followups about herself and she'll enjoy talking about herself. Most people do. I do it to get through the awkwardness and keep the conversation going, but usually I've checked out and its a low effort way to make it through the night. People love talking about themselves though, so after getting her to talk about herself all night they tend to walk way thinking it went well. I'll generally end it with a "I'm not that into you" before I head home, but a lot of people find it easier to say nothing than deliver the bad news in person.
My girlfriend just said "I'm obsessed with your face" what are some of the weirdest compliments you've received?	That i have nice calves. I have no tattoos and thats where i wanted to put my first tattoo partially because of the compliment. But she doesn't want me to get one there. Women are baffling.	"I really like the way your hair is dark in the middle" My 8 year old nephew reminding me that I needed to do my roots.
How long would you date a girl before asking her to be your girlfriend?	What I want to figure out. Is why you call it dating if you aren't bf and gf? Because at that point that's not dating. That's called being friends.	Depends where you are I'm guessing. I'm here in Ireland, and after the first date, if it goes well, you'll find yourself just spending days with them and then you realize you're totally in a relationship. Of course I may be speaking from minority, I truly don't know, but from what I've seen, the whole multiple dates to judge a person thing, seems to be a US setup.
What do you prefer and why - condo or house living?	HOA's are the worst. Buy a house. Plus new construction is shit in comparison to a good solid house that was built in the mid 20th century.	House. Condo is just a glorified apartment, and you often have association fees. I like being responsible for my living area, not everyone else's.
You guys that piss all over the toilet seat, all over the floor and dont flush; What the fuck is your problem?	Only will do this if the bathroom stall is absolutely disgusting in the first place. I will ensure that if a place makes an effort to keep their toilets clean, I will clean up.If the toilet is, well, a gas station, I'm not going near that shit (literally)	The one that confounds me is the giant turds left unflushed in the bowl. "I'm so proud of this one I just can't send it down *sniffles*"
What's a secret you're keeping that could destroy a relationship?	That my dad is a loser and a failure. I think he already knows this, but he has to at least feel like his son thinks something of him. If I told him how I truly felt, he would probably kill himself. I'm not sure that would be a bad thing.	The older I get, the more I realize that my mom is not the shining person I idolized in my youth. She's scared of anything outside her bubble, closed minded, and stuck in the past. She'd be crushed if she knew. Edit: As I read replies this morning I'm re-qualifying what I've said here. She's still a good person at heart and, even though she'd be incredibly sad to hear my original response, she'd probably have some wisdom for me along the lines of 'you're still growing up no matter how old you are' and what I saw then vs now.
Guys who have had their SO fall out of love with them. What happened? How did she tell you?	I immediately realized I'd picked a coward unable to communicate properly who gave in to the pressure of other people, and anything I'd ever felt for her died. And yeah I'd made mistakes that helped kick it all off going to shit but she sure as hell didn't make talking to her easy. I firmly believe one day, even if it's not until she's old and grey, she'll look back and shed a tear for what could have been. As for me, I've learnt to trust my gut, and won't make the same mistakes again.	I got too fat. Totally reasonable. I *had* gotten too fat. I was always a bit on the heavy side, and she still loved me as I was gaining weight and that's amazing to me, because when I look back on pictures of me... holy hell. Anyway, at a certain point, it was just too much. She tried to play it off as other issues when we were breaking up, but she eventually fessed up. I don't recall even being mad that was the reason. It was just... Yep. I'm fat. I've lost a lot of weight since then and even joined the Army. My life's headed in the right direction and that will never be a problem for me again. Everybody has a right to their preference, and I can't fault her or anyone else in my future for it.
Do you hide your attraction for women? Why?	No, not unless there is a very good reason to hide them (say, your girlfriend is extremely jealous or the person you're attracted to is your boss). I think being attracted to somebody is a wonderful feeling. I don't hide attraction but I also don't have to force myself upon a woman. Nature made it so I can't help but look at women I am attracted to and they will eventually notice. I try not to be creepy or freak them out. I just enjoy in silence. Any female friends I am attracted to, I will tell so in the right moment (when I know that she won't take it the wrong way). That doesn't mean I am actively trying to get into their pants. It just means that in a different world, if they wanted it too, we might actually explore it.	Always, I honestly have no idea how I'm even supposed to show my attraction to someone in a way that's not creepy or awkward.
Married men of askmen, how far into the relationship were you sure she/he was the one?	Three months, well that's when we found out she was 5 weeks pregnant...married for a rollercoaster year. Two years later and the divorce still isn't finalized.	I knew after the first date that my first wife was the one. That marriage lasted 20 years, and was only cut short by her death due to cancer. I remarried. I knew after a week. We got married this past March. I'm never letting her go.
Men who simply don't enjoy watching sports, why? Ever feel like you're missing out?	Because I have absolutely no investment in any kind of sports game. I have no reason to care that some team that happens to be based near me won a game against some team that lives farther away. I don't enjoy playing sports, so I don't get anything out of seeing the games played well. Etc. Etc. Realistically, it's the people who like sports who have something to explain.	I'm one of those guys. I see sports as a bunch of guys who I don't know playing a game that doesn't affect me. I really have no reason to get emotionally invested. I imagine you'd get the same feeling about watching something like a South Korean high school ping pong tournament. The actual experience of watching sports doesn't appeal to me, but the one thing I do feel like I'm missing out on is the ability to walk up to any guy in my city, make a comment about one of the local teams, and have an instant connection.
What do you feel so passionate about that you tend to end up arguing over?	Incest. It pisses me off to no end that people have a problem with it. People say it's bad because of... 1. birth defects, because apparently natural birth is mandatory in all sexual relationships. Try telling that to a gay person. 2. the fact that incestuous sex often involves minors. Kind of like how every gay priest fucks little boys, right? 3. the "ew" factor. Because if you don't want to fuck your cousin, it's wrong for anyone to. Kind like how being gay is wrong because I don't want to fuck another dude, right? I firmly believe that anyone who thinks homosexuality is fine but incest is wrong has zero critical thinking skills and simply blindly internalizes whatever the liberal media tells them.Two consenting adults should be allowed to have sex in fucking 2016. Period. I will literally fight you over this.	Any time people quote some pop psych book, article in a mainstream news magazine that poorly summarizes a published journal article or worse the musings of some blogger with 5 credits of undergrad psych, and start talking as an expert on behavior/neurology/the human condition, I have to remind myself to just bite my tongue and walk away. Especially on forums like reddit, people don't actually want to learn and see the prevalent models and theories used by mainstream psychology, psychiatry, and neurology... they just want to cherry pick interpretations of further cherry picked sub-results to further their agendas. They feel this is a-ok because psychology, medicine and biology aren't real science anyway. Don't even get me started on when people use a single correlation buried in a table of exploratory stats and start saying "see science proves x causes y!!!".
What kind of shoes do you guys wear?	Asics. See, most companies have an aversion to calling any of their customers fat. Fatties are a bigger market than people with wide feet. Fat feet and wide feet are very different shapes. So most shoe companies' "wide" shoes are really fat shoes. Asics is the exception.	Adidas ultraboosts, for when I know I'm going to be walking a lot. Otherwise I stick to white casual sneakers, like Stan smiths, Nike killshot 2, chucks etc.
What's your view on your SO having an opposite gender best friend?	Depends about that guy. There is so many factors that its hard to judge. If he would be better looking than me, smarter, richer etc, then Houston we have a problem. I am not really tolerant person.	I have a question in addition to this one - does it matter how long they have been best friends? I have a male best friend but we've been friends since 7 years old, so it's not like he became my friend in order to get me into bed.
What notion about yourself would you like to dispell?	I'm not sexist because I act in a manner to which women respond well; and am subsequently successful with them. I didn't make the rules.	Let’s dispel once and for all with this fiction that I don’t know what I'm doing. I know exactly what I'm doing.
Girlfriend hates some of my friends. How do I help this situation?	I'm going to withhold my advice due to bias, because "doesn't get along with my friends" falls under the deal breaker category for me.	Its perfectly reasonable for her not to want to hang out with some of your friends. Its often a red flag if she is trying to pressure you not to hang out with your friends. On your end, you should be conscious of how much quality time you are spending with them vs her. By "quality time", I mean something more than sitting down and watching Netflix after work. How much time do you spend climbing with your friends, vs going places and doing things with her?
Guys who pee on the seat of the office toilet and then don't clean it up, therefore creating a situation where someone else literally has to clean up your piss. What was the moment in your life that made you into the failure you've become?	Probably in Jr High. My question to the ladies is why do you get mad at the man for leaving the seat up, because you sit on the toilet at night? I would think it's your responsibility to make sure you don't sit in something gross. If I have to lift up the seat, I don't think it's asking too much not to be blamed because you didn't look where you're sitting.	I am a large person--about 6'4". If there is no urinal in the vicinity, and I am forced to use a toilet to pee--I sit the fuck down. My height, combined with (let's call it) "water pressure" results in massive splashback that I will not subject others to.
What is your immediate perception of a woman that has no social media or online presence?	A) she's probably as close to a perfect woman as you can find or B) she is hiding social media from you B is usually more likely	My wife has no social media presence of any kind. She's also the most grounded, stable, and reliable woman I have ever met. Great mom to my kids, fantastic wife to me, killer work ethic, etc. She did have a facebook briefly, but my family are a bunch of dicks who post gross photos, so she deleted her account and told me that social media is my problem now.
Have you ever asked a friend to set you up before? How did it go?	Never did that. Mostly because I'm awkward as fuck around people I've never met before, so just having a first date is bad enough. But also because my friendships are very one-sided. I care more about them than they care about me. I'm sure if I asked them to do that, they'd be all for it, and completely forget about it within a few days.	Yes. It did not go well. She arrived late, happened to run into a guy from her college at the restaurant we were at and then decided to leave me alone at the table to go chat him up for a bit. He was trying to have his own date at the time and was actually annoyed by her presence. I guess that she *might've* had a crush on him in the past, but his companion at the time wasn't pleased about it either. I, being alone at my table, had a nice meal (like fuck am I going to pass up a chicken biryani), paid for what I ordered and left. She didn't even notice. My friend, having found out what happened was quite mortified and hasn't (thankfully) tried to set me up since.
do you enjoy going on dates or do you do it just to get the girl, please explain why is or isn't fun?	I genuinely like meeting new people and trying new bars/restaurants/activities, so I generally enjoy dating. Bad dates are cringe at the time, but always make for a good story afterwards, so even that can be pretty fun. Mediocre, boring dates are actually worse, when you think about how you could have done your laundry that night instead...	I hate first dates. I love when you are like 3 months in and it is still honeymoon phase but you feel a lot more comfortable just staying in and watching a movie.
What are the worse traditions in romantic relationships that you wish had never existed in the first place?	Divorce. The male having to do the approaching and handling the rejection. That shit is literally the most frightening thing int he world, you know.	* Expensive wedding rings and expensive weddings. * The expectations that men should pay on dates (made sense when women didn't participate in the workforce much)
What would you think if a girl had to tell you she was dead in the middle of hooking up?	I like the fact that this is the currently highest post in the sub because of that typo Also, I would laugh my ass off if I accidentally knocked your magnets off and would then proceed with the fun	The more awkward you get about it, the more awkward it is. If your response to it is: "Oh my goodness I'm so embarrassed, I hate when this happens, I hope you're not freaked out by this, I knew I should have told you earlier, etc, etc", then it's going to be awkward. If your response to it is: "They help me hear. Don't stop.", it's really, *really* not going to matter. That's just my opinion, but I'd think most guys would feel similarly.
How can I stop using profanities so much?	My friend swears a lot. I told him, I won't talk to him if he keeps swearing. He's introverted and only talks to me. I tell him it's lack of self control and immature. Just remember to reevaluate yourself. Take a step back and ask yourself if you were talking way too much.	Try recording yourself saying them. Realise how boorish you sound. Experience the split-second cringe whenever you're about to say the profanity. Over time you'll eventually kick this habit.
Men in their mid 20's or later without a degree (or not following it) and working low wage/unskilled work. How do you feel about this and your future prospects?	I'm a firm believer that you should like your job, instead of just thinking about it like it's a pay cheque. That being said, it doesn't mean I think everyone has a to have a white collar job! Do what you like and if its also rewarding career wise, go have a ball.	I work retail and am 30. I'm going to school in January. I have no debt and no kids and a super supportive s/o. I'm really excited.
Think of the person you were MOST attracted to in your entire life. What ever happened to them?	She's across the country with her husband and kids and I'm stuck here with my wife who fell asleep on the couch (again) and hasn't touched me in months. I haven't chatted with her in about 3 hours and I hope she responds before I pass out because I want to fall asleep happy not just drunk.	I asked her to prom, she said yes, she gave me nonstop fuck-me eyes for two weeks, and then she got to know me.
People who actively worked on themselves before getting into relationships, what did you do and achieve?	Inb4 "start lifting". That's bullshit. You can be a strong SOB, but if you have no ego, all you'll be is a strong weakling.	It's been 3 years since I've been in a relationship, and I'm working myself up to asking this girl out. We've been friends for about a year, but I've been getting hints from other friends that I should go for it. I really hope this works out because I know that this is what I want. I'm not the type of person to *know* what I want, but this I'm sure of. Edit: Thanks for the support guys!
Fellas with full sleeve tattoos, anything you wish you knew before getting the sleeve?	Glad wrap is your friend after the tattoos. Proper care in the first week is paramount. Purchase a tub of aquaphor. For the first day, just wrap the tattoo with glad wrap. On day 2-4, smother it with aquaphor and continue to wrap it with glad wrap. Do this every 12 hours and wash gently with soap and water between dressing changes. After that, plenty of sun block and moisturizer lotion! I have a partial sleeve on my right arm that is gladiator armor that extends to my chest and back. I get compliments on it all the time when I am wearing a tank top. The more muscular you are the better just FYI. Muscles + cool tattoos = easy conversation with women.	Make sure you see a rough version of the design before the artists puts too much work in to it. They should be more willing to make adjustments and apply feedback if they havent invested a ton of time into it. Do not show up for your first session without having seen the final design. They may be the artist but you own the canvas.
What was your most awkward (but not neccessarily bad) sexual encounter?	I had a threeway that involved a girl whose boyfriend was out in the living room having a hissyfit the whole time. So we cucked some poor guy unintentionally. It was more distracting than expected.	There was a girl I used to hook up with just for sex. We were both single but didn't have anything in common except sex. We were parked in an alley and She is riding me in the backseat of a car reverse cowgirl and another couple just laid on the hood of my car and started having sex. We stopped and the girl on the hood looked up and locked eyes with the girl I was with for a good 5 seconds. We all just stopped.
What's the best compliment you've ever received from the opposite sex?	I just got, "you have the biggest dick I've ever seen, no really just looking at it makes me wet." she waited till she moved two states to say that....but you know still nice to hear.	“I'd say that you were the 5th most attractive guy in class.” — said by a girl in college. The class comprised of 12 students. :(
What stereotype about guys do you dislike?	That i cant cook or take part in keeping my home clean. Seems i have to prove to everyone i meet, again and again, that the kitchen is my turf and my so gets permission to cook,not the other way around.	I'm not an endlessly horny maniac, an unfeeling monster, or an expendable stormtrooper. No matter what my particular sex's (undeserved) reputation is.
From AskWomen: What things does your SO do that you aren't crazy about, but they aren't deal breakers so you just "let them go"?	So, this is a terrible example, but here we go. Whenever my girlfriend and I have sex, she wants to give me head. EVERY. TIME. I'm one of those folks that just don't get much enjoyment from receiving, but she's into it, so I go with it. I know..terrible problem to have.	She's gotten much better about this, but still happens on occasion: She takes ideas to do things and books me into her plans without consulting me on if I had my own plans for my free time. Then she's the first one to quit because it's not as she imagined. She also doesn't bring the recycling bin back in when she gets them from the road, instead she leaves it outside on the deck and piles both the cardboard and the metal/glass into the one other bin for me to sort through on my own if I don't catch it right away. I'm sure she'd have a *much* longer list about me.
What desperate attempts had a person tried to get you to date them?	A guy once asked me if I was a psycho bitch because I wasn't giving him enough attention, and then told me he really liked me. Yeah, ok, see ya, buddy.	A girl shoved two twinkies into her mouth to get my number. It was funny so we went on one date, it didn't work out after that.
How many sexual partners have you had? How many LTRs have you been in?	I'm 41. I couldn't tell you how many sexual partners I've had. God knows. 100+ I think. I've been in two long term relationships -I married them both. I had a long term affair as well but maybe best not to count that one.	I'm 25 and Asian-American. I've had sex with 3 girls, all of whom are also the long-term girlfriends I've had. I may sound old-fashioned, but I only have sex with a girl who I am officially in an exclusive relationship with. I have made out with girls at parties, and even tried to have casual sex with one, but I backed out of it because I just couldn't get more intimate without the emotional feelings a relationship brings.
How would you feel if your long term girlfriend has faked all of her orgasms with you?	I wouldn't care. If it was so unimportant to her she didn't bother telling me what she likes, that's hardly my problem. Keep moaning; I'm having a good time.	I would question why she wasn't upfront with me. Perhaps I could have changed that if she would've communicated her sexual needs. People that fake orgasms do more harm to themselves than to their partners.
What are your typical jokes when you flirt?	You want sum fuck? (I know I'm not a male, but this was a line I received. It was hilarious to me.)	Usually I would just tell stories about times I fucked up and it was funny. Like the time I got stopped by a dude walking his dog who asked me for directions to a downtown street. Right over his head was the street sign for that very street, and I chuckled at his expense and asked if he was blind. Then I glanced at the dog and realized it was a seeing eye dog.
Has a close friend ever tried to steal your relationship, what happened?	I was not close friends with the guy but I was close friends with the girl, and had a crush on her. He let her spend more than a few weekends alone with me on trips, which I would have trouble allowing knowing how it turned out. I thought I was doing fine hiding my feelings, but she eventually decided that her relationship had burnt out and she had feelings for me instead. I feel bad about it because I hate "vine-swinging" but I did keep the moral high ground as much as possible - I never touched her while they were a couple. She had a conversation with him before asking me out, and is still friends with him but never sees him in person.	Something similar happened to me with a friend. He was not a very close friend but I hung out with him a lot because he was new in town and I wanted him to meet people. He started inviting my gf to drinks and forgetting to invite me as well. She let me know and he acted like it was all a misunderstanding. Time has passed and my gf of the time and myself broke up and are both in new relationships. I still talk to her and apparently he tried his luck with her as soon as we broke up, and when she turned him down tried to hook up with her bestfriend. Now he tries to invite me to hang out every now and then and doesn't take the hint when I don't answer. Classy guy.
What's the hardest thing you and a significant other have endured together?	We lost someone very close to us a little while back. He didn't mean for anyone to get hurt, he just wanted to play. We miss you everyday, Harambe.	Cancer. My wife is currently recovering from vaginal cancer. It's fucking terrible but we are hoping to hear "cancer free" in a couple of months. What most people don't know is that the side effects of chemo and radiation are terrible but the worst part is that some side effects can become permanent so we will be dealing with this for the rest of our lives. She is 31 and has already had surgery on her cervix that was supposed to lower her risk but actual cancer in the vagina is pretty rare (as opposed to her ovaries or cervix) and women who do get it are typically over 50. As the radiation has made it pretty much impossible for her to get pregnant I am thankful we have already had kids and I'm hoping to get "back to normal" by Christmas.
My SO's "velvet" dick phenomenon... What are your other "sometimes my body just does that - no idea why" experiences?	Before people on here call that weird, I'll tell you that I know exactly what you're talking about and what it's from. Poontang is the ultimate wang moisturizer and I get "velvet dick skin" after sex, usually until the next time I shower.	Before people on here call that weird, I'll tell you that I know exactly what you're talking about. On some days my penis (especially the glans) just feels exceptionally smooth. I think it may have something to do with hydration.
To those of you who make over $100k per year and DON'T live in a major city, what do you do?	"Business Intelligence Developer" I don't live in a *major* city, but it's decent sized (~750,000 in the metro area). Median income here is around $55,000. If I sold my house (4BR, 1900, sq ft), I could get about $220,000.	IT Architect, bullshit title, but well over 6 figures in a smaller city where the median income is around 28k
Do you prefer a partner to be of equivalent intelligence, or do you prefer to be the 'smart' one/do you prefer your partner to be, and why?	I have yet to have a relationship with someone more intelligent than me. But intelligence isn't everything. My wife has a lot more EQ than I do, and helps me where I am lacking.	As smart as possible. My wife is a straight up genius. I like it. I'm not dumb myself, but what's hotter than a woman who can explain the subtleties of foreign policy who also happens to be a total babe? We kind of cover each others' blind spots when it comes to intelligence. She's a lot better at understanding people, I'm a lot more of an analytical type at coming up with what our options are at any given time. Together we are a superbrain.
As a male, nearly all of my closest friends are female. While it's not an issue, I'm the only guy I know who almost exclusively has female friends. How normal is this?	Ive only ever seen this with gay men because they fear they won't be able to fit in with men as friends because they'll be made fun of. This was particularly evident in high school and the women are more accepting and understanding. I personally, in my late 20's don't have and never had a single woman 'friend'. Everyone I know is like this too. The only time I pay attention to a woman is a) If I have too or b) If I like them. For these women you are 'friends' with. How many would you sleep with?	My closest friends are all female. One I thought was male and then she came out as trans. ... traitor. I love her tho EDIT: Should probably clarify that I mean I met her as a "John" and now she goes by "Jane".
If you were turned into a woman indefinitely, what is something you would miss?	Everything? I really like being a white male. I'd miss having every priveledge. I'd miss making more money. I'd miss being able to throw on a rumpled t shirt and jeans and go out, and not be judged harshly. I'd miss peeing anywhere. I'd miss opening the door without checking who it is. I'd miss walking home alone at night without paranoia.	My motorcycle. A sundress looks like the most comfortable and efficient piece of clothing ever made and I doubt I'd ever wear anything else, but it'd probably be pretty hard to ride side-saddle.
What has been your experience with girls you match with on dating apps vs girls you get in real life?	In real life it's fairly easy for me to get what I'd consider 10's. Online I can barely get a fucking 5. And even then half of em are flakes.	I get a lot of professors and vegetarians. Across 3 different dating sites. I am neither a vegetarian nor was I ever a good student. I have no idea what's going on. For the most part, online dating has been a hilarious dumpster fire. It's one avenue among many, but it's still mostly terrible.
I noticed that some men think a woman can go from a 10 to a 3 because of her personality. In what situations can a 3 get to a 10 because of her personality?	Doesn't matter. 1) Most guys are 4s. 2) Most women who make an effort, even if they're fat can be someone's 7,8, or 9. Your number changes more based on who's looking at you vs your attitude 3) most guys aren't confident to enough to talk to a universal 8,9,10.... the type of women on magazine covers. 7 range will always get approached more	I can throw a 100lb weight off of a building. I can't throw it back on top from the ground. Some things only work in one direction.
What would be the best/most useful superpower to be able to use during sex?	A hand that turns into a vagina so I don't have to deal with women to have the nice feel of a vagina on my penis	My wife and I could shapeshift to anybody we want. **Me:** Hey hun, how about......Katy Perry tonight? **Her:** Ok, sure. You be Chaning Tatum. **Me:** Ok! So should we record this and sell these tapes? We would be rich, and get to fuck anybody we want without cheating.
How many of you actually met your SO at a bar?	Reddit bar crawl. In short, we met, she asked me about my job, I told her not to ask me about my life, she asked if I'd be interested in getting together some other time, I said maybe, friends for a year and a half then started dating.	I did. Me: manager/roadie/sound guy of local band in college Her: came to a show at a college bar with her then bf, who was an acquaintance from class. After the show, he came over and said what's up, introduced me to his gf, and I remember thinking to myself "he ain't doing bad." Fast forward a few months later, they'd broken up, we were at the same party, and I was about 3/4 of the way through a case of southpaw. ended up making out on the side of the house for like an hour. That was about 16 years ago. married 11 years now and have two kids.
I lost my 3rd job in 9 months......What am I doing wrong??	where are you from? must really suck if employers can just sack you like this. blame the system, where they can just kick you out at will, honestly. There could be really lame reasons behind why you were fired but nobody will be held accountable so they're good enough.	I'm going to answer bluntly Most people I hear that say they don't know why they keep getting let go from so many jobs are fooling themselves about their abilities, or even why they were let go in the first place. > Small company, fired because I was late. Even though I was salaried and No, it matters. You were late. There's a start time and people depended on you to be there. People likely said "Damn, I need to talk to Dante, but he's not here yet". > had made mistakes but they were technical, minor, easily fixed Mistakes add up $$$. Are you sure it was a few minor mistakes, and not something much much larger
Sugar daddies, approximately how much money do you give for what in return?	I've been offered to be a sugar baby basically, and I lol'd. I had no idea what the set-up was supposed to be (I never did it) until I told people later. I value my time too much to everrrrr get involved in this shit. I do know this one girl I used to work with who does this though. She's my age (26), and hangs out with some 42 year old (who looks surprisingly young, I might add). She gets to go to courtside games with him, gets fancy dinners, he buys her designer shit, etc. She claims they don't sleep together, but she is probablyyyyyyy lying. I don't know - she says he just wants someone to talk to her, to accompany him, etc. I don't know if I buy it but it's not my place to judge.	7k to 10k base/month for the good looking ones. There's a subreddit for this stuff. I read it if I want to feel sad.
What's up with dudes not knowing how to wipe their butts?	I dated a physician in his early 50's that would leave brown streaks in his underwear. When I brought this to his attention he got upset and said that it was a normal thing. Dated a PhD in his mid 30"s with the same problem. When confronted same reaction and answer. The list goes on. Regardless of age, education or socioeconomic status... most men do not know how to wipe their ass.	I always assumed people who have problems with that are eating such horrible diets that every bathroom trip is a major toxic sludge cleanup job. More fiber, less grease. If you're regularly in there wiping all day something is wrong.
How comfortable are you with platonic same-sex physical affection? How often do you touch and embrace friends?	Never, I keep that connection for my girlfriend. I don't think it will ever be seen as normal for two males to do things that you said, unless they're partners or flirting. I don't think males need to bond that way, that's what fist bumps and foul mouthed insults are for, that's how males treat their friends	In my experience guys don't really do this, some times we'll briefly hug or clasp hands if we're greeting each other but by and large we're much less touchy feely than women I think. All my female friends are super okay with hugging for seemingly no reason and it's pretty disconcerting. Maybe I'm just fucking gay
How do you react when a girl says she wants to be just friends?	I don't even call this friend zoning btw. It's literally just that we didn't agree on something. And because I'm an asshole my thought process is partially fueled by why should she get all of what she wants, when I get none of what I want? That's a bad business deal.	At some point after, I let the line go a bit cold because my actual friends are expected to reach out to me too. These "let's just be friends" gals never do.
What was the last straw that ended your relationship, was it one big thing or a bunch of little things?	I had lost feelings for her long before, but was too cowardly to admit it. So I cheated. She eventually found out, as one always does, and ended it. It's not a mistake I will ever make again.	She stood me up for her own birthday date that I had planned, despite the fact that it was for an experience that was a childhood dream of hers. When she rolled in six hours after we were supposed to have left, drunk as hell and unapologetic, I knew the relationship was dying without hope of resuscitation and euthanized it on the spot.
When was the last time you were truly happy?	Not a guy (sorry? ;) but I just wanna comment on this post. Probably one of the most "beautiful" questions I've read on Reddit so far. I know how often men can be neglected by people or society if they are truly happy or not. :) Sadly, I've never asked my father this question. But I think I probably knew the answer anyway. :) Wish all of you guys as happy as a clam ... :D	This is sick and twisted, I was in Iraq, we were constantly playing practical jokes on each other. I forget the joke or the series of jokes. I was laughing so hard I was crying, I forgot we were all in a big pile of suck we were just a bunch of friends having a good laugh. Life made sense. We were with people that we trusted, outside the wire were the people that hated us. At home, safe, were the people we all loved. Then I came home, and life went to shit. Edit: I hope you all don't mind, but I'm using this as a therapy session.
How would you feel about a female friend of yours asking you to be her casual date to a wedding?	Youre obviously hoping that he will read romance into the invitation here, I guess I would take it at face value though.	People do that sort of thing all the time. Just call him or shoot him a text asking if he wants to go with you. Edit: A word.
How many of you actually believe in the "nice guys finish last" concept?	I've turned down guys for being: * Rude * Ugly * Passive * Unreasonably clingy Nowhere does "nice" make this list.	I think where this idea comes from is people confusing being nice with passive and mean with assertive. Assertive people tend to do better in life because they go after what they want and let others know what they want, but it is entirely possible to be both nice and assertive.
what country would you like to visit?	America. I live in southern Canada and can basically go whenever I want, but I want to visit before the election cuz I don't plan on going for the next 4 years.	I always wanted to go to Hong Kong, so I booked a trip this November. I'm going by myself. Why? Because I desperately need to do something that isn't routine.
If you've ever broken up with a woman due to physical features out of her control, what was that reason?	Honestly, her boobs were really ugly. I actually made her keep her shirt on. I was only 18 back then and a bit of an asshole. Baloney nipples are baloney nipples though.	Voice. I just couldn't fucking listen to her talk. Which was no fault of her own. She was lovely other than that. But her voice was like nails on a chalk board.
Why aren't trophy husbands more popular?	Because men are shallow idiots when it comes to dating. But there is a deepness to that shallow nature. We find our therapy in sex wayyyy more than women do. Women seek out money and stability. Men seek out sexual therapy- or, in other words, they treat sex as a way to feel better. Women see things like financial stability, wealth, etc. as a way to feel better. To feel protected, I guess. (Of course, that is a generalization and everyone is different. For me personally... No matter how rich or successful I got, I don't think I'd ever consider a trophy wife.)	A trophy husband is a rich and successful man. You earn this trophy by being a very hot and not necessarily bright woman.
How many of you guys don't really care about food?	I eat because I have to, I have low appetite and very picky about what I eat. Pizza is life tho.	I'm completely content eating trash, or eating the same thing consecutively, or whatever. I don't when my wife is around because she deserves to eat like a human, but if I'm at home cooking for just myself, I'm good with a PB & J with a bowl of cereal or WHATEVER is lagging sound the house.
Men who have used steroids, what negatives have they had on your body? Were there any unexpected positives? And are they actually bad for you?	I've never done them myself, but I lived in a dorm with 2 guys that did. Roid rage is a real thing, and the amount of acne and bacne they had was insane. I highly recommend staying away from them	300 mg test and 300 mg tren a week. No negatives - slightly higher acne once you stop, but I'm also on accutane at the moment which keeps it all clear. Pros - gains come as long as you diet. Only thing is that if you let your ego go too hard (like some of my friends), you'll hurt something because your tendons dont develop as fast as your muscles
Have you ever slept with a good friend? How did it happen, and what came of it?	Eh, we didn't really sleep together, we were watching TV cuddling/spooning, one thing led to another and as the great Red Green says, "If a woman doesn't find you handsome, she should at least find you handy." But we stopped hanging out to watch movies or TV because we can't trust ourselves now.	Yes. We'd been drinking together regularly and the flirting had slowly gotten more and more physical, and we were both single. Sent her a not sober text saying I wanted her after one of those nights of drinking, woke up to a reply saying she did too. Explored that for a few days and we seem to be moving toward a relationship, so so far, so good.
What are some red flags women should look for in men?	That guy is probably just trying to make up for his lack of looks? Maybe he's worked hard at getting a decent career, and has probably been told his whole life that it will help him get women (which is definitely a lie). There's probably nothing wrong with him really, harmless but frustrated and lonely. Ok, maybe not the best social skills. Speaking as a man I'd say superficial charm should actually be your biggest red flag, because that's highly indicative of a psychopath. The guys with poor social skills are harmless, they just need told what not to say.	1. Failure to take 'no' for an answer. 2. 'Loan sharking'; holds favors over your head or implies that you 'owe' him. 3. A lack of consistency between word and deed. 4. Speaks extremely poorly of others or treats other poorly. 5. Everyone in his past seems to be either crazy or an asshole.
Men, what makes you feel sexy?	Women. Honestly I can feel good wearing nice clothes and stuff but women make me feel sexy. Can't nothing beat a woman want to put her hands on you.	There was this girl I used to see. We didn't really date per se, things didn't work out, but we were quite fond of each other for a small period of time. We were sitting on a couch and were holding hands, when suddently she jumps out of the couch giggling and going somewhere else. I took it as a weird epiphany of rejection, but later that day she sends me a text telling me "Sorry about that, but you made me wet and didn't want to embarass myself in front of everyone". Sweetest thing anyone ever said to me
Have you ever walked out on a film at the cinema? If so which ones?	Batman v Superman - I actually walked out on this with my dad as it is without a doubt one of the biggest pieces of shit to ever hit theatres	I ended up walking out of the Green Hornet. I spent almost half an hour wondering when Ryan Reynolds was going to show up, and then I realized...
Fathers of Reddit, what's your "how I met your mother" story?	She was on Tinder and I saw that she hated sex, her 3 children were her world, and that she needed a man in her life because the kids are her world. How could I not swipe right? How could I not swipe right after seeing the angles she used in those pictures!	I was being an asshole in a chat room on AOL in 94 and she called me on it. Been together ever since, now have 3 kids.
Why is the ______ that you make the best _____ in the world?	nothing, I'm not quite that big of an egomaniac and I've worked with professional cooks since I was 15, no matter what it is there's some 65 year old somewhere who's been making that one dish since he was 12. That bit of pedanticism aside I make bomb ass food across the board thanks to the whole working with much better cooks since I was 15, my best stuff is probably fresh pasta. Raviolis with a mix of ricotta parm and asiago with an egg yolk nested in the middle before covering with the second sheet, cooked up then covered with a light chicken garlic sauce with cream and tomatoes, a bit of butter... It's like the fattiest thing on earth but it's so goddamn decadent I love it. Also make really good chashu with applejuice, butter and star anise in addition to the usual japanese seasonings	The sex I make is the best sex in the world, because I've enjoyed it more than all of the sex that I didn't make.
If dating supposedly becomes easier for certain men in their 30s, then why can't social life and making friends be the same way?	Because women in their 30s who are single have realised they're not the cream of the crop and have lowered their standards. They've finally realised they're not going to marry the captain of the football team no live happily ever after. Either that or they're divorced/single moms who are very desperate.	Because idiot teens and college kids aren't lining up to hang out with an older guy because he's interesting. Dating is easier for them because younger women find them more appealing. Totally different dynamic from making friends. Making friends is harder because everyone is married, has kids, or their career, and not much reason to meet new strangers.
How do you feel about men who don't take lesbians seriously?	Remember that these men are not representative of the whole of mankind. They're just the ones that you remember, because nobody ever remembers the things that don't happen. Pretty much by definition, the only guys that are going to have a strong reaction to your sexuality are going to be assholes. The ones who don't think it's a big deal and simply accept it just don't say anything about it one way or the other. It sucks that you have to deal with assholes, but that's life. Just try to remember that just because they're the ones making the most noise, that doesn't mean they're the only ones that exist.	See, I think straight men should have no problem understanding lesbianism. Personally, I don't find men attractive or sexy at all. And really, I can't understand why so many women do. Don't get me wrong--it's great that they do, and that some men are also attracted to men. But the idea of a person being attracted only to women makes so much sense to me, because that's how I am.
When does life start to get better?	1. You're seeing mostly rich white kids having the time of their lives. 2. These are just the high lights. Odds are their experiences weren't anywhere near as great as they make it out to be. They're largely lying to maintain a narrative. 3. Get off Facebook and Instagram. They offer nothing of value. 4. You have to put yourself out there. Start making friends. 5. I won't lie to you kid. Life gets harder after college.	People always put the best aspects of their lives on social media, take it with a grain of salt. Everyone has issues in their lives. The only way to make your own life better is actually doing whatever makes you happy. Don't expect some magical event that'll change everything into rainbows and sunshine. Life doesn't work that way
What was the biggest wake up call in life for you?	After all my friends and family left me, i realised you can't count on anyone but yourself and relationships are not forever	I realized I was 23 and would be working at this shitty factory my entire life unless I did something. So I went to school. I still work at this shitty factory, but in addition, I also work somewhere in my preferred field and I should be able to quit here within about two years.
I'm getting married next year. My fiancé's family is much more financially secure than mine. Now they want to buy her a house. Guys that have been in similar situations, how have you dealt with it?	1. Sign the pre-nup. Be a bigger man, don't go after the house, let it stay separate, 2. Take the house, use the rent-free living to fill up your OWN (NOT just your wife's or your shared) account, 3. Have fun doing fun stuff, 4. Her family might use that house to have some influence in your life, which isn't a big deal. Given you are getting a free house to live in!	Your plan sounds quality - use the house as a way to save your money and investments while you live mortgage-free and save up to buy something together. When it comes time, sell the house. You have an opportunity not to be burdened with debt. Take it.
What was the defining moment where you found your self-respect?	For me it was a steady improvement. Once I stopped putting women on pedestals I was probably in my mid to late 20s. I had some other stuff going on in my life that allowed me to become 100% confident, and happy with myself. It was a refreshing change in my life. Haven't been happier.	When I stood up for a friend that was being heavily picked on in high school. I liked the guy so Fuck those people. We are still friends nearly 20 years later.
What are the differences of dating in your early 20s vs. your late 20s?	Early 20's immature and disrespectful in relationships for the most part (i.e. selfishness, not taking the other person into considerations). Near the end of your 20's if people have emotionally and intellectually matured a lot of the shit you've dealt with doesn't happen anymore.	Early 20s: I'm afraid to admit I'm trying to have sex with you. Late 20s: "So you wanna have sex?"
What male stereotypes are you sick of hearing?	That men think about sex every 7 seconds. The truth is, women are as horny, or probably even hornier than men.	"Guys are terrified of commitment and only want hookups." No, the guys you hook up with just don't want to date you.
What are your non-appearance based deal breakers?	From experience I know if the girl prefers cats over dogs we will not be compatible. Being stupid and/or ignorant is increasingly becoming the biggest deal breaker I have. Drug use gets an automatic nope. So does political differences.	She has to be kind. If she's not kind, it's a no-go. She can call herself sassy, sarcastic, driven, a diva, or anything she wants, but it doesn't matter. Either be kind or GTFO.
what are your thoughts on your SO wearing provocative clothing to a party that you aren't attending?	I have always liked it when girls I date dress more moderately with me. If they want to dress provocatively with their girlfriends, who am I to stop them? And honestly why do we as guys even care? Provocative clothing or not, if she is going to cheat she'll do it. If you can't trust her enough not to cheat, dump her ass.	There's something that doesn't sit right with me that I only see her at her best when she's headed out the door to mingle with other folks. Would you prefer more provocative dress when you go out with her, or less when she goes out without you? You might get the first one, pushing for the second is just going to make you look like an ass.
What is something you want to complain about, but complaining about it would come off as a humblebrag?	I've fucked 4 new chicks this week and it's stupid. They all want to hangout after and it's super annoying	I feel like a dick for ever posting on social media so i don't. It feels like everything, even complaining, comes off as bragging. I moved away from my home town and live by the beach, year round perfect weather, in a nice house, I'm in great shape, I just feel like a huge asshole.
Why is it socially acceptable for women to have sex toys but automatically weird whenever a guy does?	I think we need to differentiate between different kinds of sex toys. There's practically no stigma about the kind that men insert their penises into. Look at the movie American Pie. I remember when I was in grade school, guys talked all the time about how they masturbated, using lotions, making DIY-fleshlights (the most common, I think, was sponges inside of a bottle...), etc. On the other hand, there's a bunch of stigma against guys putting things up their butts, because that would be considered gay and unmasculine.	I have no idea. I'm a guy, and I have both dildos and a fleshlight. I just let them go at it, leave me out of it
Askmen, how do your dating experiences mesh with what you read on here?	Pretty consistent. Chicks are mostly interested in what they can get out of a relationship and not so interested in what they can contribute to one.	I don't know anyone killing it in the dating scene to be honest. Most of my friends would like to if given the chance, but at best usually settle down with one girl because they don't have the option to just fuck around. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but studies have shown this generation is having sex less than the previous generation. My reason as to why is with the rise of online dating, people are getting pickier.
How much did your college grades matter to where you are now in your job? What is your job?	It matters a LOT for the first job. Many companies in my profession, Software Engineering, won't even look at you if your college GPA isn't 3.5 or up. Once you're no longer a New College Hire though, it doesn't matter much at all.	I'm a software engineer and I literally did not include my GPA on the resume that I used when I applied towards the end of my last year. I was never asked about it either. Honestly I don't even know my final GPA
What's something you never want to know about your gf/wife?	Anybody saying sexual history is either insecure, jealous, hypocritical or a mixture of the the three. Home girl got some. So did you (probably). Why be squeamish about it? Chances are, if she did it a lot, she's probably pretty fucking good at it by now. As long as people are safe, don't judge and don't get grossed out. She's taking your dick now so be fuckin' grateful. Grow the fuck up. /rant EDIT: a comma	What she looks like dead. If it weren't so selfish and horrid a thing to say, then I'd hope I kick the bucket before her.
Aloof men of reddit, how do you pull it off when it comes to attracting women,dating, relationships, or whatever you call it?	Start with tic tacs. Move in for the kiss. Tongue down the throat. Grab the downstairs business. Deny it when anyone asks. :)	Why would you want to date someone if you aren't interested in what they have to say? Small talk doesn't have to be about the weather, it's just a way of broadly getting to know someone until you hit upon something you connect on and can talk more deeply about.
If you were given one free pass to lose your shit on someone for anything, no matter how minor, how would you use it?	The harambe shit. Not the dicks out thing, your dick should be out for the rest of your life to remember that magical gorilla. I mean the angsty mourning. No one knew who harambe was before he was killed, acting like someone murdered your spouse for a laugh isn't going to bring him back and no, for fucks sake, you probably don't care about the gorilla more than its handlers did or have a better understanding of how to handle that situation.	My brother. He went awol from our family a couple of ywars ago and married this absolute cow of a woman. I'm not sure what was happening in his head but he called my parents and started abusing tbem over the phone. They hung up and didn't answer his calls anymore. He called again and left a message My mum played it for me and I nearly left then and there to kill him. He raved about how my dad was a spineless cunt and mum was a fat bitch, that my grandfather would roll over in his grave (my parents did nothing). He's been more than a fuckup his entire life, a million chances given and all of them fucked away. So if I had one shot, no consequences. I would tear out his fucking heart.
AM, have any of you dipped your pen in company ink? How did it turn out?	No. I've never been attracted to any guy I've worked with, and even if I was I'm not that stupid. Plenty of other guys in the world.	Sort of I guess. When I worked st the hospital a nursing secretary and I had a thing going on for a month or two. Got oral pretty much every day after work for a while. Was a good few months until she went back with her ex. No real relationship and no drama. 10/10.
How would you feel if a woman asked for an STI test on the second date?	I would move on; out of all of the women I've been with, no one has asked for one. I'm just honest with them and tell them the truth as they are with me. Asking for a test is not the norm in today's culture and it would inconvenience me more to have it done than not.	At first it would be weird. Then I would imagine reasons why she would ask that and conclude that she would like to fuck. Which leads to me agreeing to take a test if she does the same. Let's go do the tests together why not?
Fellas with names that are traditionally female, did your parent ever tell you why they gave it to you?	My dad left me and my mom when I was born, right after I was named. I finally met him some years later and asked him why he named me Sue, he said this world is rough and if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough. He wouldn't be there to help me along, so he gave me that name and said goodbye, he knew I'd have to get tough or die, or that AskMen should consider adding a serious tag option when posting.	My ex's parents thought they couldn't have kids, so they adopted two kids who happened to come from Korea, they gave them Western names, then my ex was born, so to "even" things out they gave him a traditionally Korean name, which is a female name in the Western world. His parents were awesome, they later adoped their friends son after she passed away, the kid was black and a bit of a trouble maker, he kicked his football into the neighbours garden and messed up some flowers, the neighbour called up the parents to complain and said *"Your coloured son ruined my flowers"*, ex's dad replied *"You'll have to be more specific about which colour, I have one black, two yellow and one white."*
Guys who have high sex drive but your SO has a low drive, how is it like?	It will always be up to the higher sex drive partner to "shift it down". You can't make your partner increase her sex drive without it becoming pretty rapey - it's just who they are as a person. Can you be satisfied in a relationship that gives you (considerably?) less sex than you want? Your call to make. My answer would be *nope*. I would end up cheating on her, which is even shittier for both of us.	It sucks. One of you will have to make changes. You'll either have to accept fewer sexual encounters or she'll have to try to do more. That is if you stay together.
Guys that get the feeling that a girl isn't interested, but hasn't gotten a direct response where she says so, what's your approach? Did you ever get a confirmation?	Bite the bullet, ask directly. The grey area is the worst, and it's not like asking her is going to reduce her opinion of you. Either she is and was willing, and you succeed, or she isn't and you move on to others. Don't let ambiguity disqualify yourself but equally do not waste time hoping to charm someone who isn't reciprocating.	>didn't offer to reschedule. I read that as, "Not interested. Move on." If she was interested AND at able/willing to initiate (both requirements for me), she'd have offered an alternate time or option. Or even invited you to ask after X date. So, either she's uninterested, or expecting you to do all the planning and pursuing. Either way, dude, pass.
Married men of AskMen, what do you do to be a good husband?	I stopped being the doormat earning all the income, doing the majority of the housework, and catering to her every need. I stood up to her, and manipulated her into seeing a therapist which she desperately needed.	I keep my shit together when things go wrong. I handle the hard stuff. I be the unwavering rock in the face of adversity that she wants. I take care of the house. I'm a good father to our son. I keep "dating" her, despite being married for 11 years. I work hard to make things better for our family. I fuck her right, fuck her often, and I make sure to throw in some spontaneity. I hit the gym, keep in shape, and maintain my appearance to make sure I *stay* fuckable. I let her know as often as possible that she's one of the best things that ever happened to me.
Fathers of askmen. You come home from work and see your 8 year old son has taken a golf club to your 40 year old project car. What do you do?	Beat his ass. Take all his toys. Beat his ass. Ground him. Beat his ass. Explain to him just how much he fucked up and try to understand his stunted and retarded 8 year old brain (he should be old enough to know better). Beat his ass and send him to bed with no dinner. Wait for him to fall asleep then wake him up with some more whoopings	I'm not a father but I'd assume you'd want to murder that little bastard and just start over? 8 years doesn't seem very long to do it all again.
What was the moment you realized you didn't love your significant other anymore?	we were having sex and she had poo on her butthole. i felt the love leave me. it was the end anyway, but man did that let me know.	Friend of mine went on a vacation with her husband of 3 years, a few years ago. They booked a private cruse around the gulf for the evening, fancy dinner, all that stuff. So after the dinner, in the middle of the ocean, after they finished a slow dance, he just blurts out "I don't love you anymore. I want a divorce." And pulled a packet out with the divorce papers he had gotten some lawyer to draft up. She said the real shock was looking at them and seeing that he had already signed them. Fun boat ride back I'm sure.
Parents of /r/askmen, if you had the funds to move your immediate family anywhere in the world, where would you go and why?	I wouldn't. I live in a safe neighborhood in a safe city where both my wife and I have stable and good paying jobs, my daughter has all her friends and mentors, and uprooting them all just for some fantasy of living in some exotic locale would be foolish.	Always thought New Zealand seemed nice. Rustic, quiet, and about as far away from the crazy northern hemisphere as you can get. Plus hobbits.
How can women compliment men?	If you preface every interaction with "I have a boyfriend", anything you say after that will be purely platonic. As for how I feel when receiving a compliment, it feels good, like the rest of the world is finally catching up to these great things I already know about myself.	Generally speaking men don't get complimented from strangers. You can almost say anything. Something about self worth is a good way to go. "Hey I like that jacket, fits you well, dude."
Do any of you go through times where it feels like every girl wants you then times where it feels like no girll wants you?	Sure. Women put it on a platter for me now that I'm married. When I was single, much less so.	Not *every* girl, but there are times when I feel like I'm actually getting attention from women, and times when I'm just like an object in the background to them. Weirdly enough, the amount of attention I get seems to be inversely proportionate to the level of motivation and direction that I have in life.
Whats your favorite hobby that you don't have people to share it with?	Physics and advanced mathematic topics. Topology, abstract algebra, knot theory. But as soon as I mention anything quantum, the eye glaze begins	I like playing DnD but it's difficult to find other people that play. The stigma is strong where I live.
For those of you who are middle class, how has Obama Care effected your ability to afford health care?	From a non-American: Somebody please explain to me how Americans don't seem to understand that there is a significantly better way, IE regulating what medicine costs in the first place, leading to afforable socialized healthcare. Every other country in the developed world has social healthcare. You're standing alone in making health and well-being a fucking trade commodity. I'm currently battling cancer. I've had a surgery, two CT scans, maybe a dozen blood tests, countless appointments at the hospital, and I'm about to have a cycle of chemotherapy. At the end of it, I'll have paid $7 a day for it, and that's for the hospital parking lot. I don't have any health insurance, and I pay 12% income tax. *There is a better way.*	I am barely middle class, and I haven't been able to afford insurance or qualify for medicaid. I'm in the place where I'm too poor for one and too rich for the other.
What male stereotype pisses you off the most?	Male privilege, implying that female privilege doesn't exist and we are somehow better off in society. Just last week the wife was going on about how in 1945 French women got the vote and how that was so late. She didn't care much for me pointing out that men had just been forced to die by the millions.	I hate the dumb, fat, bumbling, horny TV dad. I may be all of those sometimes, but not all at once.
Men who met their current SO in the "real world" (not school or online): how did you meet them?	School is the real world. Anyway, I met my ex at a club. She was not a random chick though, a friend's girlfriend brought her and introduced us. My previous GF, we were introduced too by a mutual friend, but this was in my late teens and in that friend's house.	I volunteer as a boxing trainer twice a week at a local gym for kids aged 12 to 16, one day a girl turned up to pick up her little brother, we got talking about how well he's doing stuff like that The next week the kid asked me if I would train him one on one on the weekends and I agreed, his sister came to every session and we got talking more and more eventually I asked her if she wanted to get a drink sometime and luckily she said yes That was 5 years ago an we're still going strong
On a first date, how do you physically greet a woman when meeting?	as a german, I raise my right arm and shout Hail Hytler ! On occasion I click my heels together at the same time, just to come across as really majestic and so forth. Only gets awkward when my date is of non aryan origin, but hey what can you do? Since I live in Berlin, we then go to the Holocaust Memorial Site and discuss how history should be written in books. trolling off course!	Don't go for a handshake unless you're meeting someone for the first time. For me - usually a wave or a hug. I usually go for hug because I like hugs.
What makes a girl seem unapproachable to you?	Just make sure you either have a lot of money or it's looking like you'll have a lot of money and you'll be set. Women want the benefits of success without working for it.	Why wait around for someone to approach you? People are there to finish school. It's not high school. If you want to meet someone you need to approach them too. Its not a one way street.
What do you prefer.. Large parties or small gatherings?	Funny thing is if you're introverted/asocial a large crowd is better for you because you get lost in it. No one is there to single you out because other people are there to have fun and they're not focused on you. A large part of self-conciousness and low self-esteem is focusing too much on yourself, especially your negatives and you begin to believe others are doing the same to you. Small gatherings would give people more of a chance to single you out. I'm introverted, I'm asocial/shy but when I go to parties/concerts I'm there to enjoy myself and usually no one is giving me shit. Small gatherings though? Easier to be zeroed out and put on the spot, and I don't like being put on the spot. So yeah I like large parties, just because I'm introverted doesn't mean I don't like to he around others getting lively.	Standard cop-out answer of "it depends." I would tend to prefer the small gathering, but sometimes I like a large party if I'm feeling especially sociable.
Men who have dated or married women with darker skin: what issues or judgement have you encountered, if any?	While I am hispanic, I very much look like a typical white guy. My wife is Asian, and younger than me, so I must have bought her on the Deep Web from a Dark Market as a slave from some whore breeding facility in Vietnam. something something rape culture toxic masculinity power positions shytlorde'.... My woman is more man than these judgmental witches will ever GET, and more woman than they'll ever BE.	Well, I'm a pale ass hombre, so even many White women are darker than I am, especially if they're capable of tanning. Had a black girl I was hooking up with shrink behind me and try to hide herself because she was paranoid about being stared at. That episode pretty much put the kibosh on going any further with her, because it was just too awkward and her behavior was actively drawing more attention, like we were somehow doing something wrong. I didn't feel judged, per se, and everyone around us was about as polite as to be expected given the circumstances, but I was concerned that she was going to make a scene or if someone was going to ask if she was alright and something untoward happening as a result.
How do you guys deal with thoughts about missed opportunities?	Everyone handles it differently. For me I'll still get a pang if regret whenever my mind wanders over trivial crap that happened 15 years ago. In the end you just have to learn from it. Do better next time and deal with the emotions of regret it guilt as it comes to you.	That stuff happens when I'm on long drives and for some reason my mind wanders. Not sure why. As far as dealing with it, the past is the past. It's not like it's the end of the world you missed an opportunity with a girl, you're in high school. You'll have wayyy more chances with wayyy more girls. And if you see this girl at school just walk up and apologize for being an idiot, and ask her to see a movie or something.
How many of you have gone to a party [where you don't really know anyone] alone?	I don't recommend it. Usually everyone just ends up staring at you trying to figure out how they know you.	I have been and it can be tough. It depends entirely on the people who are there if you are going to feel active. My advice, just get hammered and have fun, if you get off putting vibes or something then dip. Fuck em
How much did you change physically from your High School graduation to your college graduation?	I haven't graduated college yet but I graduated high school a dude and will (hopefully) graduate college as a woman.	When I graduated from high school, I was mistaken for a middle school student. When I graduated from college, I was mistaken for a high school student. That was progress, of a sort.
What does it feel like to have a girl love you?	Kinda like having a puppy love you, but boobs and manipulation. So....I guess I don't actually know because I was practically a human pacifier to satisfy an emotional gap while they rebuilt their confidence. Highly overrated.	Once you get past the infatuation phase, it's kinda like a warm fuzzy blanket. I love snuggling up to my wife, doing things together, & spoiling her with random gifts. Seeing her smile makes my stress melt away. Sure, we bang too, but for me, it's more about knowing that all is right in my life. We share moments that make me feel like I'm having a pleasant dream during a nap under the sun. But I'm not dreaming. It's real. And that makes me smile from the heart.
Men who actually enjoy their 9 to 5 jobs, what is it that you do?	I'm not a man, but I am a forensic accountant and I love my job. I work from home and, as a morning person, like to get started around 530-6 and am finished by 230-3. I find my work very interesting, believe it or not, I know it's the epitome of a "boring job" but I get to look through other people's records, and have a tangible "output" in my job, which is satisfying and challenging. It's engaging and lucrative, but doesn't affect my life when I log out for the day - all in all, a perfect job for me	I'm a pizza cook. I make minimum wage but the pizza life is the life I love to live, plus minimum in Seattle is 13/hr so I'm not like SUPER poor right now. I see a lot of people, even at my job, hate kitchen work but I really can't see myself doing anything else as a day job, i really have a passion for pizza specifically
What decision have you instantly regretted?	Banging a fat chick at a party. I immediately realized what I had done. My friends still give me shit for it to this day. edit: It happened 4-5 years ago. Still get grief over it. Especially because the girl went from fat to insanely fat. I just try and forget....	In an interview. Interviewer: "Do you smoke?" Me: "Like cigarettes?" Instant fuck up. The tone of the interview completely changed after that.
What are you tired of hearing about, as a man, about men?	Rampant Feminazism and her thoughts on men and how MOST if not ALL just want sex. NOPE I might ask the counter question? What if we jus wanted food, water and company of a friendly ladyperson to chat with? I am also the part of the menkind that likes old music of many varieties and expects nothing major in return apart from a peck on the cheek and kind smile if going on a date of sorts?	My favorite and im sure women hear it too. When you stop looking for the right girl, is when you'll find her. Shut up Grandma, I don't want to date my second cousin...
My co-worker just microwaved his fish dinner. In what ways has God blighted you recently?	FYI might sound bizarre but microwaving fish actually isn't bad - it's quick and it stays incredibly juicy, but you do miss the crust or browning from pan frying or baking. I hear microwaving bacon is also good. Marco Pierre White swears by it.	I experienced a sharp pain on my ass when pooping. Went to the doctor, turns out I have an anal fissure. For those who don't know, that means the skin inside my asshole tore open.
FAQ Friday: My SO has gained weight, what can I say to tactfully and respectfully bring this up with them?	Break up with her right away. She has shown that she has a genetic flaw, an inconsistent character and a lackadaisical attitude towards her health and the health of your relationship. You don't want to endure years of yo-yo weight issues.	First, get to the underlying cause. Gaining a "significant amount of weight" is something that should be looked into. Second, with the cause established, work with your SO on making whatever changes are required to bring them to a healthy weight.
Whats something that as soon as someone says it, you stop taking them seriously?	Islam is a religion of peace. BULLSHIT! Buddhism is a religion of peace, islam is a religion of oppression and hate and throwing gay peeps off buildings.	When they act like they are always the victim, or drama just happens to follow them and has nothing to do with them specifically.
How old are you and how often do you hang out with friends?	i'm 31 and i moved to a new city a couple years ago so I don't have many friends to hang out with. But back where I had a solid friend-base, about once a week.	I am 72 and all my friends are dead. Most of my enemies are dead too, but I'm working on it.
How do you get a 23 year old male adult to move out of your home?	poor kid. parents bring you into the world, mess you up and then kick you out when they don't want to have a constant reminder of the result of their incompetent upbringing staring them in the face around the house. and plz don't go comparing today to the good old days when your dad kicked you out of the house when you were just 15 - grandpa was ignorant af - that's not an excuse to be one too and it's actually much harder to make a living (or get a degree) today than it used to be. Wages have declined considerably from what they were a generation ago and college tuition is now as epxensive as a house. So yeah, go ahead, kick him out on the street. That no good bum, it's all his fault that he is this way right?	Make him start paying rent. He's an adult, if he wants to remain in the household, he pays rent, he contributes to chores. Tell him he's too old for you to be doing all his shit for him.
Are there any certain sex positions that make you feel closer to your partner? What are some intimate positions for you?	I'm reading all these "I don't have sex unless I have feelings" and im like "don't worry... you'll grow up soon enough and be one dead inside like the rest of us	I mean it's hard to beat missionary for intimacy. It's full body touching with lots of eye contact. Physically it feels as close together as you can possibly get.
My female friends advised me that I shouldn't shower my boyfriend with so many presents because men do not like to be taken care of like that...men, is this true for you?	It depends. If the sex is inadequate, yeah, I'll be totally put off and pushed away by nonsexual affection. Physical affection is the primary need I'm looking to fill by getting into a relationship, so that has to be satisfied before I can appreciate nonphysical forms of affection.	Unsolicited advice: don't take advice on how men think or feel from women. Women are not men. They don't know how we feel. This is why Cosmo is nonsense. Women telling women how men think. You wanna know how guys think, ask guys -- like you have here. Even better? Ask **THE** guy. Your partner. Ask *him* how he feels. It's entirely dependent on the individual. I, as a person, find it difficult to accept help, gifts, or compliments from people, friends, and partners. Family environment didn't include that sort of support. So getting that stuff now is unfamiliar and trippy. It's something I need to work through.
Married Men, what clever ways did you find to find out your wife's ring size?	She should be dropping some major hints. Things like pointing out rings she thinks looks good. Or making a habit of leaving one of her other rings lying around when she's gone. Leaving web pages open for rings. If all of that fails, ask her friends. If she's not talked about rings and such with her friends she's not ready.	When I started ring shopping for her engagement ring, I took a bar of soap and made an imprint of the ring she wore on her right ring finger. I took the bar of soap to the jeweler and told them it was the right ring finger, so let's go a very little bit larger. Worked perfectly.
Married men, if you suddenly ended up on the dating market again, what weirdly specific deal breakers would you have?	Not married anymore, but... Borderline Personality Disorder. If you have that I don't want to be anywhere near you, and if you have a shred if decency you won't try to subject people to dating you	Maybe this isn't "weirdly specific" but someone who is late all the time. I love my wife but she is so insanely disorganized and has absolutely no sense of urgency. I had a vacation coming up a few weeks, ago and a big part of looking forward to it was not having to wait for her in order to do stuff.
If you had to pick between having a girlfriend, but no friends or having no girlfriend, but really good male friends that you could hangout with, grab a beer etc. Which one would you pick?	Both are catch22 in my opinion. I love my girlfriend like crazy, she's awesome. But I also enjoy male camaraderie, sometimes women don't get fart jokes or why Fury Road is one of the greatest movies ever.	The girlfriend with no friends, because that's pretty much how my life has been since I moved to the UK. No regrets though, I love my wife immensely.
What advice would you give to women who struggle accepting their SO watch porn?	Find someone who does not watch porn. Also find a dictionary and learn the difference between lust and love, as well as real and fake.	I have lots of anxiety about being denied sex, and masturbating to porn helps get me through the days I can't have sex with her.
Fat guys: What did you eat today?	Nothing so far, I don't eat much which is my problem. 2 bowls of cereal yesterday. Has ask men assumed my gender?	2 bowls of oatmeal, 1 bag of salad, 1 salmon fillet, 1 container of rice, 1 protein bar. Currently 400 calories under my target for the day(which is 500-600 calories under my TDEE) Currently down 20 lbs with 30 more to go.
Why more men play video-games than women?	Why does it matter? Who the fuck cares if more men play games than women? Are you upset that more women are into shopping in malls than playing sports? >And all women i met say that gaming is childish. Stop looking for validation from others and DO WHAT YOU ENJOY.	Your question shows only half the picture. Casual gaming is dominated by women these days. All these games that run on your tablet or smart phone, or browser games are mostly played by women. Console and PC gaming, where people invest hundreds of hours are more of a male domain. I think this has a lot to do with the content produced. I feel that games on consoles are specifically designed for a male audience. I'm having a hard time to find a game on Xbox that isn't built around a mechanic of *kill this thing* (and I am totally okay with that). I suspect that it tends to a secret power fantasy men have. As for the women who call gaming childish, most of them watch TV for hours or invest their time in some other fashion. What makes that so much better?
What is something that you cannot understand, no matter how open minded you try to be?	Being that guy. I don't get how people are unwilling to try drugs just once in their life. Consciousness is one of the biggest mysteries of our existence, and you can alter it in very odd ways. I guess I get being afraid of addiction as a reason. But drugs are one of the most unique experiences you can have and many people just refuse to even consider being a little open minded about them.	People that lie about everything. I worked with a guy shortly after highschool who was clearly not athletic, yet he tells me he was on the varsity football team, and the varsity baseball team, and he banged probably 50 girls in senior year alone. Do these people not know that nobody believes them? What satisfaction do they get from spewing lies about stuff that nobody really cares about In the first place?
You buy a woman a drink at the bar, she's not interested in you. How can she politely express this?	When he buys the first one, say something along the lines of "I'll get the next one." or "Thanks, but let me get the next one." If he ignores this and buys the next round anyway, it's not on you.	Don't take it. Generally I don't like this practice. Half the girls I know do it intentionally in the hopes of getting free drinks, and guys are petulant about the practice when it goes the way you describe. Just don't be a part of it unless you want to maybe make a new friend.
What (trivial) knowledge might save your life one day?	If a French person asks if you want a tattoo on your body, say no. Armadillos can carry leprosy, and you should never underestimate an undomesticated animal.	If you feel like you are having a heart attack and decide to take aspirin, you **must** chew the aspirin for it to be effective.
What's the loneliest thing you've ever done?	I bought about $70 worth of sushi a couple of days ago. When I went to pick it up they put three pairs of chopsticks in the bag. I must have looked confused cause they asked if that was enough. I got embarrassed and said I needed one more pair. It was all for me except like two rolls for my boyfriend when ever he got home.	i once drove around town for 2-3 hours on my birthday so i could come back and lie to my parents that i'd hung out with friends. i didn't want them feeling bad for me if i'd spent my entire birthday alone in my room - which i wouldn't have been bothered by at all if i did do that, i just didn't want them to be sad or anything.
What are your best sex stories?	One time a woman offered to take my virginity. So we met up, had some wine, went back to my place and... Well we did a lot of stuff. But I couldn't get an erection, so we didn't actually have intercourse. And now I'm really depressed. That's my best and only sex story.	She got way too drunk on our lunch date at the bar. We go back to her place and she smokes weed for the first time ever. She gets super twisted. Despite me being 100% explicit about only wanting something casual, no omission just upfront she now decides to start crying and telling me she really wants a boyfriend. She takes on a 3rd person demon voice. "Fuck her. She wants you to fuck her just fuck her" no joke throaty like a movie I ask where the water is, grab my shit and sneak out. She texts me angrily 20 min later and then adds me on snapchat 3 months later.
How can I support my BIL through his divorce?	"I'm sorry that I didn't tell you fifteen years ago that my sister's a backstabbing slut"? J/k... Sort of. But that revelation which she confided in you would be a big help to him during the divorce process. Infidelity is usually frowned on in divorce court. Of course, you would have to take his side, and betray your sister's trust; but considering that she's in the trust-betraying business herself, I wouldn't lose sleep over that.	Offer to hang out with him regularly to help take his mind off things. Be patient with him. I'm sorry your sister did such a thing, and I ask you to inspire him so that he doesn't lose hope on life. Be a friend, be his hero, be his go-to-for support. If I were you personally I'd stick around long enough to make sure he ends up with someone who will treat him better, and make sure he's emotionally safe. Hope that helps. :)
Bachelors, what is your go to meat you cook often and how do you prepare it?	Instead of meat, try some grilled veggies. Slice squash, zuchinni, carrots, or any vegetable of the like in 1/4" slabs. Throw in a skillet with chili oil, sliced onions and garlic. Serve on toasted sandwich bun!	I buy boneless skinless chicken breasts in bulk, 40lb box for $45 at restaurant depot. Preheat oven to 400 degrees, rub chicken in olive oil and season with salt and pepper. I'll do other seasonings if i'm getting tired of salt and papper. 10 minutes in, flip, 15 minutes on the other side and check for internal temperature of 163-165 It's easy and cheap. I'll throw some asparagus in the oven too on some days, or toss it in a salad other days.
What did you learn about yourself from a failed relationship, and what change resulted from that?	she doesn't want an equal, she wants a captain. Women love up, not across and definitely not down. I tried to lift her up to my level and let her make some decisions in our relationship and she hated me for it. now i treat my women more like my first mate and they love it. Another way to look at it is im the king and she is my queen. You still treat her with respect and let her know she is important (first mates and queens are still highly ranked in their respectively) but the king always makes the final decision. tl;dr-women fucking love a man that acts like a captain/king/leader/etc.	I learned how insecure I was. I had no redeeming qualities as a partner. But the next couple of years were great as I focused on myself. I did a lot of growing and learning about just who I am. Really made me appreciate myself more and not completely look for happiness in someone else.
Why did men start wearing more conservative ties after the 90s?	September 11, 2001. After the towers fell, America became a much more serious place. The tone of movies and TV drastically changed. The terrorists in movies went from Russian to Middle Eastern. And men's fashion got a little bit more serious too, especially in the business world.	Wearing suits became something that's only done in conservative settings: Finance, banking, lawyers, and formal parties. Everything else went "business causal". The late 80s/early 90s felt to me like a start to that: People were wearing flamboyant ties as a way of being more relaxed about wearing a tie. In the end, this was replaced by not wearing a tie at all. As a side note, wearing ties was fairly common in settings where you'd never see them today. When I look at pictures from when I was a kid (1970s), my father was wearing a tie in everyday settings at home, with only his wife and kids present.
Men, what do you think of nursing as a career path?	Naturally I admire and respect nurses, but I could never work a job where I'm condemned to be eternally subordinate to someone with more extensive education. For me it was either med school or something in a completely different field.	I think it's a job that has insane hours and can be emotionally taxing depending on the specialization. It's not for most people. Fiscally, the career generates a lot of money. It's a well respected position that I see more men join every year. And it's rewarding in many ways grander than money.
Why is traveling viewed as so attractive and why do we emphasize it in dating and social media? Does it really make a potential partner more attractive?	When women say "I love to travel" in their dating profile, what they really mean to say is "I love to travel when you pay for it"	It's attractive to people who also want to travel and it's "exotic" to people who feel "stuck" where they are, or perhaps haven't traveled much. There's a lot of world out there. Some people are happy staying in their home town, some people want to go out and explore it.
Other than "nothing", what is the sexiest outfit you have ever seen a woman wear (in person)?	My ex had a perfect little body. She was shaped perfectly and had awesome muscle tone. She had a tight form fitting white dress with blue and green horizontal stripes at the top. The dress went all the way to her ankles so there was no skin showing except her arms. My god, she wore that on our first date and I could get nothing else out of my mind for the next month and a half. We went to some shitty bar and some dude grabbed her ass and I honestly couldn't blame him. I was fuming mad... but I understood.	A regular green bikini top and bottom. You know how in lame movies sometimes a group of husbands or whatever are all just sitting around by the pool and then their wives come out in swimsuits and the camera goes into slow-mo on them walking, some generic 80's arena rock starts playing, and the guys all lean in and tip their sunglasses down? Maybe one of them says "Daaaaamn" or some cheesy line? Yeah, that's how it felt when she came out. Damn, that girl was hot and she knew it.
What occupations are often looked down upon but without them society would crumble?	Most of the skilled trades. No woman wants to date an electrician, but good luck building a house in a world where they don't exist.	Sanitation workers. Actually went on a date with a girl a couple of months back who said that they get paid too much money for "such an easy job". Made me lose respect for her right away since these guys are working shitty hours, in the cold, in the heat, in snow, rain, etc and they're breaking their backs. It's a very tough job.
Fathers of Reddit, what can your daughter's boyfriend do to make a good first impression?	nothing. you want to fuck his daughter and he knows it. If anything, be respectful and ALWAYS follow his rules. if he says he wants her home by 11, make sure she's home by 1050. no excuses ever. Whatever he says, goes. He is the guy who is letting his daughter see you, don't give him any reason to regret it.	Walk up and shake his hand. Introduce yourself. In my experience, the "what are your intentions" talks rarely happen. Just be friendly and polite when you meet the family. Ask about their interests, they'll ask about yours. Just be respectful to everyone and you wont have a problem
What are your mental hangups?	* I'm really bad at tolerating bullshit, logical fallacies, intellectual dishonesty, willing stupidity or superstitious/religious thinking and can't stand seeing people applauded and rewarded for them. Following the recent US election has been a nightmare for me. (On the other hand, this quality makes me a better teacher.) * I have the capacity to be a caring, loving, encouraging, responsible adult towards my closest friends, but I have a hard time extending that to myself. I over-identify with the vulnerable parts of my psychology and often just forget that I am a strong adult as well. * On an intellectual level I can see why someone would want kids, but I can't relate to this on an emotional level despite the desire being so prevalent. This poses an extra challenge in my friendships with parents. Why are you asking?	I eat out of anxiety, so it would be great if my brain didn't scream at me to carb load every time something unpleasant comes up.
What's the worst/best pun/dad joke you know?	Slightly NSFW: Did you hear about the man who performed oral sex on himself and exploded? I guess you can say he, *blew himself to pieces*.	What's orange and sounds like a parrot? A carrot. I told that joke and my dad thought it was **hilarious**. Edit: I've been a dad myself for 9 years and my best rated comment is now a dad joke.
Men whose SOs have been sexually assaulted, how did you and your SO deal with it and how are you still dealing with it?	the fucked up part is that her friend left her while she went to the bathroom, vanished it seems while a strange man waits for her friend.. and then your girlfriend proceeded to allow the man to escort her to a hotel room before she got thrown on a bed and sexually assaulted. Some fish infested waters or story not told properly or fully. One doesn't just find themselves in a situation like that, alcohol induced or not.	> she went to the police but the police said if she wants to press charges, shes gonna have to stay in vegas for a week or come back after a week to deal with the progress, they told her its better if she doesn't, so and signed a paper with the hotel that she wont press charges. She cant go there again, she cant stay there for a week cause she has responsibilities, she has to work and make money to pay her bills.. That is waaaaay above reddit pay grade. Trauma aside, head to /r/legaladvice, they'll have advice on who to contact, because cops telling that, and hotels being that scummy is most likely not legal.
What do you think of when you see the term "Sapiosexual" in someone's dating profile?	Makes me much more likely to swipe right on a woman. I value intelligence and, being above average intelligence myself, but lacking in physical areas like height (am 5'6) - it makes me feel like I have a much better chance of matching with them and hitting it off with them since their attraction isn't based in the superficial.	"I'm an idiot who is easily amused by big words". Alternately: "I'm a tool. I'm such a tool I should have Black and Decker tatooed on my forehead."
What was the first step you took to change your life for the good?	Lifting weights. From the lifting I saw with my own eyes the power of my will to change my body and change how every single person I met would perceive me. I heard a lot of the new agey self improvement psycho-babble from lifting communities and was inspired at that time to start meditating, reading psychology books, and trying to take conscious control of as much of my life as possible. Sir Richard Branson was once asked what one habit would he have people adopt in order to change their being to shift their mindset to that of a more successful person and he said intense exercise.	Mid twenties. Decided to go back to university and get my engineering degree. With my wife supporting us I went back at 27. We had 2 kids while I was going, graduated with honors. Make a decent $100k/year after being out for 5 years. I think it was a good decision
Why do women get upset when men watch porn?	Weird cultural myths they have. Misinformation from religious types and radfems. Grossly misunderstanding what the fuck their man is doing in a relationship with them and what the fuck porn is for.	*Asks a bunch of men* Could be a lot of things, they probably think it harms women (it is a pretty messed up industry), they think their SO uses it to replace them, they think it's distasteful, they were brought up to think it was evil, etc.
What do I do if my friend's girlfriend dislikes me???	My best friend is female. My girlfriend has no problem with me being so close with her, but if she ever did I would choose my friend over my girlfriend. Your friend might not feel the same way though. Just be the bigger person and treat her better than she treats you. If she acts petty and you behave normally and your friend still chooses her over you, then he wasn't a friend worth having anyways.	Do you ever hang out with him and her? Maybe you should try to make friends with her by doing things together or something like a double date. That ways she'll see the nature of your friendship and might not worry as much.
Men of Reddit: How often do you find yourself turning down your girlfriend/wife for sex?	Never done it. I'm always the rejectee, not the rejector. Now that you've experienced it, hopefully you'll have more empathy next time you reject him. It always feels better when her excuse is reasonable, she promises it will happen soon, and keeps that promise.	Pretty much only if I haven't slept for like 3 days or if I have a stomach ache or something. Don't feel down. Guys aren't as desperately sex craved as the world would have you think.
Men in your thirties who are living a "prolonged youth" – enjoying life, your hobbies and your relationships without kids or other extra responsibilities – what are the drawbacks to your lifestyle choice?	No drawbacks for me. I have tonnes of time and money. I have sex with a couple new chicks a week. I see all my married friends when I play hockey and they wanna see pics and vids of the chicks I bang. I went to my nieces 2 year birthday party recently and all the couples with children look literally EXHAUSTED. Some of the mothers look like they've been through the war. The expression on their face said "Shit, I didn't know I signed up for this life"	Um. Well some family members (not all) bug me about kids and "when yall gettin married?" Some friends have dropped off the map. But I've since met new friends too. So I don't really feel alone that way. Occasionally I get to visit a long time friend and catch up. Other long time friends have remained ever present in our social circle even with their kids. Some folks become home bodies and some don't. For the record I've never been the type of person who has to keep up with some life script, as you put it. What was your reasoning for asking?
1 line of dating advice for your son, 1 line for your daughter, 1 line for both. What are they?	Son. She wants your wallet and your sperm, she doesn't love you. Daughter. All he is looking for is something he can tolerate and put his dick in. Both. What you call "love" is just nature compelling you to breed, it hits hard and slowly fades.	Son: Wrap it before you tap it. Daughter: If he doesn't respect you before sex he won't respect you after. Both: You deserve someone who makes you happy and should never settle for less.
What are your most controversial criteria when looking for a romantic partner?	Male here, I won't date or consider women who; Have kids, are fat, was fat once, have bad skin, have tattoo's (that can be seen in a cocktail dress), smoke, are uneducated, are ghetto, date outside of their race, are messy, have money issues, saggy tits, doesn't wear make-up etc Edit: chew's with their mouth open.	I won't date a woman with kids is my most "controversial" I suppose. I know that's not really so out there but a lot of people act like I'm the bad guy for not wanting that baggage/responsibility.
What's the best way to politely ask our neighbor to stop letting his dog shit in our yard?	There is no reason to be polite in this case. Just tell him to look after his dog. Be straight forward. Thats it.	I've had to do this. I just went to their door and said politely, "Hey, I'm not sure if you are aware, but your dog has been pooping in our yard. I was wondering if you could please keep him on your property?" It went well. They said they had no idea and it seemed genuine-ish. Anyway I'm mostly commenting to say that my city has a pet bylaw about this that basically states that if you allow your dog to defecate on someone else's property it MUST be cleaned up right away. There's a hefty fine attached to it if it goes that far. I would imagine that other city's have something similar so if the problem keeps persisting after trying to deal with it directly, you may have options.
What "terrible" advice is actually good advice?	"Be yourself". A lot of people take this advice literally and thus scoff at it, but it is a bit more complex than it sounds. If "being yourself" reveals you being a horrible and unattractive person, then by all means change who you are so that you not only *look* better to others, but also *feel* better yourself. Otherwise, do what you enjoy or are good at, and be your *best* natural self.	"Whoever cares more, loses." It's horrible to think about, but generally true. I wouldn't advise anyone to stop caring, but sometimes you have to recognize that you're putting yourself in an unwinnable situation.
Professionals of reddit, how do you negotiate a salary?	I love your idea here that only salary jobs are "professional". I don't work for free, so I ask to be paid hourly and negotiate the rate from there.	I have always said "Well I was hoping/expecting an offer of $X" (with X being somewhat above my true desires but not insanely more than the initial offer). Usually HR will get back to you within a day with a counter-offer somewhere in between. If it's high enough, take it, if not, offer another value in between the current and your last expectations. When it comes to benefits/bonuses it largely depends on the company if they even negotiate those. Most rigid corporate structures, and especially large nonprofits tend to have a set benefits plan including PTO and it's usually non-negotiable. If any part of the offer is non-negotiable, HR will usually tell you up front if you bring it up.
Fellas who have removed all their pubic hair, how is it working out for ya?	I wax and in general it's nice (takes like 15-30 minutes once a month) though the pain (it's really not that painful) and cost might not be for everyone. In general, shaving is annoying because when the hair starts growing in, it is a blunt edge (which makes it seem thicker) and is a lot itchier than with waxing. Also for me, I get less ingrown hairs with waxing which is also a bonus. If you do shave, don't shave around your asshole, it becomes the worst thing ever as hair grows in.	It was really nice and breezy to be honest, and not nearly as much ball-stuck-to-leg action as I expected! Would recommend
What do i do if my date is a communist, i'm a right-wing kind of person?	Write her off as a potential partner, go into fuck it mode and have fun with the date. Be goofy and silly because it won't matter. Then at the end of the date tell her you aren't interested and find someone else. Source: A Libertarian that has had this happen a few times.	You go on the date, and then depending on if that date goes well you either: a) go on another date b) dont
Ladies who like to hang out in AskMen, what is the one quality that can take a man from a "maybe" to a "yes" in your eyes?	Everyone's classified as a maybe (including the hot ones) until I know they see me as a person as opposed to an object. Also sentences like "rape is wrong" seem to be a decent indicator, you would not believe how common it is that guys think rape is okay! Oh, and of course, those lovely words: "I never want kids".	There was a guy I was somewhat interested in, then I saw him dance. I was like, I'm gonna get me some of that. Thought it would be my first summer fling, but we've now been together eight years.
Men who basically swim in pussy - what's it like?	Better than being in a relationship, honestly. I don't really care for those... women seem to crave attention and emotional closeness, so even if you're just fucking them, they'll still act like you're girlfriend, but you don't have to act like their boyfriend. It's nice. They'll buy you food and other stuff, fuck you, play with your hair, then ask why you don't call them back. Honestly I'm happiest when I'm screwing two or three different women on rotation. Also makes it easier to deal with their childish behavior.	I want a girlfriend but can't seem to get one. During work today I was texting some girl. We made a plan for her to come to my place after I finished at the gym. She brought a bottle of wine. We drank it and chatted. Then we had sex, she got dressed, and left. I have a couple of other women who'd do something similar for me. A few years ago I'd have thought that such an arrangement was living the dream. But I'm here alone and I just feel hollow. The instant gratification of a hookup is nowhere close to the feeling of sleeping with someone you really care about.
What are your thoughts on making the first move with women?	>sickens me. That seems a little extreme and I think you should examine where the root of that is. You might just be an asshole.	I stopped initiating for a while and it turned into not dating for 2-3 years. When I wasn't focused on dating, I had 7 nights a week to myself, all of my income was available for what I wanted to do, and despite sleeping alone every night, I still had a very fun and fulfilling life. Eventually doing that long enough (and trying to be mindful about my inner wants/needs), I was happy with who I was and the kind of life I was living, I felt more motivated to go out and initiate contact with the women. And once I did, I only went on a couple of dates before I found the woman that I've now been married to for the past 3 years. So I guess, if you don't feel it right now, then don't do it right now.
Men, have you ever gotten down to it with a girl, then immediately been turned off? Why? By what?	I was getting freaky with a girl once, then pulled down her panties and saw she had a full bush, even down to her asshole. It was revolting. I don't require perfectly clean shaven but that was just nasty	Pussy stank. It was well beyond normal vagina smell. That fucking thing smelled so bad that I began dry heaving and I actually am not easy to gross out. I just couldn't. I actually felt bad for her because she understood what was happening.
What was the most misguided notion you had about relationships until you were an adult?	I thought things had meaning or actually mattered. I thought love existed. Or that people would give a fuck about personality or reciprocation. It's all about what you can give and what you're willing to take. Looks, money, presentation, that's the most important thing. Anyone who says different is a fucking liar.	I thought that the way to be in a relationship was to do everything I possibly could to make the woman happy... By being somebody I wasn't; sacrificing my own friends, hobbies, social life... I basically felt like that's how life worked. So as soon as I got my first proper girlfriend I started trying to change myself. Hide my geeky and "immature" hobbies, be somebody I wasn't etc... "Geeks don't have girlfriends"... Or, only the rich ones do, y'know. Thank fuck I was wrong.
When it comes to a career, what are some horrible mistakes guys in their 20s should avoid?	Always negotiate your pay when being offered a job. This goes for women too. Men generally negotiate their pay upfront and more often. It helps to explain at least a little of the pay gap between men and women.	Work to learn, not earn. Don't tolerate a shit boss, move on. Time is as important as money. Does your pay rise come with more work, so you're actually no better off. Does saving $50 a week on rent mean you have a 1 hour commute instead of 20 mins, plus more cost in transport. Under promise, over deliver.
How have you handled a date where you got cat-fished?	Lol at the unnecessary hyphenation in "cat-fished." It is not like anyone is out there fishing for cats. The term refers to the actual fish: catfish	I went out with a girl who invited me to a bar. She was literally not even the same person as her photos. She was buzzing already when I showed up. 9/11 Consipiracy theorist. Looking to take shots at 4pm. I used a fake-call app to step away from the table. I literally just walked out and didn't come back and ignored the calls and texts. Fuck that shit. I was there a grand total of 8 or 9 minutes.
Have you ever backed out of sex, and why?	I have backed out of sex more times than I've had sex. I hate myself and my body and I can't abide the idea of someone else having to see it. And I'm naturally suspicious of anyone who claims to find me attractive. My brain tells me they must be lying and that I am a useless piece of shit. Edit- why would someone down vote this?	She wanted me to have sex with her on all fours. When she bent over, the smell was so potent it was like what I imagine gazing into the fires of Mt. Doom feels like. Even then, I was willing to muster on, but right as I was grabbing a condom, she apologized that she hadn't showered in two weeks. I learned that day it's "common for people to do that in the winter." Nope. Nope.gif. Nope.jpeg. Never.png.
Men of Reddit, what is the most touching thing that you've ever experienced or witnessed?	Sorano Hanako's moment of catharsis in Hoshi no Samidare. (Manga.) Where she reveals the name of her ability. That is a powerful arc.	I was driving home from college one day with my ex. While i am on a busy roadway i notice a duck going to cross the road. I looked at the oncoming car that wasn't slowing down. The duck tried to fly away, but got tagged by the car. I thought it must be dead. But it tried to stand up. I immediately pulled my car to the side and picked him up gently. I drove to 4 different animal hospitals in the area to find out they were all closed. He died 15 minutes later. My ex and I both cried. I am happy to have showed him some compassion in his final moments. We laid him to rest at a tranquil river.
Sup other dudes. Who else is going to be alone this Christmas? What are you going to do?	I mean, I'm not going to be alone but if I was my response would be: hang out, eat well, be grateful, go outside, get ready for a new day, go to bed early, read, sleep.	Get up unwrap the gifts I bought (and wrapped for myself) give my dogs their gifts. go to the gym. Cook my Christmas dinner ( bought a buncha seafood to make). Hang out with my dogs, enjoy my new toys and prob drink a lot of booze and pass out alone
Men of color, what life experiences made you realize your race was going to be an issue when it comes to dating and meeting women?	i didn't notice all this problem and I am not a white dude. Maybe because I do not care about girls who do not care about me.... So far I had relationship with two white girls and one asian. Honestly....you will find it amazing how it works if you can configure your body language correctly. Anyway, play the courting game differently if you are not white is all I can say.	Because white and Asian women have told me to my face "I don't date black guys." White fathers have warned me away from their daughters. Dated a Pakistani woman for two years, still couldn't meet her family for fear of her being cut off (they paid for her college). An Israeli girl told me she wouldn't dance with me because I'm black. And this is coming from a dude who isn't ugly, who is educated, who has a good job and isn't socially awkward at all. That being said, I have gotten with a couple white girls in the past. And I saw white girls getting with the athletes at my school all the time. So maybe white girls will make those exceptions occasionally, idk. Wouldn't date a white girl now, but I'm probably biased. **TL;DR: They told me.**
What do people consider you weird for?	I am constantly called out for seeming to know too much about too many things. As if I am boasting of being some sort of know it all. Actual fact is - I am a polymath (look it up) with an IQ over 140 and a lifetime of experience doing high level work in about 18 different job/work environments. I had an interest in, followed up by readings in, or experience working at Bridge, skiing, competitive swimming, astrophysics, technology, metallurgy, radio/TV writing, producing presenting acting, automobiles, literature, speculative fiction, BDSM, photography, movie making, farming, eco-home building, antiques, ice hockey, home and furniture restoration, wooden boats, foreign language translation, swords and fencing, sailing and landscape gardening. You know - the usual stuff. And I do not watch TV.	I remember something funny that happened and start laughing in public. My friends always say ''Dude, what is wrong with you?''
[NSFW] Men, what made you shoot the biggest cum load you ever have?	I was 21, i was fucking the best friend of my little sister (16 yr old sexually ferocious black girl) - was banging away from missionary when she went from gripping my ass with both hands to inserting a finger up my ass - no one had ever done that before - under any circumstance - I came about 2-3 seconds later - i shot the never ending load in that girl. Just a river of jizz.	The last girl I was with, we spent the day in bed. She and I decided to actually test this and continuously get me right up to the point where I came and then back off. We'd fuck, stop and eat, maybe watch tv for a bit and cuddle, and fuck more, rinse and repeat. After about 7 hours of that on and off, she decided she wanted to see just how much I would cum. She was on top and when I came, it shot over both of us and hit the wall above my head about 4 feet over my head, and the rest absolutely coated her back.
What was the most romantic moment you've experienced?	I met a girl outside a nightclub who immediately started making out with me, telling me I was "so fucking fit", grabbing me by the groin and shoving my hand down her shirt. Then offering me a bj in the loos.	My ex and I were sitting on the roof of her house. She was sitting on my lap and we were both staring at the stars. We had been silently staring for a while and for the first time I randomly just said "I love you" really softly. She was ecstatic because she felt the same way but was too nervous to say it. We made out on her roof for like 30 minutes. Probably going to take a while to top that one.
What was the loneliest moment you've experienced?	Days like today. No one to talk to, parents who just don't really care, and a SO who says they love me but really don't. It fucking sucks.	Sitting here responding to this in my empty house while my friends and family are in another city hanging out for the holidays.
How Do You Playfully Annoy Your SO?	She tells me deep, personal secrets about herself, and them I make fun of them. For example, my GF told me that she had a nose job as a kid after getting injured in an accident; I constantly tell her to be careful about her nose because she's got like a million dollars invested in it.	I tell him bedtime stories. I make them up on the spot and they are horrendous. He hates nothing more in the world than my bedtime stories. In his words "your stories sound like a 3 year old telling the details of a fever dream." But I insist on telling them nearly every night. I try and trick him by saying I actually prepared all day and made a plot, but it's a lie. These stories never have a point.
Men who gave a brojob: what is your lifestory?	Never had any experience with a dude, but on my bucket list, I really wanna fuck a tranny that passes off for a woman. Or a trap that looks like a cute girl. Hell I already jerk off to that kinda porn when I get bored with Pornhub or there aren't enough good feet fetish videos to cum to. I head on over to Shemaletube and go to town. Something about fucking a tranny is so scary and thrilling and hot.	Never gave, but let a gay dude suck on it because I was desperate. He also bought me pancakes first. Met at karaoke
How do I get over the dating-is-a-pain-in-the-ass feeling?	Dont-fucking-date. What is it with americans and their obsession around dating?? If it doesn't feel right, don't do it, how complicated is that? Dating is not the only way to meet someone, jesus christ. A lot of people don't meet their SO through active dating, they simply end up in the same context. This grinds my gear something ridiculously.	By reframing it as "meeting people", and focusing on that aspect, independent of outcome. Try to look at it as "maybe I'll meet someone who knows a lot about wine, I've always wanted to know more but I'm too lazy to read up on it". Or "I wonder what this persons last holiday trip was to, I'm looking for some cool destinations". And as other poster say, keep the first date short and more of a meet and greet-- if it becomes more, that's ok, but if it doesn't, that's cool too.
Hey guys. What is your hobby/ an activity you would suggest trying?	really? nobody has said weightlifting? well, mine is just that. there is nothing like pushing your body to the limits, you can make strength and size gains, as well as get a sweet pump. plus your body gets flooded with endorphins	I open up the tripadvisor listings for my city, see an important historical thing that seems interesting and make a day-trip of it. It works on many levels: a) You can actually know of cool things to see in the city when you have out-of-towners visit. b) You learn good dating spots and activities.
If your sexually active girlfriend randomly said "No sex before marriage." What would you do?	Lol. Boy you guys are a long way from emotional maturity that will help you last. Why don't you suggest a little third party counseling? If you're serious about her, I've had some counseling that helped my boyfriend and I skip right passed all that nonsense to the real issues. Poor thing is just insecure and young, and heard some stupid BS that made her have unrealistic expectations of you and/or what a loving relationship requires. She just wants to feel the most special. Find a way to show her she is but is expecting to see it in the wrong way. Good luck ;) you kids	I do not miss dating in my early twenties. Edit: does she also get jealous of the idea of you masturbating?
[NSFW] Men who have paid for a professional massage that ended in a happy ending, what was the experience like?	Professional massage ≠ happy ending I'm in massage school in NY, I can tell you most places that offer happy ending massages are dealing in sex slavery.	Used to live in Okinawa, went to a couple different ones over the course of two years. Honestly, it was like any other retail business. Sometimes you got great service, sometimes you got a shitty massage and refused the handjob. I worked a very physical job and long hours (16 hour days, 30+ days with no time off was regular) at the time, so often just the rubdown and conversation with a good looking girl was worth the $40. Besides, it was nice to know that the girl wasnt some deployed guy's wife, you know?
What quality can one girl have that automatically makes her better than other girls?	Tattoos. On women I just do not like them, it makes women look trashy. I know tattoos are popular these days so I just use them as a filtering device.	Curiosity and some sort of quality that has her up front and forward. A girl that doesn't ask any questions is boring as all hell. It doesn't have to be about me specifically, but about the world and everything regarding anything. Someone that values knowledge and wants to learn. Wanting to learn is also a sign of intelligence. A drive to become better and understand. There is something oddly sexy about learning. Especially science.
What's a harsh truth that every man should learn and accept?	Occam's Razor states that you are the most likely cause of the series of unfortunate events that lead you to your miserable blaming of others or "society" for your unhappiness. You are old and out of touch, the children are not the ones who are wrong.	Nobody cares. 90% of the time, no one will ever even notice you. In the gym, on the job, in the bar. This will liberate you more than you think it might.
In my mid 20s, what books do you recommend for me to read?	Atlas Shrugged, The Road to Serfdom, the art of war, Economics in one lesson, The Law (Bastiat). After that we can go into heavier reading.	I say this every time and I will say it again. East of Eden by John Steinbeck. There are some great recommendations in this thread that I have read, but none of them come even close to the sheer godliness that is East of Eden.
What is something you realize you'll never be able to do?	Fit in with the social cliques. I'm not a social outcast or anything, but I don't really follow the whole, "let's go to parties, get smashed, smoke weed and fuck as many girls as we can" routine. It's just something I can never bring myself to do, no matter how "cool" films try to make it out to be. I'm 18 now, turned so 2 days ago, and if anything, I'm starting to appreciate my individuality more.	Leave the planet. I think space travel, even once commercialized will remain something only the extremely wealthy can partake in.
What makes a woman boring to you?	Lack of passion. About anything. A hobby, a pet, a dead president, I don't care what you care about, but care about something! I've legitimately had women look at me like I asked a trick question upon hearing me say, "So tell me something interesting about yourself."	Inability to flirt back or make jokes back. I give it a while to see if they open up, but if they never do, it's a bad sign. If we're together for a long time, there will be times the only things we can say to each other are jokes or flirty things. They need to be able to play off me or let me play off them. Otherwise it's just not fun.
For those of you who asked for your S.O.'s father for his approval before you proposed, what did you say to him?	This practice is so out of date IMO. Sorry for the off topic answer, but he does not own his daughter. I should probably add that I hate my wife's father...	My father in law likes me a lot and we've always gotten along. We were at a family wedding (wife is Irish catholic, there are a *lot* of family weddings) and I took him aside and said I planned to propose and that I'd like his blessing. He hugged me and said I had it, and not to tell her mother or else everyone in the family would know by the end of the week.
What's the worst thing that you've ever said to your spouse, with no ill intent?	Effectively told her to "get medicated" to help with her anxiety/depression. She doesn't want medication, is afraid it'll change her personality, who she is as a person. I'm in agreement with her. I was referring to something more akin to "a really small dose" to help take the edge off but not affect her personality. But of course it doesn't get heard that way.	What I said: "I'm glad you're not worried about looking pretty like all the other girls I've been with" What I meant: "It's awesome that you're comfortable with yourself and aren't super insecure about not looking your 100% best all the time" What she heard: "You're uglier than the many *many* other girls I've been with but it's cool because I don't have to wait for you to get ready everywhere we go" It went over about as well as you might think...
A woman I had a crush on in high school recently got married and just asked me out for a beer. What's your "The gods are cruel" moment?	The gods aren't cruel, they were looking out for you! The poor man she married is being cheated on. It's a good thing that you didn't marry her. You dodged a bullet.	I've become romantically close to two women in my life, and both times, they decided they liked one of my friends a little better than they liked me
What's the most enjoyable PS1 game that you played?	PS1 was really the last time I played games back in high school. Twisted Metal 2. Resident Evil. Bloody Roar. Parappa the Rapper. Tomb Raider. Darkstalkers. Street Fighter Alpha. Back then I obsessed over game art as much as I did comic book art. But, once I discovered girls and started getting laid, I stopped caring about games. Which was natural. Back then games were intended for kids and teens. Not grown-ups that compared them to movies. It was something you grew out of.	All of the Crash, Spyro and FF games for the PS1 are fantastic. I still replay them every now and again.
Who was the last girl you rejected and why?	There's a girl I'm currently hooking up with but she wants to make it a thing. I'm actually not into her and she's kinda just a confidence boost for me right now. She actually just asked me if we could sit down and talk soon so I figure this is gunna be a conversation about taking things to the next level. I'm gunna say no and probably end things.	She is my [2nd]cousins best friend. They are both barely 14 and I am 35. That whole conversation was awkward AF. 14 year old girls can be uncomfortably forward. Good thing my 1st cousin was there and heard everything and she told me I handled it like a pro.
Dating Question - How old is too old to be living with my parents?	I don't think any age is too old as long as you are having a good living. I think it is plain stupid for someone making peanuts or living paycheck to paycheck to be living off by themselves. Many other countries have their children living with them until they are married. I lived with my parents for 3.5 years after college even though I was making over $160k/year. Granted I also used their other homes along their main estate.	Times are changing in my opinion. Some absurd amount of people high into there 20's still live with their parents. Some because they can't afford to move out because of debt from school and some because they're trying to get ahead and save money. Either way who cares what other people think. I could of moved out a while ago but I'm saving money to buy a condo or small house. Screw renting.
What 'knife under the pillow' security measures are normal behaviour and what are borderline crazy?	I keep a hunting knife and a machete sheathed tucked between my bed and the frame (like so the hilt is out). You never know man. I live in the ghettos. I don't own a gun yet so a knife is the next best thing. Hopefully if I ever have to use it it's just to scare an intruder off. At least where I've home safety is a real thing. Locked doors and windows are easy as balls to unlock with a little know how, and that know how is just a Google search away.	Probably best to not keep a weapon literally under your pillow. Keep it a little farther away so that you can't access it while still half-asleep and irrational. Under the bed, in a drawer nearby, some place you need to get up to reach. In combination with a decent alarm system that should be more than sufficient. I just lock my doors, home invasions are extremely rare around here.
What "percentage" of yourself do you share with your gf/bf? And why is it that much?	Usually almost 0%. It's been a long time since i had a relationship that survived a year. Intimacy takes a long time for me. Probably the last 3-4 relationships i've had were short lived in part because they felt that i never let them in. That's fine with me though, in the end they proved not to be the right people to open up to.	I directly reciprocate the amount shared. Occasionally I will offer something to try and spark some intimacy on some subjects like something about my past or maybe something about the way I am feeling, but this is a rarity. I am a much better responder than I am an offerer when it comes to discussion.
How can i hold off on sex without getting called a tease?	You said it... they are boys. If you're being up front with them and saying sex isn't going to happen, you're not teasing. Even if you don't say this, and you stop before sex happens, you're not teasing. There is no obligation to have sex, even if you're making out like horny teenagers. These guys are being dicks. I'd suggest to just keep being as honest and transparent as you can, and let them deal with their own egos.	First step is probably stop going into dudes' beds and then wondering where the confusion is. Keep that boundary clear. Come in my room you cleaning it for cash or you fucking in it for free. Mention you take things slow and what not right around the time you first kiss the guy. Don't get into heavy makeout sessions, don't let their hands wander too much, and don't take off clothing until you've made the "this isn't leading to sex straight away" part clear. Lastly, quit caring about whether these guys think you're a tease or not. If they don't roll at your speed, they don't. Let them go.
What's the best thing that has happened to you ever and why?	Having my kids. They are the joy of my life. I wasn't sure I wanted kids. Now I'm happy in a way I never even thought was possible.	Going to college. In High School I had shit social skills, never got invited to parties, friends would regularly hang out with each other and "forget" to invite me, that sort of thing. After a month of college I was a campus celebrity. Turns out that when I am invited to parties, I'm the life of the party. I was respected by my professors, admired by my peers, I even got to start a pretty sweet band. It wasn't perfect, I still had a lot of personal issues, but the change was like night and day. I remember going back home and hearing someone I used to know comment on how I used to be all "violin and videogames". Nah dude, you just never gave me a chance to be anything else.
What are some "green flags" to look out for when dating?	There are none. Any good attribute can be faked, or coexist with nasty attributes that make it unworkable. All you can do is keep an eye out for the bad shit *and hope there isn't any hiding beneath a passable facade.	She asks questions back to you when you're talking to them. I've found that girls who don't do that are usually selfish people.
What is the most cringe-worthy thing you have said to a girl?	When my ex and I broke up, with spite he said "these past two years, I could have made you cum so much more if I wanted to but I was just didn't care enough" that was salty	Girl: ugh I have to work early tomorrow Me: oh really where do you work? Girl: ... here She was my co-worker and we were at work . True story.
How do you diffuse your "Nice Guy" thought process?	Don't. Apportion your niceness such that it is equivalent to the level of deservedness of the object of its aim.	Re-frame the situation. You're not a nice guy getting rejected and you shouldn't focus on avoiding becoming a stereotypical 'nice guy'. Instead, you are a good person. Honestly, you are. Everyone can always be better though, so focus your energies on 'how can I be a good person'. This should steer your efforts towards living a fulfilling life. Reading books, studying, exploring the world around you as you go. I believe this is ultimately what will attract the right kinds of people to you, with the caveat that you do these things for yourself, and not in an attempt to impress anyone else. Self love, self confidence, and self direction - these are the ultimate attractors, go get you some.
How put off would you be if you were talking to a girl for ages, you two clicked, and you were really interested, but she eventually revealed she was hearing impaired?	Not sure about Australia but any Americans in this thread should know that here the proper term is hard of hearing, not hearing impaired. Some don't mind it, but others harshly reject the term. :)	If it was so unnoticeable that you had to reveal to me that you were impaired for me to know, then it really doesn't matter to me at all.
what was the final straw that made you realize a girl was just using you?	We were shopping together and she made me go back and return something i bought so she could get some goddamn laptop keyboard stickers.	When I realized that she didn't know a single thing about me, and it wasn't because I hadn't told her, it was because she hadn't listened to me or cared enough to remember what I said.
How much did getting a girlfriend/boyfriend affect your happiness levels?	You shouldn't look on that like that. That's not what love is about. Try focusing on real male and real female friends But getting a guy fuckbuddies who dominate me (after I accepted I am into male submission) cured my depression	Before: 2-3/7 After: 6/7 I don't like that it's like that, but it's undeniable how much an effect having someone there for you has - someone to talk to on a daily basis, someone that cares about how you're feeling, or what you're up to. There's just a time investment that people make in a relationship that outside of a relationship most people don't want to make.
How many bowls of cereal is too many?	Honestly, 1 is too much. Cereal is what I like to call human dog food, it just makes you fat. It's nutritionally worthless and you'd better off eating bacon and eggs.	For me, it's one. A single bowl is all it takes to open Pandora's Box and I awaken in a stupor surrounded by empty boxes of cheerios. I love cereal too much and I cannot be trusted alone with it, so not even once.
How do you feel about women using the the mens restroom when you are out at the Bars?	Go for it. I don't care. Frankly I'm more surprised by the number of men on reddit who are offended that they can't go in the women's bathroom. (People get offended so easily these days /s)	Bothers me on principle. From all the women I know who have done this they are both entitled and hypocritical. They feel they should be allowed in there but men shouldn't be allowed in theirs. In practice I don't care.
What downvoted comment you have written do you stand by 100%?	I said that we should outlaw elective abortions that are not performed for medical reasons. That and the following discussion got me a flurry of downvotes.	Buying someone Omaha Steaks is a decent gift for someone who loves meat. Buying someone twelve pounds of Wagyu from Costco for $900 is fucking ridiculous.
Men, what would you cook for your date?	Idk how to cook, and women have been statistically terrible to me, so I wouldn't want to cook for them anyway.	Oh hey meal requests yeah I can do this > I'll probably make a brocolli purée with goat cheese and walnuts Well shit you're outta my league
How many pillows do you use?	One under my hips and one under my face so I can bite it. Wait, we ARE talking about pegging, right?	Generally two, but some nights I'll take one away if I want to sleep on my chest. I have a third pillow ready if I want to sit up in bed to read.
How often do you buy a new pair of shoes?	About once a year. My sneakers last ~2 years. My running shoes last maybe half a year. My boots get resoled every 2-3 years. My daily wear is either the sneakers or boots depending on weather.	Running shoes, every 3-6 months. Dress shoes, perhaps every 2-3 years? Casual shoes... maybe every 1-2 years. Only my running shoes get significant wear.
What well perceived comedy movies and tv shows really aren't that funny?	Parks and Rec is probably one of the least funniest shows that I have ever seen. Same thing with Community. That show only had 2 decent/funny characters.	I don't find Family Guy that funny at all. To me, it seems they don't even use humor that much. Instead, they rely on references and cutaways. That, and button-pushing...just seeing what they can get away with, trying to shock rather than amuse.
What is the classiest way you've been rejected?	Honestly, I haven't really had any rejections that I would count as "classy." The best rejections I've received have been pretty darn lackluster and mediocre, and the worst rejections have been pretty darn hurtful.	Had an OKCupid date, we had sex, it was pretty good, but nothing crazy (she was very hot, I was very nervous). As I followed up for second date, she said something akin to "So, I was thinking about it and I just don't really think we're a match. You're super cute though. This might sound weird but I'd be happy to set you up with a friend of mine." I declined, but appreciated the up-front-ness.
What made you stay for too long with a person you've already fallen out of love with?	I'm afraid I'm just spoiled and will want out again as soon as I'm in the next relationship. Right now we live together in an expensive area and being separated would make it way more difficult for both of us. I'm guessing the answer for me is to live alone and date around a bit until I find someone who fits but I work from home and know very few people in my city.	Change is difficult. I didn't want to hurt her, as she was a great person. The sex was awesome. All of that, and it made ending the relationship worse. Always best to end it once you're sure.
What's the fastest you've gone from Tinder match getting a face-to-face date?	My last 3 matches have been 2 messages before we start scheduling a date. Usually it takes a bit to find out when and where we are meeting so I don't bother counting those messages. I don't like messaging a lot before meeting because i have a lot of irony based in my speech patterns and that doesn't convey well till after they know me.	A week. Matched, talked for 3 days or so, and I suggested a quick meetup at a coffee shop. That turned into a great 3 hour conversation. She is currently my GF and we've been together for over a year. Others were more in the 1-2 weeks range, but I took it pretty casually. Longest was a month due to geography and scheduling.
Men, how long do you usually last in bed?	I try to knock it out inside of 5 minutes. It gets hard though because it's so easy for me to last a long time. I found that if I got my wife on top of me, with her back towards me and her legs spread while I'm inside her, I can knock it out faster. It helps a lot if she comes once or twice. I like this position because it puts me in control of making her cum faster. The faster she can knock hers out, the faster I can knock mine out. If anything the real question should be how many times you can go in a day. On a perfect weekend I'd like to have a marathon and see who could have more orgasms. I think I could totally win at that one against my wife.	7-8 hours. Maybe closer to 10 hours on weekends, especially in the winter when it's so cold. I hate getting out from under my warm blankets. :(
How jealous do you get in a relationship?	Um, not at all? If a woman is dating me then that means that she wants me more than other men in her life. If she behaves inappropriately with other men then she's not worth keeping around. Being jealous is a waste of time.	I feel like the odd man out here. I get jealous pretty often. I've had problems with it actually, the thing is I think it's apart of my nature. I could pretend I don't get jealous but that would be a lie. Best way to deal with it for me is just ignoring the feeling and realizing that my mind makes thing annoyingly complicated most times and to not listen to it all the time.
What is your infamous "but I meant it as a compliment" moment?	I told my fiancee... "Don't take this the wrong way but I find you stunningly attractive... and it's your worst quality" She's funny, engaging, genius, etc :) She took it the right way!	Wanted to compliment how perfect and clear the skin of a girl I was seeing was. Said "You look like you wear a lot of makeup."
Attn: shy/introverted men. What makes a woman more approachable in your opinion?	I think with all this cat calling and male gaze talk going around guys in general are less likely to initiate a conversation. I'm pretty outgoing and I have a hard time starting a conversation because I don't want to be thought of as sexist, sometimes even if I'm 99% sure she wants to talk.	Let's see, if you insist on being approached rather than approaching yourself, then this is my advice: * Doing things alone - If you're always in a group then you're less likely to be approached by a shy/introverted man because he's more likely to be by himself too. * Being the first to smile - A shy/introverted guy is less likely to be aggressive, so by smiling you signal that you are available to be approached for conversation. * If you are hanging out with a friend or friends, not conversing too loudly or being the "loud one" in the group - Some shy/introverted guys like opposites, but most shy introverts would rather be with someone who seems to have a quiet introspective personality like themselves.
Men with depression, do you date? If so, how do you overcome the negative thoughts while on a date?	Find someone who brightens your day whenever you see them. Like if when you don't feel like getting out of bed and just staying there, drinking and smoking and watching stupid YouTube videos all day, when you decide "fuck life and everyone!", but then you find out that you can meet them so you just crawl out and fight. And you go meet them and the day becomes better. But I'm with bi-polar 2, so I get good moments when it's easier to meet someone that would make me battle my depression days and make them better.	Yes. Communication is the key and telling your SO when you are on your darkest days is a must. I try to overcome them by staying busy and having a "me" session of self-improvement.
What was the worst mind game(s) a girl used on you?	WOW! I just want to say sorry on behalf of all women. Sometimes I think i'm a bit nuts, but then I read this and now I feel like THEE absolute perfect girlfriend in the world!	I had a girl pee all over my clothes once because she was mad at me for not paying enough attention to her. No joke. Sex with her was incredible but she was bat shit crazy and that was the last straw.
Fiancée was amazing until I proposed. Im conflicted. What do I do?	If you are not the type of person who likes to play 'keeping up with the jones/jeffersons/whatever last name' you might want to rethink marrying this chick. I'm not going to say she is going to flip the switch as soon as she know you cant run without legal backlash but I am gonna say i suspect it. the best way to find out is just ask her. I'm not saying she is going to tell you the truth when you ask her but her reaction will tell you everything you need to know.	Everyone's saying dump her but that's dumb. She's stressed because she probably has her idea of a perfect wedding and what she wants is getting in the way of your relationship. I would suggest premarital counseling because the question you really want to ask is whether you're more important than the wedding and that's a delicate question that would benefit from a mutual third party.
How can a sexist man grow out of hating women?	You're not sexist... You were abused. It's perfectly normal to be suspicious of women due to your circumstances. You should definitely see a therapist about this. Cause you're not gonna solve this problem on your own.	You might want to talk to a mental health expert on this one. Because that's a lot of baggage to get over.
What are the worst things about an office job?	I just busted my balls working outside all day dealing with dickheads, and you pansies are complaining about a few meetings and some minor shoulder pain? Take a stretch and revel that you are shielded from weather and grinding physical work, not to mention the various health hazards.	Meetings Pointless bullshit HR compliance tasks Sitting in front of a computer for 8 hrs Shitty colleagues That's about everything haha
What feels better than a blowjob?	Sex, a cold drink after a hard day of work. Finally landing that skateboard trick you've been going at for days. A lot, there's more to life you know.	I don't know if you've ever had a hard cast on for a prolonged period of time for a broken bone. After a certain point it becomes a test of your willpower to endure the itchiness and discomfort of the damned thing. When it's taken off though? You think itching the previously restrained appendage is nice? Try sticking it in a warm shower and THEN itching it. Sweet merciful Jesus, I did this with a previously casted leg and had what I can only describe as a "leg orgasm." It's disgusting, dead skin and hair just peel off everywhere but you can't stop because it feels like being massaged by angels.
Guys who turned their lives around/started late, what's your story or advice for fellow guys in that situation?	I was in a similar situation as you, I finally realized that this way of living was unacceptable and I had to change. I went back to school and started to change my ways slowly but surely. Waking up early trying to exercise not speaking to my negative parent who had no idea how the world works and trying to surround myself with more positively thinking people. A change of environment can work wonders, I would recommend moving out tbh your dad and his gf aren't doing you any favors and are most likely preventing from reaching your full potential with their negative talks and lack of support, that is a recipe for failure. Just get away bro.	Wow you're probably gonna hate me after this reply but it sounds like you're not even trying. It seems like you are placing blame on others as well. Your family helped you get a car and they are letting you live with them. You bet your ass you better put away that ONE spoon in the sink. As far as going to school, you are already having doubts. How can you go back to school if you are under the impression that it's not going to help you in the first place? Change your attitude, OP. If you are going to bag groceries at minimum wage you better be the best dam good grocery bagger out there. A strong work ethic takes zero skill.
Which videogame was the biggest let-down for you?	Skyrim. I'd never played an Elder Scrolls game but people kept raving about it so kuch that I picked it up. Looks bad, plays bad, has trash voice acting, boring quests, and a bland story. That's not even mentioning the technical issues...	The new Star Wars Battlefront by EA. Grew up playin I and II and the new one had 0 campaign and very few maps. I've heard it was improved a bit through DLCs but I can't imagine it's anywhere near the originals Edit: wow this got lots of attention! Honestly if they just remade BF 2 and threw in a multiplayer I would have been more than satisfied
What is something really insignificant to a bystander but can really fuck up your day?	Driving past bikers. They're on their way to working out their legs, while obscuring the road and increasing the chances of an accident.	A few days after shaving your junk and you get that "itchy phase" where if your junk isn't perfectly placed, it'll be the most uncomfortable thing all day. Constantly rearranging.
Guys who cut their arsehair, what's your technique?	I'm betting this is a very small percentage of the male population, most of whom are in the porn business. Still, I'll be checking back here just for the entertainment!	Hair clippers or beard trimmer. The real pro tip is to sit on the toilet facing the tank, all the hair falls into the bowl
How does your profession affect your personality?	I'm a teacher and the son of a teacher. I can't help but correct people. If you've watched How I Met Your Mother, in kind of a Ted Mosby, minus the passion for architecture.	I work in legal, so I tend to be very careful with how I word things. I try to avoid statements of absolutes. Conversely, I tend to pick apart the words of others and try to "lawyer" them in my mind. I generally will recognize what I'm doing and snap out of it, but it's just how I'm wired now.
Guys who have dated girls who smoke weed regularly, what was your experience?	Dude, what, smoking makes no difference really. She'll probably find tv shows more funny than you do. I'm a smoker, I've dated and created smokers, it makes no difference.	She was really cool. Sort of a hippie, but cool as hell. Do yourselves a favour -- keep healthy snacks around the house. Pineapple, kiwi, oranges...and some junk food too, just in case. If you give a stoner a snack, you've a friend for life!
[Meta] How do you feel about having an Apache helicopter as an option in the gender flairs?	It was a stupid fucking joke in the first place used to mock transgender people at about a fourth grade level of discourse, and I have zero respect or toleration for anyone who ever thought it was funny.	Honestly, since this is askmen I wouldn't mind if there was just "male" and "not-male", makes sense to me, come at me. It's either the target demographic or it isn't. The difference between female and agender really shouldn't matter much on this sub. What is "bane" anyway?
Men, how do you deal with knowing potential SO is still friends with ex?	The top comment is such insecure pathetic bullshit. If he's a man and not a boy he'll just get over it, or not care to begin with. Adults maintain friendships with former partners all the time. Hell, my aunt is good friends (as is my whole family, his son is one of my best friends) with a guy she was MARRIED to decades ago. EDIT: You never fail to disappoint me with your fragile egos and paranoia, r/askmen	I'll contrast two women I date/d who maintained friendships with exes. Ex girlfriend was prone to severe attention seeking behaviour. She maintained friendships with one night stands. I didn't like it because it did not paint a picture of what a faithful committed relationship was like. She told me I was jealous and controlling. We broke up because she weaponized my feelings against me and tried to say the same to our social circle. All but two of the people in the social circle knew her to use sex as social currency. Current girlfriend was friends with some of her exes, doesn't actively seek attention from them. The biggest difference? The moment he showed disrespect for our relationship she told him to pound sand. Adults can talk about their feelings. Adults can respect their partner's feelings.
Have you ever lost attraction to a good looking woman because of something she did or said?? What happened?	I had a female best friend for about 2 years at the end of high school that was fairly attractive. I had no interest in her at the time but she went out of her way to hardcore friendzone me for about 6 months. (remember I had no interest) It pissed me off and stopped any attraction I had for her. At the end of our friendship, she started getting feelings for me and i didn't care at all anymore and turned her down because of it.	First date. Early in the date, she said her boss was driving her crazy. I didn't think much of it. A few beers later, she says that her boss keeps asking her out. I think, hmmm that's a lot of baggage but not really her fault necessarily. We go to my house, and she mentions that she sleeps with her boss regularly. Uhhhh...nope.
How often do you get told to smile?	Too often. It's kinda hard because my face easily disconnects from my emotions and false attempts make me look off.	My mom says it occasionally. Otherwise never, nobody walks around the production floor or the gym with a silly grin all day.
How important are political beliefs to you when trying to find a girlfriend?	I honestly don't give a fuck about politics, but I could never date a girl that doesn't like guns. Unfortunately, that essentially excludes me from dating 99% of Democrats.	So you're saying you want to seize his means of production OP? In any case I don't really care as long as you're not an extremist on either end of the spectrum and can have a discussion about politics without getting mad.
Men who are successful with online dating HOOKUPS, what does your dialogue look like?	I used to use a bot to message all the women on whatever site I was trolling for pussy. Then I'd set up meets with all the girls who were both local and could attract me. Maybe 3 or 4 would be honestly representing themselves rather than fat whales. 1 or 2 would be interested in a relationship or fucking and not just having me buy them stuff. Meh...I'm married to a young hottie now so I don't have to worry about it anymore.	Online hook ups are 90% looks, 10% sealing the deal. If you dont have the looks you'll have more success in real life.
What are some social situations were you would rather want to be treated like a person of the opposite sex?	Treated as if I were a woman or for women to act towards me the way men act towards women?	Moving day. Would be great if all my female friends who are secretly hoping to hookup with me would come out of the woodwork and help me move furniture.
What misconceptions about male sexuality would you want to clear up for a young teenage boy?	Sex and gender are linked. Stay off Tumblr; no one there has any grasp of basic human biology, medical fact, and common sense. One cannot change sex or into anything else simply by 'thinking' really hard. Anything outside the norm is abnormal. No it doesn't mean you'll be hunted down for 'rehabilitation'. If you're a boy who likes boys, fine. If you're a girl who likes girls fine. If you like both, there's problem. You cannot give your 'feeling's to two people in the same amount. You will find preference of one over the other. As scary as it may sound, your family is your best support. Friends could be a close second, but opening up to them over your family is hurtful.	Your friends are, with 99% certainty, **not** having as much sex as they say they are. The median lifetime number of partners is 6ish. A few get a lot more, most do not. Just chill out and don't worry about notches on your bedpost.
You just won the lottery and never have to work again, but you're bored and want to. What job do you do or business do you start?	Puppy, hedgehog and bear breeder. That or I'd invest it all in the research to bring back dinos. Buy and island and build a lab there	A bar where I'm shitfaced all the time and belligerent to the other patrons But SUPER cheap drinks so people always come
What's the most bro thing a teacher has done for you?	My eighth grade social studies teacher booked this ugly fucking dweeb in the middle of class one day cause he'd seen a bunch of other students do it. The whole class thought it was hilarious. Took me fifteen minutes to put my trapper keeper back together.	When I was set to graduate, I discovered they had changed the requirements and I had a missing credit. It was a simple class I had already taken the advanced one. I went to my teacher to find out how to get that credit. He rolled his eyes and said it would be a waste of my time, He went to the dean and said he would vouch for me that I knew it. They just gave me the class credit so I could graduate.
How did your parents marriage affect your views on marriage?	At some point around my birth, they randomly fell out of love and Dad began cheating. I don't want to get married. People change, and there is nothing romantic about a legal contract	I learned that I will never go for an arranged marriage, and will instead search for a partner that I truly love and adore myself. I also learned that compromise is key- all arguments between my parents don't end sooner than they should because neither of them will ever admit they can be wrong. Having grown up with a verbally and emotionally abusive mother, I'm so scared to form an emotional attachment to a woman. I grew up with 18 years of being told I was never, ever, ever good enough no matter what I achieved, and that I will always be singled out for what I failed to achieve instead. That I'm nothing more than a distracted idiot who will end up homeless on the streets. :(
What are some embarrassing, would-be-totally-creepy-if-they-knew things you've done while crushing on someone?	Did bad things to myself while looking at their picture... Looked then up on facebook but I don't add them or anything.	I was friends with her a while back and we had a falling out and recently I've been going back to her tumblr and finding posts that may or may not be about me and trying to decrypt them. It's horrible. I just want her out of my head
Guys with SO addicted to their phone, how do you handle it?	So I'm reading your replies, and it sounds like you guys are hanging around the house, and she is on the phone, and it bothers you. Get over it. It would be one thing if she can't go through dinner without pulling it out, but relaxing at home? She is not required to pay attention to you 24/7. Watching TV is not a social activity, despite what you may think. Leave her be.	We didn't get our first smartphones until after we had been married for a while, and we both went a little overboard at first until I took a step back and realized that not only was she be unreasonable, but so was I. So I just told her, "Hey, Cat, I know I've been neglecting you in favor of this piece of shit, but I've been feeling neglected too. Can we talk about this and work it out?"
Have you ever approached an attractive stranger in public? What did you say and how did it go?	I remember I had one to many beers with my friend at a bar and there was a group of girls are ranging from attractive to meh. But with liquid courage inside of me, something told me I need to make their day, even if I didn't make their day I went up to them anyways. "Hey, all you ladies, you are all beautiful individuals, and no matter what anyone says, I think you're gorgeous" And walked away, they probably thought I was really weird or knew I was drunk, but I did and only to tell them they were pretty and walk away.	Yep! Cute Girl on the 6th floor of the library, saw her like everyday for like TWO MONTHS straight and occasionally we'd make awkward eye-contact. One day I had been listening to more Young Thug than usual and was like fuck it and cornered her in the elevator and awkwardly asked her for her number. BAM like 4 weeks later I'm typing this from one of the couches up on the 6th Floor and Cute Library Girl is sitting right next to me *wearing my jacket* haha nice
What's the WORST piece of advice you've heard on Reddit?	"My boyfriend said something the other day that irked me. It wasn't a big deal but I don't know what to do. Am I overreacting?" "***YOU AREN'T. DUMP HIM AND MOVE ON. YOU OWE NO ONE ANYTHING AND SHOULD STAND UP FOR YOURSELF. BURN ALL YOUR BRIDGES NOW SO THAT YOU CAN FINALLY BE AN ADULT.***" "Thanks! I hadn't seen things that way!"	There's the legal advice thread where someone told the OP to go around and talk to as many lawyers as possible about their divorce so that their spouse couldn't find an impartial lawyer. Which is apparently illegal (or makes you responsible for some kind of damages).
Fellas, what is your relationship with your Dad like?	I don't know how to put it into words, but killing him with my bare hands would bring me soooooooooo much fucking joy. I'd look him right in the fucking eyes, tell him IM the reason his life is ending, and watch that light fade. I fucking despise that piece of shit.	Excellent, He raised me as a single parent since my mother died when I was just 2 months old and as cheesy as it may sound he's my hero, my mentor and one of my best friends.
My father cheated on my mother with a much younger woman so how do I explain to my brothers?	I do hope your entire family completely cuts off all contact with him. Cheaters do not deserve the affection produced by their children. I do hope you and your brothers begin to resent him. His everlasting punishment for his deeds will be never being allowed to talk to his own children. I can't think of a worse pain than to be excommunicated by your own kid.	> Heck, can't understand why my father would do such a thing... Key issue right there. Yet, you plan to explain it to your brothers. Sounds like you're not the right person to do this.
A girl I've been talking to recently told me she still has feelings for a guy she used to see who cheated on her multiple times. What do I do?	Just be careful. It's possible after that after she chooses him(if) that she might come back later. Don't hold your breath, but it is semi possible	Cut her off. You deserve 100% from someone. You can't expect that from someone that has feels for someone else. It sucks, but you'll be better off spending time looking for someone that can dedicate herself to you.
How do you feel about "Women Only" events and businesses?	Do you think a a Men Only business or event would be successful? I think this was also known as History.	I feel in two minds about a lot of things. On the one hand I see the need for a place to be able to do the stuff you want to do without having to deal with flirting and ogling guys. On the other hand exclusion is one of those things that rubs me the wrong way, because it is a one sided thing as there would be a massive problem if people made a man only yoga studio or gym which clashes with the wish for equality between everyone. So I've decided the subject is too nuanced for me to actually care that much because women having their own place doesn't hurt anyone and it pretty much devolves into a non-issue the more I think about it.
What's the most random missed connection you've had with a girl?	I worked at H&M in a big shopping mall for a short period when I was like a freshman in college. The chicks that I worked with would browse the missed connections section of craigslist. One day when I came in for my shift like 3 of these chicks ambushed me and showed me a missed connection post that someone made online that described me to a t. I followed up on the post and actually met the chick in person for coffee but she turned out to be fat so I didn't pursue anything further.	At a bar in Manhattan drinking with friends, random girl walks up to me and says, "excuse me, you are very good looking." "Awe, thank you!" I say, as if she were 12 and just complimented my shoes. An awkward silence and she walks away. I didn't realize until my friends told me that she was probably flirting. Now, six year later, I think, "probably?!!" I've never been so flirted with in my life and I was clueless.
What fantasy did you share with your SO that shut your relationship down? Or, what fantasy did your SO have that made you nope the fuck out?	Apparently not wanting kids was a fantasy. I called it good judgement. Relationship didn't last much longer. The next one had wedding fever. $10,000 dress, white ponies or some shit. No way. A wedding shouldn't cost more than a grand or two, anything else is just a waste of money. Insult to injury, I am not getting married to anyone. So that relationship went nowhere as well.	Not a SO but a fuck buddy. He told me he was seriously into pain, like black-out level pain. He loved that it made him feel like an animal. A while back, while out in the woods a stray bullet went through the outside of his thigh. I asked him a few days later how the wound was healing up. He said it was infected. I asked why and he said it was because he'd jerk off and finger fuck his bullet hole. Haven't hooked up with him since.
Fellow Men what feminine traits or interests do you have that you tend not to share to fellow blokes?	I'm a fucking huge hip hop head, but Avril Lavigne is bae. Also, I enjoy shopping for clothes, spend a lot of time trying things on and take quite a bit of time in the morning to look good. I suppose I only really hide the 1st one.	I almost always sit down to pee. I live alone, so who's gonna know? Plus it gives me a chance to check my phone without worrying about dropping it in the toilet.
Are you ok with your SO talking/texting with her ex? What if you found out she was doing it and didn't tell you?	I don't care. People have friends, and for some people, that includes someone they dated. She's with me and not her ex because she wants to be with me and not her ex.	There are not many good reasons why you still need to be in contact with your ex. If she somehow has good reasons and informs me of them, fine. If she's been doing it behind my back, not fine.
In hindsight, what was your biggest missed opportunity in life?	Maybe not my biggest missed opportunity, but i definitely think about it. I was walking across campus to class, and I crossed paths with a super cute girl who smiled and said hi to me. I said hi and kept walking to class. I sit down and realize I am an idiot. Maybe she was just being friendly maybe she also thought i was cute and I should have got her number. Guess I will never know.	Selling my ~3000 bitcoins when they were ~8 cents a piece (had just risen 1000% in like 4 days or something). I don't want to look but I think they are over 1000 bucks each now.
For men who've dated girls significantly taller than them, what was that like?	I always had an erection when she started to kiss me abruptly because I am sexually submissive so all our interaction was subby to me	It's really no big deal. Negatives: You have to stand on your toes to kiss her. Positives: You can look at her breasts all night and it doesn't look creepy. Yeah, that's about it.
Guys, what is your SO flaw that someone outside your relationship would see as a red flag?	Well my girlfriend is Mexican, so there are a bunch of backwards Americans right now that would call that a red flag. Luckily we live in Canada.	I've lost friendships over this one. Before I do anything, I check in with him. Not in a permission kind of way, but in a "hey I want to do this with X, can we afford to/is that cool?" Because sometimes he had something planned for us that night, or he had a hard day and needs me around to help him decompress or whatever reason. And in the beginning of our relationship we were dirt poor and sometimes we couldn't afford to do stuff. Apparently this makes him abusive and controlling. But he checks in with me before he does anything too. I think it's just relationship common courtesy but whatevs.
Fit men of askmen, what are you eating today?	You don't need to eat healthy to maintain your weight. Maintaining is easy. Most fit only eat semi healthy unless you're eating for performance purposes. Losing weight? Completely different story.	Had oatmeal with berries this AM. Eating some almonds and walnuts at the moment. Lunch will be chicken and veggies. Dinner will be tilapia and stir fried veggies with a glass of wine.
Whats a good story you have that you can't really tell your friends in real life?	That I love sleeping with Pre-op Trans Woman. Blowing them is a lot of fun. If I tell them, then they'll assume I'm gay and I'm not into dudes at all. I've tried it, not my thing. Edit: So many typos	Dani Daniels took my glasses off my face, put them between her ass cheeks, rub them on her pussy, licked them, then put them back on my face. Quite the experience.
Guys who went from being unnoticed by women to being extremely noticed - what did you change?	Be social! Just talk to people. Walk with your head up and your shoulders back. Dress well. Get a real haircut and fix your hair. Every. Day.	I mean I'm not *extremely* noticed, but women do notice me now, I basically started caring for how I look, my posture (back straight chest out head UP) and I become more confident with experience.
I'm turning 21 in thirty minutes and I'm stuck at the doctor's with strep throat. What did you guys do for your 21st birthday?	Went to a bar with like 100 friends, got blackout in 45 minutes, puked on a jeep and woke up in nothing but jeans face down on a hardwood floor. Good times. Edit: why the down vote?	I bought a sixpack of Sierra Nevada and drank one. I had work the next morning. That weekend, my roommate and two of my sergeants brought me to the casino and got wasted. I ended up being the sober one. My roommate barfed in my car. I won $210 at blackjack.
What is it about that "one guy" in your friend group that you can't stand?	Nice Guy syndrome. 'Poor people should just work harder' even though when his parents cut him off he depended on everyone else for food, housing, and transportation to survive university. 'The woman in Rum Diaries deserved to get raped because that's what happens when white women hang around blacks'. 'The woman in Irreversible deserved to get raped because she didn't listen to her boyfriend.' Just a general lack of self awareness and social skills. Love the guy though.	He was a good friend of a guy I consider one of my best friends. They'd been friends since elementary school. I always thought he was a douchebag, and didn't give a rats ass about anyone but himself. Well, my best friend's wife walked out on him for reasons that boiled down to her not being happy. Best friend told old school friend to stay away from her for a while, hoping that she'd come back. Turns out old school friend was after her from before she left. Last I knew they were shacking up together. If I came across them burning in a car fire, I wouldn't so much as drink a beer to work up enough piss to urinate on them to put them out.
What are your tips for asking a girl out?	Usually I just sniff my anus at a 45 degree angle, making sure to confer with my friends on the acidity of the smell, if it checks out then I grease my hair back, take two steps forward, three steps back, and ask the girl out while tipping my fedora and saying, "M'lady"	* Use the word DATE unless you want to always wonder if she thinks its a date or just a hang out. End the confusion before it begins. * Have a specific time and date in mind. Don't just leave it out there. "Hey, I'd like to take you on a date to {place} this Friday. It'll be fun!"
If a date is late, when is it socially acceptable to leave?	If they don't show after 15-20 minutes I'm on my way to the other date I booked in that timeslot.	As a rule, I do half-hour no call, no show. If it's half an hour since we agreed to meet, and you have made no attempts to contact me, this is a horrendous waste of my time for something that you honestly weren't that interested in.
What is your BIGGEST sexual insecurity?	My bedroom doesn't have a dimmer switch so it's impossible to get the lighting right unless I turn on the tv with the lights off. But I don't have a remote for my tv so it's awkward.	I read an article that said 5 inches was average penis size so I decided to break out the ruler. Worst mistake of my life.
When a girl is riding you, what are you supposed to do?	Talk dirty and grab her hair kiss her face spank her ass. Ask her if she likes your cock. Say you're my little slut aren't you? Then say my turn slut and grab her ass and pump into her. lick her nipples and stare into her eyes slap her face lightly.	Don't just lie there like a lifeless toy. Interact with her, be affectionate, be playful, let her know how good it feels. Caress as much of her as you can reach. Grab the sides of her hips and hold her down on you for a moment. Pull her close and give her a big ol' hug. Kiss her and play with her hair. Play with her hands and kiss her hands; or simply hold them for a bit. Let your voice out for her. There's a lot of things to do, there's a living, breathing *woman* on top of you, not a block of ice.
Divorced men, What are some things to keep in mind before getting married?	that if things don't work out and end in Divorce, you have no idea how bad the entire process is biased against you. The short version is you will stand to lose everything (children, house, retirement, toys, etc.), while all she really stands to lose is the pleasure of your company. Divorce tends to turn a man into an indentured servant. She may not know or want that now, but years after watching her friends do it and laugh about it during wine night, it will at min. change the dynamic in your relationship	Marriage will not change your spose for the better. It's not a solution to any problem. If there is a mismatch with libido then misery follows. When sex is good it is 25% of the relationship. But when sex is bad it can become 75%.
Men, How do I deal with my gf's guy bestfriend who liked each other once?	I don't believe guys and girls can be best friends after liking each other. There's history and sexual tension there. All it needs is a bit of alcohol and he'll be balls deep one day and then you walk in the door. It sucks bro, but it's the reality.	I became friends with the guy. He is really cool and we actually get along quite good. We've been talking our experiences with her and there's no hard feelings from my side of the story. He might hate my guts for all I know but I like him and he is open about the relationship they had.
What is the biggest age gap in a relationship that you know of and how are the couple now?	Biggest age gap was with me (F18) and my ex (M42). He was abusive and incredibly controlling. Broke up in four months. Currently with a 32 year old. Going on seven months, he's immature but stable. I'm mature but anxious/depressed. Works for us.	My cousin is 28 and his girlfriend is 61. They met while he was bartending, she owned the bar and was a widow. They have been dating 4 years it's really awkward at family get together and social gatherings. He is a two time felon and I am constantly wondering how awesome the ending of this relationship will be.
I am misogynistic but i don't want to be. How do i change my subconscious views on women?	First things first: forgive your mom and forgive yourself. If any part of you relates your mom to *all women* then any progress you make will only be backtracked at some point. What your mom did give you is clear warning markers on the kinds of behavior that you want to avoid in *anyone*, not just women.	"...my single mother who was very abusive towards me." You've got to repair that damage with a therapist as soon as possible. What you're experiencing now is only one symptom.
what is something that genuinely scares you?	that i kill myself 40+ hours a week just for the government to steal a 1/3 of it from me. that means i work at least 13.3 hours for nothing a week. i would rather have that time to myself.	Being unwanted, alone, abandoned. Not amounting to shit in life. Disappointing my family and myself. Basically failing in general. But like really failing. Only issue is i dont know what is consider true and utter failure.
Hetero men: how do you feel about the expectation to buy your SO an engagement ring?	I find it ironic and that women still demand certain traditions while running away from most others while crying oppression.	I think they're expensive and fairly pointless trinkets, but my wife likes them so I buy them. I'm sure she buys all kinds of crap for me that she considers equally silly.
Single guys who live alone, what is your life like?	A lot of the reasoning in this thread is pretty damn pathetic. "I can sleep as late as I want..." What?	When I'm in a relationship it's great, because it provides a great place to hang out, have sex, etc, and also a buffer when you need space and want to be alone. For your question, when I'm single (which I am now), it can get very lonely in a hurry if you let it. You have to fill your social calendar. Meet with friends and family at least 3-4 times a week. I play basketball once a week, coach youth sports, and hit the gym 5 times a week. I always text friends to hang out, and I visit my parents at least once a week. If you don't do these things, you will find yourself on the couch watching netflix most of the time and you will be alone with your thoughts a lot. You have to keep busy.
What do you think can be done to help low self esteem and insecurity in men?	Acknowledge that men suffer from problems just like women do. I don't mean turn issues about women into issues about men through hijacking them, I mean admitting that men have issues alongside women. Men have issues with body image, homelessness, low self-esteem, mental illness etc. and they should be treated seriously when discussed in the news. We should stop trivialising men's issues just because we have typically been the more privileged sex.	When you go under let's say for example Instagram: Woman posts a selfie or a butt pic-->Several likes. Compliments from both men and women. "You are beautiful" etc Male posts selfie-->fewer likes. Less to no compliments. Some compliments from men-almost none from women. It appears men don't get much social support which may contribute to any low self-esteem or insecurity.
What do we do, that women don't know we do?	SOME women are shocked to find that "watching 1 hour of porn every day" is pretty normal for men. Even the women that watch porn themselves.	The common perception is that men talk about their sexual exploitations freely with their friends, while women are more modest about theirs. I've found the exact opposite to be true.
What's a common belief about dating/relationships that make you think "well I must have missed the memo, because my experience is totally different"?	The belief that it's important to have sex early on in order to ensure that you're "sexually compatible." Sexual compatibility is real, but its importance is vastly overstated--at least on reddit. If a man and woman love each other and want to make each other happy, they'll usually be sexually compatible. We're not sexual jigsaw puzzle pieces that can only fit into rare shapes.	3-5 day rule for texting/calling. If I like her, she's getting a text from the taxi before I'm even home, and if she likes me, she'll be glad to hear from me.
How often do you take "Mental health Days" off from work?	Never. I call in sick maybe 2-3 times a year because I'm actually sick. I've probably called in sick to a job about 10x in my entire life, the whole "personal day" thing doesn't sit right with me, I've always felt a pretty strong sense of duty. Now that I'm in health care I know that calling in sick might screw over my coworkers if they can't cover my shift, which in turn makes everyone have a shitty day. Edit: "Calling in sick" when actually sick is obviously warranted. "Calling in sick" when I'm not sick and just want a personal day, as the thread title suggests: no, I don't do that, it would feel dishonest and wrong to me and it's not something I do.	I get paid by the hour so I'll take a day off when they force me or when I die
Victims of child abuse: What happened and how are you now?	Victim of childhood sex abuse: I repressed all the memories until about seven months ago when I finally quit drinking after 20 years as an alcoholic. All the memories and emotions came flooding back, some in vivid flashbacks. I'm still processing it all with a therapist. I've struggled with depression since adolescence, and now I can add anxiety and PTSD to that mix. As bad as it sounds, I'm doing pretty good though. Good days and bad. At least I'm sober and learning to deal with life on life's terms.	My brothers father used to treat me not-so-great the year or so we lived with him. I was around 8-9 and would wet the bed every so often and when he got home from work in the early morning around 2 or 3am he'd pull me out of bed and have me handwash my sheets while standing behind me saying how dirty I was. He'd 'teach' me self-defence where he'd put me in a painful hold and not let me go until I was in tears begging him to let go... Stuff like that. I'm 26 now and still find it hard to trust older men. Edit; Thank you kind stranger for the gild, and to those that replied to my comment. It means a lot to be heard.
How the hell do I go to a club and do it right?	Every time I've had fun at a club there were three main ingredients. 1. Go with a group of good friends 2. Bring a girl, I know clubs are supposed to be places to get women. But it's very loud and women are so guarded in clubs I've found it's easier to just bring your own. 3. Drink enough alcohol to allow yourself to go crazy on the dance floor. If that's one drink so be it, I need several.	you go in with some people, get absolutely wrecked, dance like an idiot and talk to everyone you bump in to at the bar etc then you've either hooked up with someone with your slick moves or you're throwing up down the street
What do you do when you're not really sexually attracted to a potential SO/wife, but in all other aspects she is perfect for you?	What the fuck kind of a question is this? Do you want to have sex with the person you marry? Yes? Case closed. Fuck off with this stupid bullshit	Why not just have a cool friend? If you don't want to sleep with her, don't. Problem solved. You are absolutely right, physical attraction is important. Nothing wrong with not being attracted to someone.
What's something difficult to accept about life as a man, that all men should?	You'll always have to be cautious with how you approach women. If you take a wrong step, you could end up in a lawsuit that's fated to screw you. Won't happen to most of us, because most will be cautious just in case	I once saw a video about how Camus thought that the best way to avoid misery is to accept that life is absurd and to find meaning within the absurd is the path to satisfaction. Or maybe it was a perfume ad, I'm not entirely sure.
how to avoid being the nice guy?	"I am not entitled to sex just because I think I am a decent human being" (spoilers, everyone thinks they're a decent human being) Repeat this phrase as nescessary	Don't be a fucking incel and be a decent human being. Girls like guys who are nice, but not guys who expect a reward for being nice.
Former ugly men of Reddit, how did you clean up?	If you can "clean up" you were never ugly in the first place. What a stupid question from a guy that supposedly listens to Bach.	Honestly not sure if I am or ever was ugly, but I started shaving, take more showers, and change my pillow cases more often to keep my face clean. Also started getting haircuts more often to keep my hair looking nicer. Even though I'm not overweight, very little of my weight is muscle so I cut back on calories, once I lose enough I'll stop cutting and try to put more muscle on. Seems to be working well, I think I look better so far.
What are some common "millennial problems" that you can't understand or relate to?	I dont understand or believe the people that say they cant get a job that pays more than minimum wage. My gf got a minimum wage job and got a $1.5 raise within the year, and she has applied for insurance jobs and has already gotten 3/4 interviews. They pay $12-15. You can get a job that pays more than minimum wage, it just may not be at the place youre at now. You'll have to man up and leave familiarity.	I'm a millennial, and I can't relate to most of the problems non-millennials think we have, or the reasons they think we have them.
Men of Reddit, Did you ever get out from a manipulative relationship? if Yes, how did you do it?	First you have to pull you dick out. Then find some place to put it in where you will be more comfortable. Then tell her your seeing someone else and she should get on with her life. Tears will flow accusations will be made and you will walk free. then get rid of the second place. Now after a few months you will have some idea of what you really want.	My old roommate and good friend was in a very manipulative relationship. Won't go into the details, but it was almost depressing to watch. He moved across the country for a job and didn't bring her. I miss him, but he's finally free.
What are some common "Boomer" Advice/Tactics that just don't work anymore?	This sounds like less of a "boomer generation" problem and more like a "your parents are kind of shitty" problem.	"Go down to the company and hand them your CV." Loads of places don't even accept CVs and want you to fill out a ten page application form, undergo a psychometric test, do an arithmetic test and a situational-awareness test just to even be considered for a ten minute phone interview. It's an employer's market these days and they will make you jump through hoops for even the smallest position in their company if they can.
I know it's unhealthy but do you guys ever hold in your emotions to avoid an argument with your SO? Why?	It really depends on the argument. Sometimes I want to be calm and collected when discussing something serious. Acting on my feelings would only make my SO shut down and we wouldn't get anywhere. Other times I let every emotion I am feeling show. Because he needs to see how something has affected me. My SO almost always holds in his emotions. But he was taught to. He grew up and his parents never gave a single thought to his feelings or made him feel bad for having them. So he learned showing emotion is pointless. He's getting better about it.	All the time. Sometimes I overreact if I run away with my emotions, so I generally take a couple deep breaths, press it down, and unless it still bothers me later, I just let it go. Not all fights are worth fighting.
What is a trait that makes you instantly dislike a person you are conversing with?	When someone stops talking to me to answer their phone, and I can tell they're annoyed at the person for calling. **The sound of a phone ringing does not constitute a requirement to answer**. You can let it go to voicemail and not interrupt our conversation.	People who talk at you instead of having a conversation. They only want to be heard and never seek to hear. They can be on a roll pontificating about whatever they are going on about, you can say, "I dress my penis like a tycoon from the 1920s" and they will go on like you haven't said anything. You realize after you have gotten away from them that they probably don't even know your name because they never even cared enough to ask.
How have women tried to pressure you into making a relationship more serious?	Suggesting cohabiting, talking about future kids (I let people know before we date that there won't be kids nor cohabiting). Pushing for me to want more than there is or acting like I'm a git for not wanting more when they do... I've an "ex" (we end out for a couple of months but weren't official) that was long distance. She asks me once, totally casually: "How often do you want to see each other?" Me: Every 3-4 weeks would be fine. HER: THAT'S NOT ENOUGH!!! She gets pissy and we have this weird conversation, and she eventually writes me this letter that includes, "What have we even been doing for the last month?!?" For me, the pressure tends to show up in them getting upset that I'm not where they are emotionally. EDIT: Typos	By being such an amazing, compassionate partner in my life, I couldn't help but want to spend the rest of my life with her. Crafty bitch, using her evil tricks of caring about and supporting me to trick me into giving up being single.
What exactly is your strategy when eating pussy? Lick it like an ice cream? Stick your tongue as far as possible?	imagine you're bobbing for apples. but the water is bread dough and the apple is right at the bottom. just headbutt it and it'll work out.	I actually start off kissing it, softly blowing warm breaths, gentle probes with my tongue to warm her up. Once she flowing, I do what you said.
What is the worst way autocorrect has ducked you over?	I've sent things to my SO before, and I know I've trusted autocorrect too much when I get "????" in return. There have been times I've had to re-type the whole conversation before because I just trusted the phone. Those times are becoming much less often. LOL, Sorry Love, I'm working on it!	The worst one - that I think is funny - was when I texted my kid sister thanking her for a birthday card. Autocorrect somehow took "thanks for the birthday card" to "thanks for the BDSM card"
You just won $1B. What's the most badass way you can quit your job you can think?	I don't have a job as I'm still in school and haven't invested in any part-time vacancies... but even so. (*This is probably going to sound wayyyyy over-the top haha!*) If this happened to me in the future, I'd crash a window in the building, then call for a helicopter to fly in line with the floor level. I'd then call for my boss, who'd hopefully have his jaw strung open like a cat watching a mysterious ball of fluff floating in the air, and throw him my resignation papers, shaking his hand. Then, I'd do an eagle call and jump through the window into the helicopter as it flies off, with a boombox blasting some gangsta-ass music. I'm such a DAYDREAMING loon. :D	I clean at my dad's business. I would give him a couple million dollars so that he can retire I suppose, making me redundant
I'm going to college at the ripe old age of 23, what are some tips, tricks and do's and dont's that I should be aware of?	I can't tell you what I learned from school But I could tell you a story or two Um yea of course I learned some rules Like don't pass out with your shoes on And don't leave the house till the booze gone And don't have sex if shes too gone When it comes to condoms put two on Then tomorrow night find a new joint	Don't tell other freshmen you're over 21 unless you want a bunch of classmates asking you to buy them alcohol all the time
Women of AskMen, what is the most interesting fact you've learned from reading AskMen?	That men harbor some pretty deep resentment against women. Other users here talked about how insecure many men are, but that doesn't surprise me. People are generally insecure, especially young people. The difference is women will hate and blame themselves, or in a more critical evaluation "society", but men will blame women for feeling like shit about themselves.	I didn't realize how much a woman initiating sex with her SO meant to so many men. I've been making a conscious effort to make sure my guy feels wanted as much as he does that for me after reading posts here.
Whats the luckiest sex youve ever had?	From about two days before the blizzard that blew through a few weeks ago to three days after, my girlfriend and I didn't see each other. When I was able to get dug out and go to her apartment afterwards, the first thing she did was yank me inside and then she dropped the towel she was wearing. Great sex ensued	Had a girl slide up into my DM's on IG, talked for a bit, she bought a plane ticket and flew interstate to spend a few nights with me then went home. Such a weird experience
Men, if a girl were to take you on a picnic, what kind of foods would you be excited to see that she brought?	Picnics are lame, when planned. When done in a surprisng way, they are awesome. You gotta do it right. Example: I surprised my girlfriend (now wife) with a picnic. But, more like an ambush. It was a beautiful day. At the time, I had a gorgeous 300ZX (T-Tops FTW). So I packed a few basic sandwiches, drinks, vase and a few flowers in a bag. I then waited at the exit of her work. So when she and her coworkers walked out, boom, there I am, picking her up in a cool pseudo-convertible sports car, and whisked her away to a nearby National Park, and had the picnic. The food was irrelevant. It was the thought behind the gesture, the surprise, compounded by the jealously of her coworkers.	all you need is some wine and bread, with some meat and cheese to go with them. > Are picnics lame? how good is the view and how private is the place? I can't see an urban greenspace full of parents chasing their little kids being much fun.
How you feel when your SO "fishes for a compliment"?	My last relationship actually failed because i couldn't get on board with this annoying trait. In fact every time she'd fish for a compliment or any other answer via text I'd always send the fishing emoji back to her like a real jack ass. That and of course I'd "mansplain," as she liked to call it.	Would not affect me personally but i would feel sorry for her being troubled by such thoughts. I'd give her the compliment she's fishing for and in the hours following that i may throw in a few extra gropes/pinches *(if i know she likes that ofc)* and let myself get "caught" checking out her body. With my ex-GF it would usually result in her smiling, giggling and getting turned on. Resulting in sexy time. Win-win.
When do you stop doubting yourself when dating a girl?	Women play games, assume any disinterest is that. Don't care too much about the relationship, if you start to build up its importance you will act clingy. If it works out its fine, if it doesn't its also fine.	It has only been one date. Even if everything went to shit you're barely invested in this relationship, if you can call it that. Fortunately for you, she asked to go on a second date. Now if I were you I'd be excited about my second date with this lovely lady and not coming up with a million reasons for it to go wrong. Don't be your own worst enemy here.
What movie is amazing in the first half and a complete disappointment in the second?	Star Wars The Force Awakens seemed decent and cool for the first like 45 minutes, and then it went to shit really fast with cliches and boring story telling.	Mine is Cameron's Avatar. Spoilers, obviously. If you cut the movie right when the humans burn down the giant sacred tree, it's fucking amazing. It's a moving tale of a fascinating species fighting against invaders, a reminder of what mankind usually is, a good love story and a visual masterpiece. However, the movie doesn't stop there, and adds a godawful hour of cliche fights where the good guys win against all odds, outnumbered with worse means, by sheer plot armor. And obviously a happy ending that's literally been seen a million times before. It's such a shame. The powerful and moving message of the movie is toned down in order to make it more commercially appealing.
How many cats can a single woman own before it becomes a red flag for you? What about horses? Snakes? Frogs?	Don't know....Depends of the house. Say if she lives in a huge country house and has 100+ cats there, it definitely wouldn't be a red flag to me. I love cats :3 especially furry cats. Horses, no i hate horses, even one is a red flag, they smell bad, always with flys around their ass, plus they're ugly. Horse for me is a meal. Don't know why people have so much prejuducie about eating horse, they taste like cow meat. Frogs are nice, but they're better in a country house as well, in a cool garden.	It's not the number: it's when they start getting unironically anthropomorphised that's the issue. Also there's a difference between someone who owns, say, six horses because she's a horse-nut, and someone who owns six horses because she runs a stable and riding school as a successful business. Also: as someone who owns more guitars than limbs, I shouldn't throw stones.
Men of Reddit who didn't go/dropped out of college, what are you up to?	Pewdiepie dropped out of college when he was 18 or 19. Now he's the most subscribed Youtuber with 54.5 million subs, his net worth is $90 mil, and he's been in a relationship for 5 yrs. the b/tch isn't even 28 yet.	Currently am helping out with the family business. Structural welding. Worked on quite a few bridges in the SoCal area. As well as some buildings and a lot of other random stuff that needed welding. As well as misc. bank work, such as assembling/disassembling bank vaults, delivering/removing safes, safe deposit boxes, under counter units, ATMs, Night drops, TCDs and a whole bunch of other random banking equipment. Edit: added a word
Guys who have ever met a pornstar in real life, what was it like?	I went to college with a guy who went on to do porn. I asked him about it once. Said it was fun.	I met Stoya at one of her "movie" screenings (I believe she was the director or something, it was weird artistic type of stuff). She did a short Q&A afterwards then I sat with her for a bit at the afterparty to have a drink. I was actually quite surprised how well spoken she was and can say she definitely changed how I viewed pornstars for the most part. At the time, i dont believe her James Dean thing was public yet but I remember somebody asking how what it was like to date him and she said she didn't want to talk about it which seemed kinda odd. Overall it was an interesting experience. 9/10.
To the guys that WANT to be single right now, what are your reasons?	I've realized that right now, women seem to be too self centered, so getting to know someone isn't going to really happen. I'd love to make a deep connection, but because of Fbook and Instagram and Tinder, it's just not happening.	Kinda stuck in the middle here. Abstractly I want a relationship and companionship, but whenever I get close to the actual possibility I start to see all the reasons it would be inconvenient.
Do you feel like your SO is better than other people objectively, or do you think it's purely your personal preference?	Behind every wife is a trail of ex-boyfriends who are sick of her shit. Just because she's perfect for you, doesn't mean she's perfect for everyone.	She has certain traits that i place a lot of value into; so to me she's superior. But that doesn't mean everyone places the same value on the same traits. So I guess from my perspective it's both, but to everyone else it's a matter of preference
Men who had/have crushes on a close friend, what happened?	One of 3 things will *always* happen: * They'll agree and you go on a date / start to date * They'll say no and the friendship ends * They'll say no, you try to remain friends, but it eventually fails or is nowhere near the same level of friendship it once was	I asked her out and she told me she wasn't interested in me that way. We're still friends, but no where near as close as we used to be. Which sounds crappy, but it's actually good for me. I'm not breaking my back trying to please her anymore and I don't have to pine after her anymore.
How long is long enough for unwashed clothes to be worn again?	If it's clean, no stains and it doesn't smell terrible you can wear it the next day. Although I rarely wear jeans more than twice in a row.	Jeans aren't suppose to be washed very often. Typically when they start to get baggy or obviously when they smell or get dirty. However, I wash them more often in the summer than in the winter because of sweat, but a third time should be completely fine.
Have you ever burnt out on online dating? What was that like?	It will only work if: - You're "Tall" (6'-6'4) - You're good looking (at least a 7 on the 10 rating scale) - Older then 23 if you're doing the sites, apps don't matter as much - Good position in life (correlates with age) have own place, good car, wealthy enough, have a career. A woman told me most men she met off there were still in Min Wage jobs and she didn't want to date these people due to that.	People say rejection is better than not trying, but I've found rejection to be way worse. I'm apparently not attractive enough for online dating.
What complaint about women are you tired of hearing?	I hate hearing niceguys complain. "Waaaaah, women only like assholes!" "Waaaaah, hold a door open for them, and they think it's flirting! "waaaaah, women go for broke guys with no job, and beat them!" It's silly. They blame women for not liking them. But, it never occurs to them that maybe women aren't into IT gamer nerds. They aren't being nice because they're good people. They do nice because they hope it gets them laid. Like no guy with a decent job that pays his bill ever get gfs.	The anti-girl gamer/"you're not really a nerd". Also related, guys or people in general that discourage women from being smart. PLEASE SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU'RE RUINING IT FOR THE REST OF US. Girls that like science and math are rare as hell, it's already hard enough finding someone I can relate to without people discouraging them at every turn.
What was the most infuriating case of workplace politics you've ever had to put up with?	I sell cars, so I work at a dealership where men in their 50s can become teenage girls in about half a second on the showroom floor. It can be an everyday thing or once a week, but one of the sales guys is one of the "dinosaurs" left in the industry (high pressure, talks about himself all the time, etc) and has no problem blowing up on the showroom floor whether there are customers or not. I love what I do, but don't always love who I do it with.	Had a system outage that stopped 75% of the company from being able to do any work. Instead of fixing it right away and then figuring out what happened, my team lead (Applications) and another team lead (Systems) stopped both teams from doing anything with it. They then spent 3 days having meetings and sending emails behind each others back to various different department heads explaining why it wasn't their fault and that the other team was to blame. The head of the IT department was retiring, so they were both hoping to get promoted. I had to work that weekend with someone from the Systems team to fix the problem because "too much time has already been wasted on this". The only silver lining was neither of them got the promotion.
What is an immature or unrealistic relationship expectation that you've encountered or think is too common in today's society?	"Once a cheater, always a cheater" is a big pet peeve of mine. I'm not saying that you should date someone who has been a serial cheater in the past and expect things to be totally different with you, but I am say that there are massive gray areas and that a whole lot of people can actually grow and change. Just because Sally kissed Johnny playing spin the bottle at her 13th birthday party when she was dating Timmy doesn't mean she should be banned from dating for the rest of her life.	My comment is for relationships that are ending: *Just because the relationship ended doesn't mean it was a failure.* Maybe you two just grew incompatible. Maybe one of you moved away and one or neither wanted a long distance relationship. Whatever the case may be, I feel like whenever a couple breaks up, people assume that something is wrong with one of the people in the relationship, or that the relationship was bad. These things *do* happen, but I don't like to think that this applies to *all* ended relationships. IMO, as long as both people were able to grow and are better people for having dated each other, it's hardly a failure.
What is your favorite instance/story of "she's just being nice" that you (or with the "help" of a friend) later realized was undeniably strong signals of courtship and desire for higher levels of intimacy?	ITT: Every stereotype justified about how all women are fucking cowards who can't do anything but "drop hints" and how every man is wiling to fuck any willing woman ever.	We had just gotten high and were staring into each others eyes and I dunno what I thought at the time I was just laughing because I was high. I then moved away shortly thereafter and she texted me "how come we didn't fuck?" and it was around then that I realized...I was on the spectrum
What's your favorite thing to think about when you are looking at the stars?	That we are looking back in time. It's the closest we'll get to a time machine, looking at these massive nuclear explosions light years away. The cosmic landscape probably does not resemble what we see anymore. It's like looking at a plane of space frozen momentarily in time. Also the fact that we are composed of starstuff that eventually developed into a complex form of life that could one day look up, capture a little bit of that starlight in our eyes... and marvel. Skygazing is massively underrated.	I wonder if on another planet in another solar system, an alien is looking at the faint light of our very own star. I think about my past and how tiny we are compared to the universe. I also think about how peaceful it is.
What is the nicest thing a girl has ever said to you?	wow.. uh. judging by the comments in this thread I'm apparently really, really, really well off when it comes to compliments from women/girls. I've been told stuff like "you're so calming to be around" or "seeing you has just brightened my day" or "I love talking to you because you're so honest and understanding". honestly.. now I'm almost worried that I may perhaps have been looking like a big, helpless, puppy or sth to most of these women.	Got told by a friend that I'm one of the nicest and most genuine people she knows. This was months ago and it still makes me warm and fuzzy when I think about it
Anyone go from fit to fat? Did you get depressed, and how are you doing now?	Was never really fit the way you describe, but I was a regular runner and supplemented with weights at times. I got more responsibility at work, and my wife and I were expecting a child, so I got lazy and sedentary. Next thing I knew I had this bulging gut and was 20 pounds heavier than I had ever been. Shirts that had easily fit me now were disturbingly tight. It was a little depressing, but I got into eating right with Myfitnesspal and joined a gym. Lost 30 pounds. Felt good again.	I was a bike messenger for a while, which allowed me to eat & drink pretty much anything I wanted. Then 3 years ago I sold all my stuff and moved to Japan to teach English. It's a sedentary job with long hours, which has made it tough to get out on the bike, and my tiny rural town has no gym. Stress-related emotional eating & drinking, plus a high-carb Japanese diet caused me to put on a LOT of weight in my first year. I've since started to lose some of that weight, but it's a slow process, and I'm still bummed about it when I look in the mirror. To all you guys who are trying to make things right and get fit again, keep on keepin' on!
Guys who have dated a woman (or guy) that all your friends and family hated, how did that turn out? Are you still together? Did you lose friends?	I never gave a fuck, because it's not their life and they never see or understand the full picture. I never lost anyone from this, or at least anyone I actually cared about.	Broke up with her. When everyone tells you she isn't good for you and tells you she's a bitch, maybe your blinders are on. Years later I see her as just a person on occasion and she is kind of a bitch to everyone.
What creates an incel or a nice guy?	I think you've ventured too far away from /r/IamVerySmart Fucking Good Friday getting kids off of school so they have time to shitpost	Poor socialization would be the lion's share, I'd say, at least for incels. People who grow up ostracized by their peers never have the opportunity to properly develop their social skills, and taking the effort to rectify this can be logistically difficult in addition to the difficulties of trying to learn how to be properly social and play catch-up. Some people do seem to just be born pricks or become them from an early age without anyone having alienated them. As for Nice Guys, at least some of that is because of our own media when it comes to romance.
What unrealistic expectations do young men have about dating?	That you have to ask her out, then go on the date, then bang. My most successful relationships were bang first, date second. We just met in class, work, friends of friends, and hit it off well enough to bang before formally dating.	That there's some special trick that will make any woman want to sleep with you. Whether it's doing her a ton of favors, negging/peacocking/whatever the PUAs are talking about these days, having a six pack, whatever.
Have you ever met someone while single, had amazing chemistry only to never see them again? What happened?	Oh man. So, back in February, I went on a date with this woman, and we hit it off immediately. Sparks were flying, the chemistry was palpable, it was AWESOME. Then her grandma died a week later, and I haven't heard from her since. No response to my texts, no answer to my one (1) phone call. No idea what happened. Maybe I fucked something up, maybe she just wasn't ready for things to get real. Who knows?	Yeah. The girl who I kept making eye contact with while shopping today. She was stupid cute and I was too big of a bitch to go say hi. To really answer your question: no.
Do you treat prettier women better? If so, how?	Honestly it's probably the opposite, because I see they're really pretty and then I start to assume I have no chance, and/or that I would receive no understanding from them about my needs or desires or how I'm hurting and what effect their beauty has on me. In fact I start to assume they'd probably want to call me a pig or creep for what I can't help feeling. So, I start to feel resentful. I don't say mean things or anything, I just will probably be a little colder than I would with someone I wasn't attracted to. OTOH, a pretty girl who through some means gets across that they *do* understand and accept how I feel, as rare as that seems to be these days, they get my full decency and then some in return.	I'm sure that I do, but I'm also sure that it's largely unconscious and a sort of generalized across the board effect.
How do you function normally in daily life while battling with depression?	Take the easy way out and get on some SSRIs. It'll change your personality and decrease your sex drive, but thems the breaks	I just do what I need to do like I did before depression. I get up, take care of myself, exercise, eat, clean etc. because I know it's better for me than doing nothing. I don't want the depression to win so I don't let it. I feel nothing inside but I try not to let it show by being polite and attempting to be friendly. I almost feel like I am faking everything but it's better than lying in bed all day.
Do you shower in the morning or at night?	Morning, I want to be fresh for my friends and classmates. Whoever showers at night and goes to work or school in the morning without showering is a fucking monster and should be sent to Australia	Both. I shower when i wake up, and i shower when i get home after the gym while my dinner is in the oven.
What's your experience with telling your girlfriend she needs to put more effort into the relationship?	I'm a guy, but if I heard it phrased that way I'd reconsider the relationship. If you're needy, fucking say it. We all have different needs when it comes to how much we want to interact with our partners. But if you need more attention, don't make it the other person's fault/problem. If you are needy, trying to make it come-off in a different way only kicks that can down the road, to be dealt with later when the relationship has got more serious.	In the past my SO has said things like "I don't feel like I'm a priority to you" and my response is "oh shit I've gotten lazy" and then I make more effort. I've had to have the same conversation with him. Not sure how long your relationship is, but it's fairly common to start to take your partner for granted without realizing it. Sometimes you need a nudge to get back on track. If she's emotionally mature, she should take it in stride. If she's not.....good luck.
Dads of Reddit, what's it like to have a daughter?	I was not prepared for how much I was looked at/treated like a pedofile for being in public with just my daughter and myself.	9 months in. It's awesome. She's a cool person, despite not being able to do too much. Her personality is just starting to develop. I think she got my mischief streak. She looks like her mom. Smiles like me. It's cool to see parts of you and your personality in another person - especially one you made with someone you love.
guys who are afraid to get into a relationships ? what makes you afraid ?	Some **psycho bitch** who appears normal, however threatens to bruise herself and call the police reporting I did it to her (we all know who the police and court would believe). Or even better, she's mad at you and falsely accuses you of rape. Even if you are found innocent in court, the mere allegation would have destroyed your professional reputation (especially if you are a medical doctor, lawyer, or professor) and subject you to public scrutiny from your friends, family and local news. Relationships are unsafe legally for men.	I wouldn't say I'm afraid. Fatigued, perhaps. Relationships these days are just too difficult. You can't count on anything to be predictable or sure. The standards are constantly being redefined and the relationships lines of do/don't are always moving, when everything is under scrutiny for offense or relationship power dynamics. I'm just tired of trying to prove myself as a decent and stable person who wants to be a good companion with equal give and take when that's just not good enough anymore.
AskMen, what would you say the most common mistake is that women make in a relationship?	It's not one thing... it's like a web of shitty mistakes women make that all involves... well, self-centerdness. Things that I've experienced and seen with pretty much most women these days (note I said most, not all): * Bringing nothing to the table except their presence and vagina. * Overestimating their own market value. * Underestimating their man's market value. * Entitlement, entitlement, entitlement. * Selfishness. * Thinking they're the star of the show. * The relationship is all about them, and what they want, and their "journey", making them happy. * Making it all about their feeeeeeewings. * Piss poor communication. I've noticed this more from women than men despite the stereotype. Expecting the man to be psychic. * Trying to be in charge of the relationship. No.	Not being honest about their problems. If you have a problem with our relationship, pretending there isn't one isn't going to fix it. *Be honest with me about your concerns and we can fix it together.*
My parents have decided next Monday they are going to put our dog down. Never had to go through this before, how did you deal with it?	Sucks ass man, it sounds bad, but if you ever want another dog, this is the best time to get one. Otherwise you'll keep leaving it, and postponing it, so enjoy being with your dog while you can, and try and find a new one within a week, moving on quickly is the best choice.	You're lucky, I was away when my dog got put down. It sucked, I never got to say goodbye or be with him the day of. Cuddle with him, give him lots of treats and scratches, make him comfortable, and remember that he will always love you.
What's something that you put many hours into, that you now regret?	Certain video games when I was a teenager. Some of them made me really mad and then I'd feel real bad about myself (because something made for entertainment shouldn't upset me so much). I should have just stopped playing them but I kept going back to anger. They were my escape and I guess the frustration from them was more grounded than the frustration from just being 16.	Reddit. It sucks up a lot of my time during downtimes at work. It's sometimes entertaining at the moment, but 99% of what I read is never thought of again and is forgotten by the next day or two. It's weird
Millennials, how do you feel about being in the least religious generation ever?	Personal opinion: Religion is a cancer that serves no practical purpose today. I'm glad so many young men and women are ignoring and outright fighting the religious doctrine that has held society and technology and science back for such a long period of time. I read a study, somewhere, that when you tested the morals of Atheists and religious people, the atheists were far more in lined with the morals of *Jesus* than the Christians were. Implying Jesus ever existed in the first place. Religion is fighting for it's life, but it's failing. I love that.	I would like to see something replace it in terms of community. Not sure what exactly. I think church serves this purpose for a lot of people who don't have time or money to get involved in other group activities. Plenty of non-believers go for this reason. There's so much social insulation in todays society already. Everywhere you go bored and anxious people looking at their phones instead of interacting. It's​ depressing but I can't help but do it too.
In your opinion, when does a boy become a man?	When he stops asking childish questions like, "when does a boy become a man?". If you have to ask, you're not one.	When he is swift as a coursing river, with all the force of a great typhoon, with all the strength of a raging fire, mysterious as the dark side of the moon.
Men of Reddit land, how do you feel about dating single mums?	I don't want to say there's a 0% chance, so I'll say 1%. I don't want to have to provide for another man's children while he runs around knocking up other girls. Also, single moms seem to search for guys who can provide for her and her kid, as opposed to actually liking the guy for who he is. I would rather not be a walking wallet. Your situation is a classic though. You spend your 20s having fun and hooking up with hot guys on the daily, but as you grow older and your looks fade, you start to realize that you need a provider to fix up your life.	I'm 32, so I'm around your age. I have a huge hesitation when it comes to getting involved with women who have kids. It's not a knock on you. It's due to my own experiences when I was a kid and my parents pursued romantic interests after their divorce. If things were to get serious, then I would have to accept the responsibility of being a father figure to those kids. I know I don't have to literally be their father, but there's still a responsibility there. Not accepting that responsibility wouldn't be fair to you, or the kids. It's not something I take lightly because I know what happens when it goes bad. I lived it. Maybe I'm just being over paranoid, but I don't feel like I'm ready to be that father figure and I'm terrified of becoming the kind person I hated when I was a kid.
Female friends of yours have talked about/know your penis size. How do you feel about it?	My ex actually bragged about my size and performance while drunk when I was present in a bar. It was kinda funny but nothing more. I don't care who knows, it's just a penis.	I have a small penis. My ex told her friends, her friends would make snide comments about it in a "joking way", they brought it up constantly, somehow managed to relate everything I say back to my penis, cut off all contact with them, now have no friends.
Whats the hottest thing a girl does that's NON-Sexual?	Someone who actually tells you when something is bothering her instead of being an insecure passive aggressive womanchild and expecting you to magically figure out what's wrong	I think it's super hot when a girl is genuinely interested in whatever we're talking about and makes a lot of eye contact. I'm a pretty introverted person and I'm pretty self conscious so someone being super into me when there's other more interesting people to talk to gets me going nicely.
Hello men. Can you please explain to me what the gym etiquette is when it comes to talking to others, and what your own motivations are when it comes to talking to a girl at the gym?	a woman said "hey, i've been seeing you at the gym, looking good!" i got SO MAD about it, how dare someone compliment me!?!	I think the only things I say to people at the gym fall into the following categories * Are they using that machine/equipment much longer * Can I jump in between their sets * Do you know if anyone is using this or did the last person just not rack their damn weights * Nice job on the set/weight/progress * Can you spot me * Can you pull this off me if I royally fuck up * Does this leg raise machine look like I'm riding a jetpack when I first lift myself?
Men, do you get asked about wanting children and how do you deal with people's reaction when you say no?	All the time. I tell them I would instill the same dictatorship I have with my dogs and choke them when they get out of line. There is usually very few follow up questions.	Dating is a little tricky since it seems like most of the girls I meet around my age are looking to settle down and have kids at some point. People often say that I may change my mind, and I agree. I might very well change my mind in a few years. But today, right now, in this moment, I absolutely am not interested in kids nor am I planning for it.
What's it like having sex with a pregnant woman?	Big tits, sweet breastmilk, and she was horny AF. My dick might be long, but it's not nearly long enough to hurt an unborn baby. Pregnant bellies are not like fat bellies. They're not particularly attractive or unattractive in my mind. Overall I would recommend it.	There's no risk of harming the baby, and sex can actually help stimulate the onset of labour, once she's near-term (relief!) As a male, I noticed my wife was much more into sex while she was pregnant. We did need to moderate the kinds of positions we used, so that they were comfortable for her, and that was a novelty since she was not that adventurous before. I wish we were rich enough to have more kids! LOL But, seriously, sex with my pregnant wife was some of the best I've ever had with her! Great memories.
What's the appropriate amount of time to wait before eating someone on a desert island?	I think 3-5 hours is appropriate. You don't want to be too hungry to overpower someone, but you don't want to be THAT guy and start eating before everyone else. Of course, you'd want to ask anyone else if they're hungry before you start knocking people over the head with coconuts, just to be polite.	The last few hours before you die of starvation, because at that point your only other outcome is probably death. I would implore you to try and not eat anyone on the island and instead make smoke signals or giant help signs on the island with your fellow strandees to catch the attention of the inevitable rescue crew. And then when everyone else agrees and nods to my suggestion I go in for the kill.
How do you deal with your girlfriend being hit on constantly?	Dude, I have a similar thing (in bars and nightclubs, not on the street or anything). Gets hit on pretty much every night out we have like that. The first few times I was uncomfortable like you, and I guess in the early stage you just have to trust her, but it can't hurt to make sure you're around with her too. Nowadays me and my SO exploit the guys who hit on her. She'll take them up on their offer for a free drink, get the drink, leave them and come to me. Then we share the drinks together. Free drinks! And if a guys keeps being persistent she'll often come and kiss me. Once you get to this stage in the relationship, a "disadvantage" can be turned into an advantage :)	Just because the attention from males is new for you to see doesn't mean that it is new for her to experience, and that might be something to remember. You see it as a big deal but she just sees it as boring everyday life, probably a mild annoyance. You already knew that she could cheat if she wanted to, and that's true whether she gets hit on constantly or not. She knows how to turn guys away and if someone wanted to stand out to her that would be a rare person indeed. If you aren't worried about her integrity then this is no threat to you at all.
What are the Pros and cons of having and not having an SO?	I've been thinking about this a lot recently (mum asked why I'm STILL single, and I asked her why should I not), and I'm struggling to think of a reason other than sex for the pros. Emotional support is something that you can get from friends and family, and I'm a bit of a solitary person, so loneliness isn't something I feel, but again, you have friends and family. Like, it almost feels like it's more for the woman's benefit, but, again, I don't see how. I think it's more whether you want people to think you're happy, and you have your shit together. I'm probably wrong, just my opinion.	Pro: i can do most things without needing to schedule or anything. I also havent shaved my balls in a long time. And my bedroom is a mess and i dont have to worry about anybody judging me for it. Con: im lonely and sad and in desperate need of hugs and kisses and cuddling.
Men who don't use Facebook, do you feel like you are missing out? If so what are some examples? If not, why?	No. Why what? The question doesn't even make sense -- you wouldn't ask somebody why they felt like they weren't missing out just because they didn't shit in a porta-potty.	Nope, I much prefer face to face conversation and talking on the phone. I have a small number of close friends, which is good enough for me.
How can I stop feeling like a loser because I'm a virgin even though I'm happy in all other areas of my life?	most comments here are actually bullshit. You do not feel like a loser for not having sex because society tells you. SEX IS A NORMAL NEED AND NOT HAVING IT IS BAD FOR YOU. It is good to try to have sex.Unfortunately if you did not have sex until now it usually is because you are not good looking. In recent years women only go for very good looking men especially when they are young and they do not give a change to men who are average. there has been a big change in the behavior of women in the last 30-40 years and it is in the detriment of the average and bottom looking men.	I'm going to disagree with everyone here who says "don't worry about it" or "it's not a big deal". If you want to have sex but aren't having it, you have to actively work toward making it happen (without letting your grades drop, of course - grades and sex are mutually compatible, and I shouldn't have to say it, but there are people who will argue against this). When you made out with those girls, did you want to and try to have sex with them?
Farted while talking on the phone right before our first date. She started laughing. What do I do now?	Grow up. Once you get past 16 years-old check to see if you're mature enough to be in any kind of relationship.	Well, she did not hang up on you and reject further conversation, so that is good. Never mention it again and move on. Repeat: do not mention your gaseous habits.
What is it like to have a woman hit on you? How often does it happen?	I generally let girls express interest in me or hit on me rather than being the first to do it. It's fairly often, pretty nice and once they've done it I know I'm in.	If she asked to touch, that was her hitting on you. I've never been hit on so I can't add anymore haha^fml
Straight guys, what's the most homosexual exp. you had and did you regret it?	Gay guy bought me a drink at a bar and tried to get into my pants. I declined politely, explaining I was into girls.	One of the supervisors at my company tried to have sex with me. We got as far as my bedroom before I realized what was going on. He, some co-workers, and I had had all been at a bar. I was pretty drunk and I thought he wanted a place to sober up before driving. Call it naivety, but I had no idea he was trying to make a play on me as we were discussing my potential romantic interest at the time (who is indeed a woman). I had to explain my heterosexual alignment and felt terrible that it had even gotten to that point.
What do you like to buy when you "treat yourself"?	Take away Whiskey Car mods Xbox games Tattoos. Got my yearly bonus from work last week and got a chance to treat myself. Spent it on a full day tattoo session.	Expensive takeout food, like fancy sushi or something like that. Usually on a Friday night when I'm feeling good but don't have any plans. I'll pick it up, fire up a good show on netflix and just sit there with my dog and be happy.
What "worst case scenario" actually happened when you went up and talked to someone?	Not my worst case scenario, but *her* worst case scenario. She tried to get my attention from behind unexpectedly, I turned suddenly and essentially punched her in the tits. This time it was accidental. She's a total bitch so I didn't really feel bad about it. I 'accidentally' punched her in the tits on at least two other occasions.	Several years ago I was at a bar with a small dance floor. I was really trashed, and finally some rock comes on. I go up on the dance floor and start air guitaring my heart out. Then this cute punk chick comes and starts dancing with me and offering me some of her beer. I take a swig, and hand it back. I was feeling great. And then her less attractive frumpy friend comes up, pulls her aside and loudly says "Ewwwww what are you doing, dancing with the fat ape?!" and proceeded to pull her friend away. That deflated my ego somewhat, although I still danced with her friend. Another time when I was like a freshman in college, I asked a girl to dance at home coming or some such dance and she shook her head and said "ughhh nope! Next!"
What do you want sexually but never ask your Girlfriend/Wife to do?	Nothing. I've talked with my wife about all the stuff I want to do. She's not willing to try all of it, but we've talked openly about it.	For her to come to me without asking in her lingerie or naked and tell me she wants me to fuck her right there and then. Won't ask because then I won't feel it's her choice to do it.
How would you feel about being a house husband?	Not a relationship that would last long. Women are often the prime enforcers of social norms and most of the stories I've heard end with the woman seeing the man more and more as a lazy parasite	I want to be one. My wife and I are expecting our first in June. She makes more money than I do and I have wanted to be a house husband. I never had a dad and since we started trying I've been wanting to be a more involved parent than a night time and weekend parent(breadwinner). I want to be full time.
What is something women complain about men doing that we do as a consequence of what women do?	> do the proper messages the girl doesn't respond What does that even mean? That because you didn't "Hi babe" or something copied that you "deserve" interaction? If you can't handle rejection, don't online date lol	For me it's raising voices. Something will happen, and we'll start heatedly talking, she'll raise her voice to talk over me, which causes me to raise my voice to speak over her.One of us will point out the other is shouting and it'll devolve into bickering over who was shouting over who first.
What dating advice did your father/mother give you that was very usefull or very useless?	ITT: My parents never gave me advice. So I don't have anything to add to this conversation except writing a completely useless fucking comment, sorry bye I mean really people....?	My best friends mom was a model most of her life and this is what she told me in highschool. "That absolutely gorgeous girl that you have no shot with because she is way out of you league? Go for her. Because everyone else things that same thing or is too intimidated by her looks to approach her so she is probably single. If she shoots you down because of her looks then you're lucky​ you found out her personality sooner." She also brought me to photo shoots to force me to spend a lot of time around attractive woman. Learned how to be comfortable and myself around them.
How do you flirt with locals when you're a foreigner?	The same way you do with your local women. Btw I would pretend not to know french. I've heard most people in major European cities know English better than you'll know their language. And I think the French hate the French Canadian.	You also have plenty of advantages as a foreigner. Basicly, you are playing in god mode. First, you have a conversation starter: you are new here and try to meet people. Second, you have a different culture and learning the local culture or explaining your own make for good conversation. Third, people don't expect you to be as sharp as a local when it comes to language and alike. You are a foreigner, they are forgiving and don't expect subtle playwords. Finally, foreign is intriguing and generally sexy. Source: I'm french, lived in the netherland, denmark, japan and the usa.
What's something that you listen to your SO talk about but don't really care at all?	Almost everything. She's always spouting on about some trivial stuff about people at work or stuff in her game or a click bait article that she 'relates' to or how she looks after putting on make up or how she thinks she's fat when she could really use a few more pounds or does this shirt looks good with there jeans etc etc etc That thing about women having hundreds of internet explorer tabs open in their brain is no joke.	All the bitches she works with. "Every woman got a woman at work she hates. And it's always some Dynasty shit."------Chris Rock
What non-sexual thing do you wish you had experienced sooner because you enjoyed it so much when it finally happened?	Trying cocaine. Did it first at 19, was pissed I wasted so many years not knowing how amazing the sensation was.	Working out. I never actually hit the gym until I was in my early 20's. The feeling you get from working out, the confidence, the feel-good endorphins, just everything has been so amazing. I wish I started earlier.
Men who hit the gym before work, how do you get through the day without falling asleep?	Boy I'm lucky. I've a small gym at work so I do 45 minutes around 2 or 2:30 or whenever my afternoon slump starts setting in. Then, I have have some sugar and a coffee after that and stay productive until 6pm.	I half think its not the gym that did it, its the early rising. Getting up early without being in that routine isn't easy. You usually start work at 830, so maybe you wake up at 7 regularly? 3.5hrs out of sleep schedule is a big change suddenly. Maybe you're just not used to it yet or need to go to bed earlier. Just a thought.
Guys, what do you think of girls who gently tell you upfront that they like you, would that be considered too forward or do men actually prefer this method?	>Should I tell him that I like him or let it progress naturally? Meaning "sit passively like a good woman and do nothing unless he takes it on himself." Feel free to be a little more proactive than that.	It's fine, absolutely no reason you can't be honest with him about your feelings. No one's going to be offended by something like that.
Content and happy guys of askmen, how do you do it?	Engage in activities & exercise, give less fucks, and stop wishing for some girl to come along to make you happy cuz she probably ain't coming until you already are happy.	Largely stopped caring about a lot of things that don't directly effect me. Not to say I don't care about anyone or anything, because I do - without caring I wouldn't be able to find happiness in stuff that I do and others accomplish Just have to find peace with who you are, where you are, and take each day as they come.
What moment do you look back on and can't believe how much of an idiot you were?	Believing that Hillary Clinton actually had a rat ass chance in hell of winning the US 2016 Presidential election. She is a born loser and will remain that way forever and ever.	When I was 14 my brother and I fell for the hype of rock band. Summer of 08 we went to get the game but it was like $180 and our mom didn't wanna spend that much. So what did we do? We traded in almost our entire GameCube collection, including what are now some hard to find or expensive games. That plastic drum set broke within a month and we got tired of the game shortly after since the drums were the most fun part... Fuck rock band and their shit tier hardware. I would do anything to have my old game collection back.
Guys, I'm moving into my first apartment right now. What are the secret essentials?	Plunger (obvious) Slow cooker (google any recipe and be a master) Couch (won't get pussy without it) Guest bong (cuz you're a good guy)	If you want to play it safe, take pictures of everything before you move in furniture. On moving out, if the landlord tries to charge you for damage you didn't cause you can use this to defend yourself financially.
What are some common fuck-ups I can avoid for my first job?	Punch someone the very first hour you're there to assert dominance. Pee in a corner of the office. Bark every time someone goes near it or talks about it. Hire a lawyer and hit the gym, it'll make you feel good. Don't go on social media for a while. You should see a doctor about it. Dress for the job you want, not the one you have. Amazon has great prices in Batman masks this week.	Stay out of any office drama/gossip. And keep your personal life mostly personal until you really know people. Good luck!
Bros, what do you think about getting STD tests at the start of every relationship?	Save that conversation for after you've been fucking her with **condoms** for a little while. That way, if she gets pissed off and leaves you, at least you got to bone her a bunch of times, amirite? I mean, having her piss off before you get to nail her *at all* is pretty disappointing.	You're being absolutely reasonable, and I commend you for doing so. There's a reason STD rates have skyrocketed in recent years, and the refusal to take accountability for one's sexual health is why. Any time STD testing threads come up there I'm astounded at how many people never have, or rarely have them. I'm a woman, but if I suggested mutual STD testing and the guy got angry then I'd probably cut and run. It doesn't necessarily mean this person is trying to hide an STD from you, but it means her attitudes towards sexual health are pretty backwards and her logic isn't all there. Those two issues should be seriously considered as deal breakers.
(Young) Japanese Men of Reddit, Why do So Few of You Date? What Factors Are Keeping You Out Of Long Term Relationships?	Not Japanese and not male but thought it'd be cool to add. The Japanese language apparently doesn't have a phrase for "I love you". The phrase they use is more like a "I really, really like you."	I'm japanese, born in Japan, raised and currently living in Canada. I never really got this meme of so few of Japanese youth dating. Its moreso they aren't getting married and starting families. All of my japanese friends (~18 yrs old) have been in at least one to two relationships, and I'm currently in a relationship. Seems like japanese people are especially reserved around new people or outsiders to their group and take time to warm up to them. Especially japanese girls. They're like the polar opposite of western girls who are instant best friends literally minutes after they just meet. It could also being the culture that promotes obsession about whatever interests you, be it work, school, hobbies or whatever that end up leaving no time for anything else like a relationship.
Men who live alone, how do you discipline yourself to do household chores?	What's the problem? You live by yourself, you can do whatever you want. Cleaning up every now and again when you feel like it is perfectly fine.	I want to live in a decent home and that means that I have to keep it clean. That's all the motivation I need.
When do you cut people out of your life?	When they bwcome douchebags with MY work or private life. I am very fine with them being terrible people, I know how ti handle it on a daily basis with diplomacy. But don t even TRY it with me.	When I don't like them anymore. When I feel the friendship is only one sided. When hanging out with these people feels more like an obligation. When I feel remaining friends makes me "sick" and unhappy.
Men, what are some common dating mistakes you've seen girls make?	The only similarities women have with each other is the fact they are women. There's far too much variation to pick out any generalisations. At least in my experience.	Playing 2 guys against each other thinking it will result in some romantic over the top gesture by one of them, when in reality it creates drama and a social cluster fuck.
When did you really start taking care of your body?	I haven't really. I'm still young, 26, so I'm trying to start some easy-to-maintain habits and slowly build. For now, I cook a week of (vegan) meals every Saturday night and do a yoga routine from YouTube every night.	In my early 20s. I was kind of fat, but my dad's family is full of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. I didn't want to end up like them. Now 20 years later, I'm in decent shape. Never wanted to look like John Cena. I do it for my health, not to be swole for chicks.
Men, what's the most offensive thing someone can say to you, and why is it so bad?	I can't think of anything that could be said that would offend me. Actually, I'm having a hard time even imagining what being offended even feels like.	I have a stutter. Well, more like a stammer at the very beginning of words. When people say "slow down and think about what you want to say", it infuriates me. I already know the exact sentence I'm going to say. That is the worst thing you can say to someone with that type os speech impediment.
What's the dumbest thing someone has called the cops on you for?	We had the cops called on us because it was Christmas day and my entire family was drunkenly playing baseball in the hallway of the hotel we were at and my uncle was being really belligerent to the hotel manager when he asked us to stop.	A guy who backed into a dumpster at an apartment complex called the cops and claimed I backed into his car and then ran off. As soon as I showed up, the cop dismissed it as I had no damage to the bumper of my vehicle, nor any paint scraped on it. Also, the paint scraped on his car was blue (matching the dumpster) and my vehicle was brown. It was also a pickup truck, where as his car was an older toyota, and due to the height of my vehicle, it was impossible that I would have hit him where he claimed I did, as the point of impact would be much higher.
When does a breakup hit you the hardest?	I'm a girl but I feel like I respond slow, I'm just numb. Yesterday, actually, my boyfriend and I were arguing - it was me, calling it quits... He was so so upset that I felt like the bad guy and later we made up. I feel really guilty but I wasn't in the wrong but I admit I regret calling a break up without the balls to go through with it.	It hits me the hardest when I finally take a look at my other dating options/revive the online dating profiles and remember how bleak it is out there.
What are some signs of disrespect that you might have experienced in relationships?	Not answering calls or texts because of stress/busy/whatever. If I'm calling or texting my SO it's because I care and to ignore that is pretty disrespectful.	Always answering you in a passive way. It usually means you're SO is starting to get tired of you and doesn't even have the gall to tell you off. Usually leads to a huge bottling of emotions instead of talking problems through to fix them. "So how was your day?" "Fine" "You wanna go somewhere today?" "If you wanna go then go ahead" "Where do you want food from?" "You pick whatever place you want." "Hey is everything alright?" "I don't know is everything alright?"
Men of reddit, how would you differentiate a "bitchy" woman vs. an "assertive" woman?	I try to avoid thinking of someone as "bitchy" precisely because of the double standard that exists for assertive people of different genders.	Assertive is using the authority and respect of your position. Bitchy or bossy is making demands you don't have the authority to make. Being a leader is a skill, being a dictator is a great way to lose respect. This is independent of sex, I have women as bosses/co-workers that are great leaders, and I have men as bosses/co-workers that are bitchy. I hate the hypersensitivity around calling a spade a spade. If your leadership skills suck, you'll lose my respect. Your genitals have nothing to do with it.
Women of AskMen, what brings you to AskMen?	It's way better than that feminist crap all over askwomen. I feel like I have more of a male-ish mind anyway. I also enjoy dirty humor and not discussing makeup or tampons lol.	I like answering questions. The community here is fun. I like learning about male opinions. The modding/community on askwomen is stifling. I received a lot of vitriol and harassment from angry *male* users when I posted on askwomen because they were lurking there to find someone to be a dick to. I can't say "be a dick" on askwomen. Askreddit is full of more teenagers than this sub already is.
I still feel like a boy even though I am a father of 3yo daughter and provide to my family. How do I start feeling like a grown-up man?	Wow. I'm 21 and I still feel like I'm not ready for the world. I have yet to figure it out.	You don't, ever. I have a son and two daughters and I am making everything up as I go. *Everything*. I do not feel grown-up so much as I feel like an 18-year-old with entirely too much responsibility and no way to outsource any of it. You have to get comfortable with improvising, you have to get comfortable with making mistakes (and either owning them or shrugging them off), and you have to get comfortable with projecting the air that you know what you're doing. You will never reach a point where you're like "yeah, I can handle this, that must mean I've finally arrived." There's no scheduled arrival. It's a perpetual journey.
How much attention should you expect from your girlfriend in a group setting?	I hate this too OP. There's a quote from downtown abbey I'll botch but it goes like "I know I'm not the most impressive man but I want to marry a women who thinks I am." Be with someone who is crazy about you. Not someone who is willing to be with you but lukewarm when it gets down to it.	Talk to her. I personally am ok with her giving me the least attention because I get a ton of attention from her anyways and it's nice to know she has friends besides me.
What is some female club/bar behavior that you don't appreciate?	Dancing/dressing like a thot and then turning down every guy that approaches her in the most dramatic fashion possible. I'm not here to boost your self-esteem.	Trying to get me to buy them drinks. It's 2017 and if you want to flirt you'll have to do better than, "spend money on me".
Where do I meet friends who consider me their 'first option' ?	Thats not how friendships work... you don't meet people than manipulate your way until people consider you #1. You find people that you GENUINELY get along with on a deeper level. A relationship goes two ways, if the feelings are not reciprocated than its not the relationship you think it is.	Cultivate individual friendships with multiple people in the same social circle. The more people in a group who have a personal relationship with you, the more logical it will be to include you in group activities. Build your own social circle. If you have friends who you think will get along, introduce them to each other. If you become a key social connection for people you will naturally be included. Have multiple social circles. If you are on the periphery of multiple groups, you are not reliant on any of them, so being excluded from certain activities is less important. Most importantly, stop caring so much. Most groups are wheels within wheels, right down to pairs of best friends, and everybody is sometimes excluded from something.
What's the nicest thing a woman you weren't dating/related to has ever told you?	It's sexual but... She was on top and I said "you know I can keep going for a lot longer right?" and she replied "I know that's why I love fucking you". I was just like yeeeeeaaaaaaaaa booooiiiiiiiii Or there was the time a girl I dated said you are a really genuine person so that's why we have to break up, because you deserve better than me. I'm like "yay?... Awwww shit."	I've had women compliment me on how genuine I am. I think I'm really just too introverted to be capable of being anything other than who I am, still a nice compliment though.
When was the first time you had unprotected sex?	Good for most of y'all. I literally have never had sex with a condom. I lost my virginity at 13 and now I'm 21 with 20+ bodies. I know I'm stupid. Don't follow my step. It's a habit I'm actually trying to break now	Without a condom- my college girlfriend, around 21. She was on the pill. It was awesome. Life changing. Even though I had to really train myself not to finish in thirty seconds. Without any protection- hasn't happened yet, even though I have kids. But I'm getting a vasectomy this year, so my wife can have her IUD out next year. Looking forward to shooting blanks, especially because we had two sneak past the goalie already.
Men, what do you want to get off of your chest?	The sarcastic, ironic humor of my generation has been weaponized and I am sorry to you younger people. It has bred legitimate assholes. We were just playing at it because we knew it was awful. Somewhere it got poisoned. We all lost something when this happened. I am sorry for my part in not seeing the signs and continuing to dispense ironically prejudiced humor in a now post-irony climate.	Argh. Fuck this heat! I'm sweating my bollocks off and tomorrow I'm going in to a hot office with no aircon to sweat balls all day. Yay me.
Guys who got into fitness/dieting, did you get pushback from friends or family? What was the most ridiculous comment you've heard?	Do you live in an area that's mostly unhealthy/overweight/obese people? I've only ever gotten support and compliments after working out.	Always get the "you're getting too muscular" and "dieting and working out doesn't necessarily make you healthy" stuff off them, they're always telling me "you don't have to diet today it's the weekend" so I can eat a lot of bs... this is just coming from my parents and other family members. Then they complain about how they're fat just because they eat and how they feel self-conscious eating around me but yet how confident and happy they feel because they can eat whatever and not care about how they look. They constantly try to rub in my face the "freedom" they have from being careless.
Men who need a lot of physical affection, how do you cope when you're single ?	I'm that way too. I cope by finding things to take up my time and distract me like hobbies and work. And going out with my friends who tend to be affectionate. Also, you know that you can have sex while being single, right?	Naturally a needy male, 25 y/o, haven't had a legit gf my entire life. No sex. In 5 years, I'll become a wizard, which is nice
Guys, what have you noticed that girls do on first dates that bothers you?	I've been off the dating market since before Tinder was ever a thing. I had to meet my dating prospects in the real world. Do y'all fuckers really deal with such horseshit as what you've listed here, nowadays? Because, fuck all that with a spiky dildo. Back in my day (2012), any girl I went on a date with was equally excited to go on a date with me. That meant they'd show enough respect to be on time, be present, etc. It wasn't until after the first date that they'd decide to treat me like shit because of reasons or vice versa. Maybe my preconceptions are out of date, but I think maybe the reason your dates treat you like shit is partially because you let them. The other part is because no one ever taught them better.	Being quiet forcing all the conversation onto the man, and then not being particularly responsive if they are guiding the conversation in the right direction. It's like a job interview sometimes and totally one sided.
How *exactly* am I supposed to ask a guy out?	If you know so little about him (if he has a gf, not knowing when you'll see him next) then you don't know him well enough for him to want to spend time with you. Try forging a connection. Maybe he'll then ask *you* out. Asking someone out is an organic process that begins when you already have rapport, not before. Sometimes even a non-date becomes a date. It doesn't have to have a label that will just crush everyone under the weight of expectations. If you need to have a game plan, you're already overthinking it.	"I would like to get ...(coffee, beer, dinner, etc) with you" Alternatively, present a properly signed and notarized form 1489-74b from the federal sex bureau.
What skill unrelated to your profession would you want to learn or improve at?	Can we get the mods to just stop adding tags to posts here? Being a mod is supposed to be about supporting the community and the information flow, not soap boxing about your own personal opinions. Yes this is a good question. How is it helpful to the community to have that as a tag on this post?	I would like to learn how to work on cars and motorbikes. Anything mechanical actually. I have a boring ass desk job... Edit: guys thanks so much for the advice, some real good stuff in there and I'll definitely start a project now. Better buy some tools! 👊
Have any of you guys ever went "hermit mode" and stopped being social? If so, why and how?	Deleting social media. Keeping Facebook and Twitter. See a small group of friends semi-regularly - dinner, drinks etc. Live with flatmates, girlfriend and dog. Speak to some friends on Discord while playing games. Use Whatsapp for everything else. It's a nice balance of being lovely and quiet, without being lonely. I'd consider myself a bit of a hermit.	Deleting social media is a good idea, but actually going hermit mode and not interacting with people is terrible for happiness. Find a small group of people you click with and (mostly) ignore the rest. I basically isolated myself in my room for the past year, and it was fairly destructive. I wouldn't recommend doing that.
Those of you who primarily go to chain restaurants when you go out, why don't you hit up your local places?	I assume people that eat at chain restaurants on the regular are the same people who eat salted oatmeal for breakfast everyday. They also probably put catsup on their hotdogs. They should be treated like lepers.	They're safe bets. You know *exactly* what you're getting at a chain restaurant anywhere in the US. The local one-off places are hit or miss and sometimes have more limited menus, so they're a riskier choice for a date or group visit unless you already know the place.
How do you deal with that girlfriend's girlfriend who is always single yet gives "useful" advice that clearly sabotage your long term relationship while your girlfriend considers her BFF?	Quickly & quietly! 😂 Seriously tho, I don't have to. My SO doesn't put up with nonsense from other broads & purposely chooses to have limited female friends/interaction due to most "Bitches being Crazy" She deals with enough of their nonsense on staff, daily. IME, can't say I really blame/disagree with her.	This was a few years ago. I was working nights at the time, so during the day I was fast asleep. My wife woke me up sometime around noon and told me I need to go help her with the yard work. Me, being confused af, ask her why in the hell she's waking me up. It turns out our friendly neighbor-lady saw my wife mowing, and politely informed her that mowing is the "man's job" and my wife should get my lazy ass out of bed to go help. "Honey," I said, "how many times has our neighbor been divorced?" "Oh, shit, you're right. Go back to sleep." And from then on she didn't take any more advice from our neighbor.
Men of reddit, what are things girls think you care about but actually don't?	Make-up for sure. I could care less if my woman wears any as she is just as attractive without it. Though it IS MUCH MORE important that she keeps a 'good' body shape. Fitness is it, and thin is always in...	I dated a girl that bleached her asshole because she was insecure about its pigmentation. I don't care if your butthole is slightly brown or whatever. Just leave it alone FFS.
How many women have you slept with, and were you attracted to every one?	I stopped counting long ago (probably a couple hundred). I was known as a lady's man a very alpha male. Sexual, academic, and work success fell on my lap. Friends joked that I would have a new girl every week to few weeks or so and that was true since mid high school to the end of college. I was not sexually attracted to any of them, but I wanted to be them. I think the guilt was part of the reason I just moved onto the next girl instead of revealing my transgender side.... that and I was still in denial. I was anti-LGBT and it made me feel gross. Then I came out as trans and began transitioning. Since then I have only slept with 1 woman.	Unknown. Most. The crazy thing is that my most active time in life was also my loneliest time in life.
Guys, what encounter have you had with a woman which resulted in a "You're lucky you're hot" thought in mind?	Girls randomly grabbing my beard. That's my fucking face you cunt. But if you're good looking I'll probably let you away with it if I think you might get jigging with me later on	Pretty much every time I see a hot girl. It's a very lucky thing to be hot, and I'm totally envious. Edit: Apparently envy and jealousy are different things! I never knew that.
Men that have cheated during a relationship, how did you manage to get over the guilt and actually improve?	I only ever did it when the relationship was going down the drain and 99% knew she was cheating since a long time. No regrets, but in the future i will just break up.	I see everyone talking about physically cheating. Do you guys consider emotional cheating to be a thing, or do you feel it's only cheating if you have sex with another person? Or did I just misunderstand the title and this was strictly about sex?
What is your take on the modern obsession with traveling?	I think traveling is kinda silly. No matter where you go you're a tourist. You can go places, you can see them, but you're not part of the native culture. You can't understand a place by visiting for 5 minutes, or even for a full year. You're looked at as an outsider who's just passing through. I can't believe there are people arrogant enough to think just because they visited a place, they think they fully understand it or can speak about the local culture or milieu.	Where the hell do you get the money to travel? Do you guys take out loans or something? -from a guy who wants to travel but can't due to no funds
What do I do if my girlfriend of a year is greatly opposed to me getting in shape?	Find a new gf at the gym. You shouldn't be with someone who doesn't want you to be the best person you possibly could be.	She's seeing everything she thinks she ought to do but doesn't want to do. It makes her feel bad because she can't ignore it now that it's in her face.
How unapproachable is the hijab?	If I knew you personally I wouldn't care at first, but then id point out that it looks like a head tissue condom. In the street? Nah, I wouldn't even bother, it kinda makes you invisible in my book.	To be honest, it's very unapproachable in terms of dating. I will be as friendly to you as anyone else, however I will never consider asking you out because I view it as a waste of time due to cultural incompatibility
What purchase for $100 or less has impacted your life the most in the past year?	Waist Cincher, Wig, and Bra for crossdressing, tbh. I know that's not the most manliest thing to write on r/AskMen, but it's been real destressifying to turn into a girl for an hour or two every few weeks or months.	Tongue scraper. This thing is cool as hell and makes my mouth feel much fresher. You can literally see the gunk cascading off of your tongue and you get a little confidence boost knowing your breath will be better. I couldn't believe I hadn't bought one sooner.
How do you get revenge on your worst enemy without breaking the law?	>No serious answers like "get revenge by living a better life" or mature stuff like that Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me. Living well is the best revenge. Suck it.	Put laxative in the water supply. In the Army We were in the field for two weeks Warned all but one crew member to stay away from that particular 5 gallon water jug. That crew member was a fucking asshole. That banged the wife of a squad mate, and tried to slip it to another one's missus He shat non stop for a fortnight
Have you ever backed out of sex with a new person at the last second? What caused it?	She asked me to fist her. I was just like nope not gonna stick my dick in that grand canyon.	We were both really drunk. I nibbled at her neck, or i'd move my hands around, or whatever, and would say, "no, you neeeeeed to stop that", or just "stop", but in a playful way. Every time I stopped she said, "why'd you stop? keep going". It was really uncomfortable for me. After the third or fourth time she did that, I said I can't do it, and I asked her to leave.
People who overcame depression, how the fuck did you do it?	Time to process the hurt. It takes a year and a half (IMHO). You can speed this up somewhat with therapy. A pen and paper is a pretty good therapist. Just write down everything, and think about it. Do it once a week. And, excercise.	Worked on myself and my life 1. Avoided negativity : people , movies,books 2. Study depression ; know your red flags ex: sleeping too much,eating poorly etc.. 3. it takes time and even after 4 years I have some depressive times. 4. Talked about it : seen a psychiatrist and took meds if needed
Why do we find certain clothing/outfits more sexy than the naked body itself?	Nudity isn't inherently sexual. Imagine if it was. There'd be a lot more people with gore fetishes at the very least. It's the sexual potential that's attractive, so naturally, clothing that communicates higher promiscuity or levels of arousal will be sexier. This is especially true if you associate an aesthetic with a personality you find arousing.	I think a big part of it is the mystery, but also I think it excites us because it's they're sexualised items and when a woman wears them, a lot of the time it'll be because she has sex on her mind and wants you to have sex on yours (or more specifically, on the mind of the guys she'd actually have sex with - there's often collateral damage when in public.) So it's both "ooh I wonder what's underneath!" and "oooh this woman is thinking about sex and maybe I have a chance!" Both are exciting. Of course that isn't always the case, but that's how I instinctively respond to seeing it regardless of how I choose act on that response.
Have you ever looked at someone and been like "oh lord, I wish she was mine." Why and who was she?	Nope. >Why Because whilst I've seen incredibly attractive women, I do not know her, nor do I know her personality. While she may be physically attractive, she could have the personality of a brick. So whilst I can look at a girl and say that I'd wanna have sex with her, I can not, nor will not, say that I wish she were my gf (as this title implies)	I met a girl at a friend's birthday party maybe 3 years ago. She was beautiful, charming, funny, she spent a good part of the night talking to me and laughing at my jokes, and she spoke some Ukrainian (which I was trying to learn at the time). Her fiance was also at the party. He seemed like a cool dude, and I came away from the party thinking he's a lucky guy.
How do you feel about tv commercials that make men look stupid and women smart and superior?	Doesn't nearly offend me as much as portraying more black men in advertising than constitute the ethnic proportions in society. I mean, yeah, I get you're trying to prove your company values "diversity" but you're not exactly helping things by focusing too much on a single ethnicity to achieve that goal.	Home Depot has always impressed me by being able to portray both sexes as badass doers. It's really their entire marketing strategy, but they play both genders equally. I get the whole "powerful" mom/female tactic that some companies use, sometimes men look stupid by comparison, I get that. It's hard to build a narrative like this in 30 seconds or less without tilting the scales of intelligence a little to the extreme side, but there's a limit. What annoys me, and I say this as someone who will completely forget about the commercial the moment it ends, is when the husband looks hopeless and like a full retard, like he's a danger to his children. In an age where the father/husband role is constantly being undermined through gatekeeping and such it bothers me when commercials portray the husband as having a negative influence in a family.
Men of Askmen who have lived with female roommates what was the level of modesty around the house ? Did you discussed this beforehand ?	If one of them secretly wants you, that one will flaunt their body accidentally. If two of them secretly wants you, it can get ugly. This is how women work. Normally, none of them will want the male house mate, and you won't see any immodesty at all or if it does happen, it will be focused privately so only you see it.	I'm a guy who lived with 3 female roommates for a summer. We never talked about modesty, and we all just wore a towel around our bits when leaving the bathroom after a shower. It just was unspoken courtesy. We walked around in our underwear which nobody seemed to mind. We were rarely sober and a very merry bunch, so it was a pretty relaxed atmosphere.
Guys who left an SO for someone else, what was your experience like and was the grass greener?	The grass was greener we had a great vibe and a positive personality. My past girlfriend I stayed longer than I should have because i was blinded by her beauty and the sex was amazing. She was a squirter need I say more	I absolutely regretted it almost immediately and if I could go back in time I would not have made the same choice. TL;DR: Throughout High School I was massively obsessed with a girl. In college I met a girl who was better for me in every way and we started dating. The first girl got in contact with me and confessed that she's wanted to date me for the past year. I broke up with the second girl for the first. The first girl cheated and then broke up with me.
In your experience, what are the differences between having sex with skinny girls, chubby girls and athletic girls?	Chubby girls are NOT my thing. Never have never will. I prefer athletic bodies. There's nothing greater than a girl who squats.	Skinny girls: You can man handle them. Toss em around. Hold them up hold them down, etc etc. Lots of possibilities. Chubby: Typically pretty fucking good at sex honestly. There is the long touted myth of them being great at head and I've only received evidence of it being true. Also been ridden *EXCEPTIONALLY* well by a "chubby" girl. Athletic: Their bodies are just amazing to see naked really. Not much difference from a skinny girl to an athletic girl. Other than the muscles in legs/stomach that you'll some times see that can be cool if that's your cup of tea.
What are some trivial things that you silently judge other men for?	A few others for me: * Not knowing the names Jimmy Page, Keith Richards, and David Gilmour * Not having seen Star Wars * Ordering steak cooked more than medium rare	Guys who are exclusively nice to girls. It's actually pretty comical when a douche completely changes his behavior as soon as a girl walks in the room and completely worships and white knights for her lol.
What is your most memorable "This bitch is crazy" moment?	When she made a soap opera out of me not talking about our issue through texting. She had a mental breakdown over two days of not texting while I was figuring things out. Plus she's incessantly childish and demands attention 24/7 when I'm in her presence. When I look away for too long she moves my hand. No joke. Why are all women crazy?	I made some flippant remark she didn't like. She gestured like she was going to stab me in the hand with a pen. I said she wouldn't. She did.
Caught my girlfriend going through my PC and phone, how to handle this?	You're chicks crazy man! She doesn't trust you for shit and is trying to dig up shit by invading your privacy and not asking. Throw the hoe out!	It really depends on how you feel about this girl, which you haven't told us. If you think there could be a future with her, you need to talk to her about trust and boundaries. If you're just having fun, break up with her. The whole point of a casual relationship is so you don't have to deal with stuff like this.
How can I date in a college town without being the "creepy older guy hitting on college girls"?	You're going to have to move to a new town. I'm 28 and at this point, I would feel uncomfortable dating 22 or 23-year-olds. It's only going to get worse. I visited Gainesville, Florida, earlier this year, and when I went out I felt like a complete creep even though I wasn't interested in hitting on anyone, I just felt like I was regarded that way because I was surrounded by 22-year-olds. I'm not even 30 yet. I wouldn't date below 24/25. When I'm 29 I think 24-year-olds will be too young for me.	If you don't go to student hangouts to pick up, it will solve 80% of this problem. The other 20% can be solved by asking early in the conversation what she does. If the answer is 'I'm a fresher/sophomore/junior/senior' then politely excuse yourself.
What is a small issue that you're very passionate about?	Gum. Gum should be banned. It serves no purpose and makes every public walkway look like shit. PS, you can just swallow it and nothing bad happens, asshole.	People leaving shopping carts all over grocery store parking lots. It's a constant reminder of how fucking lazy everyone is, and that I hate them.
If you ever ghosted anyone (especially if you were in an actual committed relationship), how do you feel about it now?	Done it so many times I can't even remember them all. I don't really care because it's over the internet - it doesn't feel like real life, even though it has real life consequences.	I dated a girl for about a month when I was 19 who wasn't on the pill. During sex she kept telling me to finish in her then broke down crying when I didn't. Needless to say I didn't talk to her afterwards. She didn't really try to contact me much afterwards, I think she understood that I didn't want to put up with that crazy shit.
My parents dropped the bomb yesterday.. they're separating. Men of AskMen who have been in this situation, how have you coped and helped you family cope?	Idolizing your parents marriage is easy, but keep in mind, they wouldn't be separating if they were happy. Just treat your dad the same as you would always have, and if you notice him struggling emotionally, lend a hand.	I was the same age as you. Realise that this is **their** shit to work through, that there is nothing you can do about it, that they are still your parents and they still love you and you can still love them, that you are still a family even though you might not be together, and try to not let them force you into siding with one or the other. You're an adult, they're adults. They can confide in you, but don't let their opinion of each other affect your opinion of them. Basically, treat it like the break-up of two very close friends, neither of whom you can side with over the other, and let them handle it. If they try to be childish with each other, remind them to be fucking adults and deal with it as such rather than drag you in.
Gentlemen of Reddit, what's the weirdest reason you aren't someone's "type"?	I treated her too well, she was having feelings (because apparently all of her exes were douche-bags), and couldn't take a married guy home to meet mom.	I was once flirting with a girl in a bar when I was 19 amd she was 20 or 21. The topic of age came up in conversation. She estimated me to be about 23, and when I told her the truth she excused herself and said she would never date a younger guy. I find that a very odd idea, especially given that she clearly seemed interested before when she thought I was older...
What are some things you notice/pay attention to when you first enter a woman's room or house?	Where the female stuff is: panties, make up, teddy bears, etc Also, the smell. Usually, girls room smells very unique and nice. Also, I can know more about a girl by looking at her room's stuff, So I end noticing every detail that gives me information regarding the girl, like a detective	The smell. That's the first thing that registers in my mind before I notice anything visually. If it smells bad then the game has already been lost
What is the worst entrapment a girl has ever tried to pull on you?	After reading these comments, I will never feign a pregnancy to keep a guy with me. That is horrible. Also, I'm really glad the guys who have called me "crazy" in the past obviously have no idea what they're talking about. I've never done half this shit. Lol Edit: Okay, I thought it was obvious but I guess not. I have not considered this before, and what I meant by my comment was I wouldn't ever consider it "after reading these comments". I appreciate all the judgments, but keep your own personal motives off my shit. Thanks.	My first serious girlfriend with whom we said I love you and all that broke up with me as a way to test me and see if I would fight to get her back. I didn't... Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Amirite?
Guys with girl best friends (who aren't SOs) - what's the modesty situation like between you guys?	Same with a male best friend, if it was actually 100% platonic I wouldn't show my butt / junk to her, and wouldn't be looking for hers. But then again, I would never have a female best friend.	Never seen her private bits or her boobs or butt. I'm not going to show her mine either. That's not something I share with just friends, even if we're besties.
What should everyone know about partying?	The usual guideline for buying drinks for a party is to reserve two drinks per person for the first hour, and one drink per person for every hour after that. That's a good baseline, if you don't know your tolerances. I also like to stop drinking at least ten hours before I plan to wake up, and go to bed with an ibuprofen, to prevent hangovers.	Drink but know your limits. After the evening drink at least 5 cups of water, maybe more since hangover is not really fun. When you dance just don't give a shit about what you look like, imagine you are in an empty room, like another poster said focus on having fun not looking like you are having fun.
fellow men, do you ever not feel unwanted, and how do you get over it?	Be a man and shrug the feels off. It happens to me sometimes but I just ignore such feelings. Sometimes you just need to dump your old useless friends. Take up a hobby or something and you can meet great people. That is what I did and it worked for me. If your family is plain shite, limit your interaction with them. I did that and I never felt better. Can't help you in the girlfriend/wife department as I have no such luck with women.	Honestly, most men use work for this. It's a major contributing factor to why men make more money. We don't usually feel like we're desired or wanted in relationships, we often always feel the ones providing. So work is where a lot of men work hard to get the feeling of being wanted at work.
How would you feel if the brother or father of a woman you were dating gave you a "warning"?	Yeah it's a threat......... so what? Any father worth his salt will scare the shit out of you for at least a little while, Same thing with brothers. What's the big deal?	"If you hurt her, I'll hurt you worse." "And what if she hurts me?" They never know how to answer that.
Men of Reddit, what can a man do that will cause you to end your friendship with them?	Be flighty or a liar. Be afraid to get in a fight (not be a douchey fight-starter, but afraid to fight at all and actively avoiding it at all cost. I like my friends to have my back if I have theirs). Of course, the fighting part is less valuable the older you get (I haven't been in a proper fight in almost 10 years and I probably never will again), but I feel like fighting is a part of growing up and you are really naive in general if you haven't been in one	Eh I've told this story many times but why not again. Had a really old friend. I got married and had a kid. He got married but got divorced. Had a drinking problem. He moved back to my area and then every time we hung out he would 1) get really, really drunk and annoying and 2) basically just bitch at me about how I'm a bad friend for not hanging out more Finally we got into an argument about this and we stopped talking.
What are some red flags to watch out for in daily life?	Women posting about feminism on social media. Now, I'm all for equality, but feminism is a scary animal. And women sharing pay gap bullshit on social media are the most hateful people in general when you get to know them.	When the temperature outside suddenly drops about 10-20 degrees and things start getting a bit quiet. Also, if you see animals suddenly start hiding or making a run for it en masse. You should probably find shelter.
What do women do that they think is romantic, but men actually find cringey?	Ex I was dating bought me a rose once. Got mad when I let it die cause I forgot to put it in water.	I dated someone who was more interested in sharing with others that we were in a relationship than actually being present in the relationship. Like an over exaggeration of our romance. Selfies galore, it was exhausting. I think what did it for me was when I took her out to enjoy a sunset, she snapped a "perfect" picture and decided she wanted to go. The sunset was a fluid 30 minute event, how are you satisfied with a moment's snapshot?
Dads whats going through your mind when meeting your daughters boyfriend for the first time?	As a Brother with a lil sister. Just be normal, but watchful. Does he shake your hand right, does he look you in the eye when talking to you, since this is his first time meeting you he should probably call you sir.	Don't have kids old enough to be in this situation, but I can tell you my father-in-law's approach of saying, "So, have you fucked my daughter yet?" is absolutely the wrong approach.
Guys that cheated on their SO and were forgiven. How's that relationship going?	It's going great. Went from GF to Wife. It was definitely rocky at times afterward and took time to rebuild trust. Been over a year now since the incident and I'd say we are in a perfect place. I'm sure she still has her own moments, internally, where she questions things but she has always had jealousy problems that she constantly reminds me of.	Girlfriend and I both cheated on each other during a very unhealthy relationship. We broke up but got back together 6 months later. We then enjoyed a fairly decent 3.5 year relationship before she cheated on me again. I guess I thought if I changed, then she would too. I was wrong.
Men, What makes you decide to be single?	"Decide" Mmmkay lets go with that. So let's look at pros and cons to being in a relationship and if it's worth the time, money, and effort. Rewards: possible sex. Possible future awesome wife. Possible kids. Almost guaranteed good times. Post-marriage marriage/kids tax write offs. Slim chance at getting a sugar momma. Risks: possible STDs. Possible no return on investments. Possible future shitty or abusive wife. Probable divorce, with likely outcome of kids going to her custody. Meanwhile I'm happy doing what I already do everyday. I feel like it's not worth actively searching for a relationship. If I want a family and I feel financially comfortable I'll adopt a kid and parent my own way.	I haven't really "decided" to be single. I am pretty happy as is and if you're not adding to my happiness, then I don't really think I need to make an investment of time into a relationship. That sounds super pretentious I suppose, but I feel like unless I really enjoy hanging with the other person, it's not worth the effort. Would I like to be in a relationship just to be in a relationship to fulfill human interaction needs? No. Would I like to be in a relationship because I value the other person and they enhance my day to day life in ways I can't alone? Ab-so-fucking-loutely.
Men of Reddit, what are the biggest regrets you have during your time in college?	I wish i fucked more girls and got better grades. I finally got accepted to grad school, but it took 3 applications.	- Too much binge drinking, not enough real socializing. - Should have gotten in shape physically. There's all kinds of classes and facilities available to try different things. - I didn't take classwork seriously enough. You can follow the syllabus and get a degree, but there's tons of opportunity to take part in various research projects etc that will be way more valuable in your career.
What was your last straw with a former friend, where you said I don't ever want to see this person again?	My friend was hanging out with a girl he knew I liked one on one and ended up making moves on her. He denied it when I brought it up. I just moved on at that point. I don't need that caustic behavior from strangers, let alone friends of years.	When I got home and his shot was moved out of our apartment and his dad had bought us out of the lease and he told me I had till the end of the month to find somewhere to live. This was after 6 months of eating my food, invading and disrespecting my space. And thinking that his girlfriend could run the apartment that she didn't live in.
What's a subtly hot way of letting him see me naked for the first time?	Have you tried opening your mouth like an adult and just telling him what you want and what you're comfortable with and having a conversation about your relationship and the speed you want to take things at? I know it's a crazy idea, but it's one of those ideas that is so crazy it might just work.	Hey "Johnny," can you come here for a sec? *Wait for him to enter your room.* *Drop the bathrobe from your shoulders.* Does my birthday suit still fit me? *Laugh*
What interesting sexual habits did you came across when you were in a relationship?	Way more subs than doms. Especially among men. It is true for both sexes. But with men it seems like 90% women like 80%. Assuming that they are into it at all. Not general population. Edit I made a mistake my bad I won't change it since it makes people laugh. My point is of people into bdsm. The overwhelming majority of both sexes are submissive. Huge shortage of doms, I do not know why.	My boyfriend now loves when I wear my aprons in the kitchen. Sometimes if I want to get laid, I wear my really feminine girl dress, throw an apron on and have dinner for him when he comes home. Often times, dinner is cold by the time we get to it. I have many aprons now.
How do you build/maintain attraction with your SO?	Romantic love doesn't last - you can try and force and fake it but it never works. There's a point where a mental switch is needed - let go of the magic and welcome in reality - and reality says lasting relationships are partnerships, not Gabriel Garcia Marquez love stories lasting 50 years.	Keep doing fun things together. Be interested in their life/goals/dreams. Keep working on yourself (physically but not only) to stay (or become more) attractive. Also something that worked for me is semi regular (sexual) teasing when you're not together followed by awesome sex afterwards. The level of this heavily depends on both people involved of course but it's something I personally love doing and has worked in the past..
What are things that you cut out of your life (or cut back on) that made you better/happier?	Excess money. Work to live, don't live to work. Don't accumulate or hoard money for a "future" that probably isn't going to happen anyway. Retirement, owning a home, etc etc, it's all bollocks.	I stopped drinking during the week because it was making me tired and not motivated to do things like clean the house. So far it's been very positive.
How can I be sexually assertive without it coming off as pushy?	There's an app called text now. Its free and its basically a new number you can use whenever you have internet. Give him that number. Hook up that way.	If he's within the 90% of average guys, he'll have no problem with you going after him. From a guy's perspective, I wish more women would be comfortable making the first move. Write your number down for him, and say "Call me, let's have drinks/dinner/whatever". You don't have to say you want the D... he'll know. Tackle him at the knees when you meet.
Describe why you love her so much?	She's cute, sarcastic (like, savagely) which is a huge turn on for me, smart, interested in my hobbies but has her own, and just genuinely fun to be around. Pity she's with someone else (LDR), possibly moving away, and 8 years younger than me. Fuck. I'll find someone else, but for now she's dominating my thoughts and it's miserable. Yet we keep hanging out.	I'm attracted to her in ways I have never felt before. There's no one single thing I'm attracted to, it's all of her. She's funny but thinks I'm funnier (I'm probably not) She's really intelligent but feels no need to have anyone else know it She does the *right* thing, always choosing to be a better person, every day She has a really nice bum we've been married for almost 20 years.
Why does depression seem to be a common and almost boasted thing?	When you 'have' depression and/or anxiety it gives you a blank slate to be as much of a minging little twat as you want and nobody says anything. It's basically a way to absolve yourself of all responsibility. "Sorry I didn't pick you up at the airport, I was having an anxiety attack" "sorry I skipped out date, I was depressed and decided to play vidya for five hours" Of course the vast majority of these 'depressed people' have never been diagnosed or been treated for it. Basically an untouchable free pass to be a spoiled little shit.	Depression is a serious issue, but I think there are people who self-diagnose and use it as an excuse against doing things they don't like.
Why do so many men hate high waisted jeans on women?	*a wild feminist appears* What if I told you not everything women do has to be met with men's approval? I like high waisted styles and I'ma keep doing me. Edit: Waiting for all the downvotes, but I regret nothing.	It takes a very specific body type to look good in them, and that body type would look so much better in almost anything else.
Gamers: how do you find time to focus on your career, have a good relationship with friends/family/SO and still have time to play games?	I couldn't. And I realized that as life went on I was just going to waste more and more hours of it on something that will give absolutely nothing back to me. So I sold my system. Absolutely freeing, and now I use the time I would have wasted on much better things.	Moderation. Video-games are good entertainment, but they're still just that - entertainment. They should be used as a hobby or time-suck when you don't have anything else to do. It's an insular activity that doesn't really enrich you or make you better generally (though some games tell good stories or test your problem solving skills), so it's certainly not a bad thing to have better or more important things to do. I'm saying this as someone who really likes video games by the way. With work, a fiancee, my social life, and the gym, I don't get as much time to play as I used to, but the things I'm doing instead are either more important (gym, work) or more enjoyable.
I keep seeing guys ask what they should have to impress girls they bring over, so I'm curious, what would you like to see at a girl's place?	1. Collection of the heads of her slain enemies. Failing that, at least their ears (I understand apartments are getting smaller nowadays) 2. Birth control bottle prominently placed on the bathroom vanity would be a nice touch too. 3. Decent six pack of craft beer or bottle of whiskey 4. Preferably 0 cats, but certainly not more than 1 cat 5. A friendly dog 6. Vidya console 7. Bookshelf filled with actual literature instead of old textbooks or unopened art and philosophy texts	A clean place. I work hard to keep mine clean. If I were dating, it would be among the top things I'd be noticing about a date's place.
What sexual act will you never perform (again), and why?	Crossdressing as well team domming... I hated the pseudo lesbian crap because those ball crushinh underwear are like getting kicked in the nads all day. We tied down this big dude and "served the matriarchy" over "some freaking dude". We took turns with it. And on shark week, we took a trip to brokeback. The crossdressing was pretty... Brian Molko... but could dress sluttier.	The one where she says "let's role play as sea creatures!" and proceeds to act like a starfish. edit: i was an elephant seal and a sea cucumber.
Will you ever ditch your girl friend for your gf? Why or why not?	I stopped going out with my girl friends who happened to be fwbs, alone. Only in groups with my gf there. Or a really large group. Out of respect. They still come over to chill though. My gf is completely aware of how our cohort works, doesn't have a problem. (I vet for that in an s.o.)	I don't disagree with the others but as soon as he said "I'm willing to hide it" I got a really bad vibe. Either he is aware that his relationship is bunk and he doesn't want to leave, or he knows being with you may cross some lines. I am ever the optimistic and well guess he is done with the relationship. But as soon as secret friends becomes a thing I get weirded out.
Men of reddit who cheated death by missing a flight, calling in sick, missed bus. What happened? Did it change the way you live your life?	Couple of occasions of passing a street away from a stabbing attack last year when I was living in Jerusalem, one time at Mahane Yehuda market, the second time in the Old City. Oh, one more stabbing on a Tel Aviv-Jerusalem bus I could have taken. In all honesty, I couldn't care less, as most Israelis do. Shit happens all the time and as long as it doesn't touch you.. one is not inclined to dwell too much on the "what if"s	A guy I once knew was responding to a gas leak, tried to squeeze through a traffic lighted junction, but didn't make it to the line in time and had to wait for a full rotation to green. Pulled up at the address, and the building blew up as he exited the vehicle. Had he have made it through the lights, he'd have been literally knocking on the door of a bomb as it went off. I don't believe he changed at all, and shrugged it off to being extremely fucking lucky.
I'm 22 years old. If you were 22 again, what would you do differently?	Take that hot girl with the sparkle eyes who was just that chill and marry her, so I could dominate her daily while we were still young, and force her hips to squirt out the children our bodies were designed to be parenting at that age. Staying up all night sucks when you get to your mid-thirties, not to mention the increased risk of genetic deformity. Money is over-rated, items and "friends" are overrated. Do it like your grandparents and their grandparents and their grandparents, like your body was created to do. Have them early, and often, and tell "the world" to shove their judgement up their empty heads. They got plenty of space in the empty bank in their chests.	"take college seriously and do not drop out" *7 upvotes* "take college less seriously and improve my social life" *7 upvotes* hmmm
What embarrassing thing did you do and hope no one will ever find out?	A few years ago I was working as an architect on an 80 year old local state monument and accidentally gave George Washington crossed eyes due to a screw up in the schematics. I had been working late and I was on the verge of finishing the design, or upkeep to be specific, and emailed them before double checking them. Unfortunately, my boss caught on and was furious but tried to contain her rage before she pulled me into her office and, with the fury of God she yells, "In nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table!"	I tell people I got into martial arts and boxing because when I was 11 I was beat up by two 16 year old kids. Great sob story, yadda yadda. I leave out the fact that I literally pissed my pants during that incident and the sheer embarrassment of wetting myself has driven me all these years.
Men who didn't start dating until later in life, how did things turn out?	If you make good money, that's all that matters. Use that degree to make money, then you can advertise yourself on a dating website or something. If you have the means to provide a good life, you'll find a woman.	I had gone on a small collection of accidates and ill-informed dates, but my first proper date, where we both knew it was a date prior, happened at 24. That was 10 years ago. I've made some missteps, but taking a good amount of time to really get into helped me observe other people's relationships and decide what qualities I did and didn't want in mine. Go into dating because you want to. Not because "It's time", and not to "correct" the fact that you've not had a relationship.
How the fuck do I buy an engagement ring without knowing my girlfriend's ring size?	Think twice about signing your life away dude. Note the divorce rate. Note that prenups aren't valid in many countries. No reason you can't just live together until "one of you" changes their minds. And she will.	Stick her finger in your mouth while asleep and hold your lips in that position till you find the time to visit a jeweller...
How do I avoid "girlfriend-zoning" my female friends?	Eh... Here is some old dude advice. Guys don't have girl...friends. They have potential sexual partners. You are no different than any other guy. You are friendlier to certain girls because that is what we do. The problem isn't "girlfriend zoning" whatever the f'k that is. The problem is that you cant close the deal. Your question is probably more like...how do I get girls that I like to have sex with me. That is the question all guys have. Edit: here comes the your-opinion-sucks brigade. The difference between us is that I don't have pretenses	That never goes away buddy. Just learn to respect boundaries. Dont get drunk and have sex with them. Dont touch them inappropriately or make jokes about yall hooking up. Its about establishing boundaries and respecting your female friends enough not to cross those boundaries. This is never going away, so start establishing these expectations now and in a few years you will be a pro at it. Plus, these women will respect the absolute fuck out of you because most men do not follow these boundaries and disrespect them by crossing over them. Its just part of life for women. So dont add to the bullshit they have to deal with.
Men, how do I (F) know when I should give someone my number without them asking for it?	Twisted standards here. So it's out of place for a guy to do this kind of stuff to a girl while she's working but not vice versa? WTF	Can you read minds? - Yes: Then read them. - No: Just go with your intuition. Write the number on the cup or whatever. This is the crux in all human interaction. We can't read minds. You need to risk something.
How do you deal with losing friends in your 20's?	Get involved in your local dance scene. I started learning how to salsa a few years ago and found a community there. It's a great workout too.	I'm 39, and I think what you describe is extremely common. It just takes a lot more effort to maintain relationships as you get older. People get busy with their careers, advanced schooling, starting families, personal issues, etc. Friendships typically take a back seat to all those things. My advice would be to focus on the quality of your friendships, rather than the ~~quality~~ quantity. If you have even just one or two real friends, you can consider yourself pretty lucky. Getting old sucks. Edit: sorry for the typo.
Men of AskMen, what's the most Macgyver thing you've ever done?	I bought a Christmas tree, but it turned out some of the lower branches made it unable to fit into the holder. I didn't have a saw, so I ended up taking my drill and drilling holes in the branches until I was able to break them off by hand.	I didn't get any solar glasses, so just an hour ago I threw together a pinhole camera for today's eclipse while at work using a frozen burrito box, a soda bottle cap, a thumbtack, and some tape. It's sitting right next to me on my desk. I love astronomy, but I'm also a huge procrastinator.
Men who are dating to or married to extremely hot women, what problems do you have to face?	I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance. So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness.	My lady is pretty hot and Im very trusting, but the truth is I get over protective the moment she feels uncomfortable. She has this certain fake smile and awkward laugh and its like my bat ~~symbol~~ signal. Edit: signal
What did you think of sex after your first time?	It wasn't mind blowing amazing. But I knew it would get better after come practise. Well over 2000 times later it's pretty good. I know how to pleasure a woman in many many ways. Even how to achieve the 3 different orgasms you can give her. 1. Basic orgasm. 2. Full on. Also known as deep or giant. 3. Rolling or multiple.	SLightly dissapointed. Kinda. Like yes it was awesome, sex IS aweseome but it wasn't life changing or anything. I was the same guy I was before except I'd lost my V card.
I am an East Asian guy dating a White girl who is a weaboo, how can I talk to her about how uncomfortable it makes me?	TIL girls are into you because your Asian wtf, remember the days that girls weren't into Asians ? Pepperidge farm remembers	I don't think you are giving enough context to get great advice. Is it making you feel uncomfortable because she is fetishizing you and only like you because you are Asian? Is it uncomfortable because she may have stereotyped you and falsely thought you would have shared interests as her? Either way, imo just be honest, articulate, and direct about what is it that's bothering you.
What's your "right person wrong timing" story?	My current boyfriend. We met through a mutual friend freshman year and really liked each other but never got to hang out since he lived a couple cities over. we always kept in touch but finally started seeing each other romantically senior year but since it took him and hour or more to ride his bike to my house and because we both became too busy, we slowly stopped seeing each other. I was heart broken, id always loved him to death so 6 months later, as soon as i got my car, the first thing i did was drive to him. It took over 4 years for us to end up together but worth the wait. We live together now but i remember all the nights we stayed up all night on the phone and how i'm really lucky to wake up next to him every day.	My last Ex. Graduated with her Bachlor's trying to get her career started and I was just barely re-starting community college. We had a lot in common and had good chemistry so we dated. 9 months later she got a temp job in another state. Tried to make long distance work, but she didn't wanna do it anymore. I don't hate her, but man moving on has been difficult.
Guys, what have been your experiences when going on a "break" with a girl?	Most likely she found a more attractive dick, but she hasn't been able to seal the deal yet. If she can't she'll come back to you.	Ive never been so naive to fall for that. It's basically a non commital breakup that gives the relationship a kiss of death.
Men, what is your go-to when you're feeling depressed?	Do more stuff that scares the shit out of you. Fear is just natural response. Don't shy away from it. Next to that Depression is just your body telling you: "Dude you're supposed to do other things with your life." Conclusion... what you're supposed to do is in that area where you experience fear.	Meditation and breathing. I still contemplate things as deeply as possible, but remaining grounded in the moment is so much more important to me now. Asking "why" and trying to deconstruct what's making me unhappy can be an endless endeavor if I let it, so staying in the moment via mindfulness turned out to be paramount to letting go of those things and allowing myself to be truly happy.
What about you makes you a catch to date?	I'm one of the few people who are actually pretty unique in my life experiences. I have lived extensively in Africa, Europe, America - and not studying abroad or anything, that obviously does not count. Grew up during a civil war. I speak three languages. I played soccer semi professionally and was a touring musician for a couple years. I'm good looking, full head of hair, am told I look very very similar to Zayn Malik (my friends disabled younger sister is still convinced im him haha). Work in the medical field. Am 25 years old and as long as shes hot I am very down to eat ass	Late 30's, no children, professional career who lives alone and is in decent shape. I feel like the white stag.
When you go out to a club/pub on a Friday night, is it imperative that you should be with a group of people? Is it viable for an average looking single guy to go out at night alone and still drink, chat women up and possibly something more without coming off as creepy?	just go with friends, you'll have a much better time just dancing and having fun and meeting girls that way rather than approaching them and being creepy	Become a regular at a pub/bar. Then you can drink alone and you will still have friends there. If you are friendly with the staff they will be friendly back. When you are alone and the staff is all talking to you and paying attention to you girls at the bar will notice this and no longer consider you to be alone. I used to frequent a bar near my condo and I would get picked up by the waitresses and bartenders, usually when they finish working and the bar is still open because they know me and come sit beside me at the bar for a drink after their shift.
Do you feel physically uncomfortable when a girl is sitting/laying on you?	At least in America, 123 is definitely below the average, especially for someone who's 5'7. In general though, it's generally pretty comfortable to have a girl sitting/lying on you with a few exceptions: -She's sitting on my thigh in just a way so it's pushing right down on the bone -She's pushing down on my non-empty bladder -She's laying on my arm in such a way that she's cutting off circulation -She's a bony girl and her hips/butt feel like knives Other than the last one, those are easily rectified. You're not as heavy as you think.	I was on a date and she wanted to snuggle in the theatre. I'm wearing layers because it's December and I feel the sweat coming in the pit she is resting in. Then my arm goes numb from lack of blood. I asked her if she wanted to reposition and she said she was fine. So I let it be. Moana was the longest movie of my life.
Why does toilet paper fall out of my guy friend's pants?	I'm like 100% sure he stands up to wipe his ass and toilet paper being shitty (hah) it shreds a bit while he's wiping. Some of it falls down into his pants, underwear and on the floor. If they don't notice it on the rim of the toilet seat it's because **he** notices it and wipes it off. He must not realize it collects in other places or maybe he does and just doesn't care. But I'm 100% sure of what I said here. I would put money on it. source: Happens to me but It doesn't collect in my pants lol	I once had an anal fistula, basically like a boil beside the butthole which will never heal, that will leak fluid (sometimes blood if you scratch it or wipe too hard) I spent a few years with a tissue wedged in there (graduated to a band-aid and surgical mesh when it got worse) Eventually saw a doctor, it was diagnosed and surgically removed. I'm pretty sure this is what your friend is going through.
How awkward was the first time you bought condoms?	I was 16. I approached the cashier and handed her the condoms. She said "I think you have to be 18 to buy those." I said "you need to be 18 to practice safe sex?" 5 second awkward pause, after which she flushed a bright red and just rang them up, took the money, gave me the change and receipt, and didn't say another word as I picked up the bag and left.	What you said is waaaaaay more awkward than buying condoms. What uncle sends his nephew into the store to buy condoms for him?
How do guys feel about a girl wearing a hair bonnet to bed?	Why aren't you asking him? You're not in bed with r/askmen are you? And if you are, where's my slice? *Additionally, I'm black too, I have naturally tight micro twists, they look awesome. I've never, ever, in my life, been told or advised to wear a hair bonnet.*	I'd be sleeping tf would I care what you put on your head go ask your dude because even if every single user here says one thing or the other, that won't give you any closer idea as to what he'd think
What is the most offensive thing you've ever said?	I would call your remark "black humor" or "gallows humor". The disturbing thing is quite a number of people in Asia actually believe this about animals, and do in fact torture them before consuming them.	The one I feel the worst about was probably because it wasn't intended unlike most of the offensive comments I make. I was in the middle of a high school class, and one of the dorkier girls (you know the ones big coke bottle glasses, always reminding the teacher about homework, but not actually that smart) was wearing a t-shirt supporting ice hockey. Trying to be nice since everyone else gave her a hard time, I tapped her on the shoulder and said "do you play or just watch?" I realized I fucked up when I saw the look on her face and my buddies started laughing. She storms off in a huff and I dumbfoundedly try to figure out where I fucked up when I see it was a shirt supporting special olympics hockey. 15 years later I still feel bad about it.
Is it safe to say all guys look at naked girls online, like insta and reddit?	There was a study that attempted to find how porn effected men's views of the opposite sex. In the study they attempted to find just 50 men who never watched porn. They couldn't find 50 and gave up on the study. So keep that in mind, all men view it. However, it's not an emotional thing for us. Some men just look at naked women the same way they look at pictures of new Ferrari's. You admire the beauty of it, but you know that driving that car is a huge pain the ass and all around not enjoyable of a car to have at all and you'd much prefer your 3 year old Honda. However it doesn't mean it's not nice to look at. Porn star and attractive women are like the Ferrari, great to look at but almost always a pain in the ass to be around.	I'd say it's typically a bad idea to over-generalize, but I'd say it's safe to say the majority of straight men in the western world look at porn/erotica of some sort. I think your desire for a little discretion is reasonable. Let him look at porn, but show him how to open an incognito browser window. I think hoping for a guy who only jerks off to images in his head may be a little fantastic. Porn is just too easy to access to expect someone not to access it.
My GF doesn't really have friends. How can I talk to her about it?	Making friends isn't a terribly difficult thing to do. If she wanted to, she would. Some people don't keep a big circle of friends because they just don't want them. There doesn't have to be a deeper meaning than that. I spend all my time with my girlfriend, because we live together. Apart from that I can count on one hand with finger to spare the amount of people I spend any appreciable amount of time with. I'm fine with this. People are a drain.	I don't understand what you intend to talk to her about. The fact that you feel guilty isn't her problem. If you feel bad for hanging out with your friends (which makes no sense), maybe bring her once in a while or do more stuff with her. Badgering her over her lack of friends isn't "helping" her. Why don't you just take her word that she's fine staying home alone when you go out with your friends? Allot of people actually like having time alone. My wife doesn't have a lot of female friends and she doesn't mind at all if I go out with my male friends. She likes to stay home and work on her hobbies alone or go shopping alone. Not all women are social butterflies.
Men who managed to find and get back "the one who got away", what's your story, how long did it take?	Ok no native english speaker here... 3 weeks... (does it counts?) First of all i wasn't really in loved with her, we were just "good friends" and had a lot of sex, one day i didn't took my phone to job and she called, she went crazy because i "ignored her" and said "i don't want to see you ever again", she blocked me on facebook, whatsapp, etc and i blocked her calls. (I started missing her at this point)... 3 weeks later she tried to add me on facebook again but i didn't accepted, then she called me from another phone crying and saying "listen to me please", afyer a while we agreed to be just friends, she called me home next day and asked me to be her bf, curretly dating her :)	Not sure if this counts... We dated in 2008, for a few months, broke up because of me, I regretted my decision, but we stayed close friends. I chased her for years, bending over backwards for her in an attempt to prove my worth, making it known that I'll always be there. By 2017... I told her I was done, and planned to move one and that wouldn't change our friendship. Within a week of me telling her, she told me she had done some thinking and wanted to be with me. I looked her in the eye, despite thinking this is all I wanted for the better half of a decade, I said no.
Ok lady speaking here... I'm really wanting some perspective on why you decided you wanted children or didn't?	I had a son so I have an heir, keep my surname alive, hopefully he will do well and I can be proud of him. Oh and also when I'm old and feeble I will have someone who will (hopefully) check in on me.	I'm selfish with my free time. Perhaps it comes off as a man child answer but its true. Can't see myself giving that up to have kids. Surely, my decision to not have kids will come back to bite me in the ass later on in life, but that is the consequence I have to live with.
What do you consider "leading you on"?	When she sends you chocolate covered strawberries on Valentines Day but wont go out to dinner with you what a slut.	In college I asked a girl out, she said yes but she was busy that weekend. I tried to reschedule the next friday and the next saturday. After so many "I'm busy now how bout later?" I just told her that the ball was in her court. That was 100% leading me on. I liked her, she seemed to like me. She was super flirty even when cancelling and 'rescheduling'. Just made me feel like crap.
What's your favorite type of girl to date?	Lookswise? Short, busty, sandy blonde hair, blue or hazel eyes, my gods, they're a treat to look at and a ton of fun in bed. Relationship-wise? Women who have seen some of the world, who work hard but don't tie their self-worth into their paycheck, educated (and not just in terms of a degree; I'd rather have a girl with an associate's in English or history than a girl with an MBA who skated humanities as an undergrad), yet with a naturally submissive, feminine nature. So basically, a girl-next-door sweetheart with a brain.	The comfortable ones. You know you meet some people and you just feel the need to be guarded around them? And then there are other people where, even if you've just met, you're so much more willing to be open with them than with others? Like, you feel as though you can be yourself and they won't judge you? They're a tough kind to find but they save worry, time, and they're usually just great to be around. The kind of girl where you can just say that stupid thought you just had ("do you think dogs have a favorite type of poop or puke to eat, like solid poos or white ones?") and even if you get a "What the fuck?" look you know she'll move past it.
What are you ashamed to admit has happened to you more than once?	Accidates. I've just now gotten to the point where I've had more actual dates than accidental. And a few months ago, I STILL had an accidate.	Woke up at night. Didn't turn on the light. Grabbed a mug. Poured water into it. Splashes out. "Holy shit that overflowed fast". Turn on the light. Mug is upside down
What the hell do you do in the evenings to keep yourself entertained if not drink yourself into a stupor?	Kratom Seriously, if you have a drinking problem or are starting to find yourself just drinking to pass time, kratom is the best thing that can happen to you. It's not really mind-altering, is 1000x healthier and about 20x cheaper. It gets rid of the desire to drink *completely*. ETA: Jesus, downvotes for trying to help remedy a problem?	Typically if I'm at home for the night, I'll just play video games or go for a run. I also may try to get caught up on homework, but that only really is an option if you're in college
Guys, how do you fight the impulse to not text your ex months after a rough breakup?	female, (pronounced like tamale) came to r/AskMen from a comment about swamp balls. what helps me is keeping my ex's contact info, but renaming their contact. I'd recommend something simple, like "Don't"	Delete everything. She doesn’t want to hear from you and the only reason your doing this is because you are at a loose end. Also and I speak from experience if you do contact her and she doesn’t respond it will make you feel worse. Delete and move to pastures new.
Those not from the US, what are some big political or social issues going on in your country right now?	In Australia - postal survey going on to test whether Australians think gay people should be allowed to marry each other, or whether we continue to discriminate irrationally against them.	In Hong Kong: * Lots of tension regarding the upcoming handover of Hong Kong to China. Many Hong Kongers, especially the younger generation, want Hong Kong independence or true democracy for Hong Kong.
How the fuck do you whiten your teeth?	chemicals. people laugh at the british for yellowed teeth, and exaggerate it, but the uk has some of the best teeth on the planet, teeth are supposed to be off white or light yellow, your tooth enamel is white, and the dentine below is yellow.	Teeth aren't actually supposed to be really white and many whitening toothpastes aren't recommended by most dentists because most of them damage enamel over the years. Real white takes more than a toothpaste too because you have to actually change the enamel colour. That Hollywood smile is obtained by professional tooth bleaching.
Men who were beaten as a punishment as a child, how has it effected you growing up?	I don't hold grudges, it fucked me up in the short term but ultimately saved me from going down the wrong path. Makes me sad when I see kids acting out and knowing their parents will give in and reward them for being less cunty. Slap the little shits and if they cry, slap them again.	Grandfather was a sweet man. I was being a shithead once and he spanked my butt. One smack. I never gave him attitude again. There is a huge gap between spanking your child once and beating them till they're bruised.
How to have the awkward "I'm taking this girl home, so I'm ditching you bro" conversation?	1. There is no such thing as a bro code only stupid people believe in such a thing. 2. Just say hey I'm about to go home with her bye. Then leave.	"Hey bro gotta go get some pussy, here's $20 for the uber back" Literally no guy i know Would be mad
How did you change for better or worse when you got an SO?	Jesus. Before we were dating I was an unemployed alcoholic smoker. Now I'm employed, quit drinking two years ago, and quit vaping a few months ago.	More anxiety, depression, self consciousness, insecurity, less confident. Never thought I’d feel like this, ever. I used to be that confident charismatic go getter. I’m beaten down and need to get out. Edit: everyone you are too kind. Thank you for the support, it gives me hope. :)
What do people say is "no big deal", but isn't "no big deal"?	Using animals for food. It's super bad for our health. Not because we'll get fat, but because factory farms are breeding grounds for super-bacteria which are growing to be a very real threat. It's also an inefficient use of land, so we're destroying landscape and ground water. Methane release from cow-productions are a significant contribution to greenhouse gasses. On top of that, of course, all modern scalable facilities cause animals to suffer by any measure of suffering. Tbh I'm getting tired of getting the "no big deal" from meat-eaters at lunch or at dinner parties. Our culture has evolved on so many issues, and its time to evolve on this one too.	When you're late. It's no big deal the first time but if it happens consistently it's very annoying, especially if you don't give me a heads up that you're going to be late.
Fellow ugly men of reddit, how did you come to term with your ugliness?	Get a girlfriend/boyfriend that thinks you're cute/handsome. Every day she'll tell you you how cute and beautiful you are and eventually you'll believe that you are these things. Then it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks because your SO means everything to you and they are all that matters anymore.	basically stopped giving a shit about it. care about the people who do treat you like normal and i stopped trying to go after girls, maybe if a girl is one day interested in me ill attempt to have a relationship but im not going to go after it myself, although i dont recommend this to everyone cause i might just straight up not be as interested in a relationship as other people
Men who have dated someone from a different country, what was the biggest difference?	I dated a Romanian girl. She prioritized truth over political correctness. The Romanian government is corrupt and everyone knows it. But not like how lunatic social justice warriors call the US government corrupt--these are people who haven't experienced society in different parts of the world; they haven't faced reality. Not saying there aren't bad things about the USG, as there surely are, but let's not get too insane here like social justice warriors do. She could actually point out the good things and bad things in people instead of "all x are bad and all x are good. If you disagree with me, fuck you". Instead, she was capable of holding a rational argument and accepting truths from all sides. What are we going to do with all these crazy social justice warriors?	I'm Irish. I've had long term relationships with German ×2, Polish and Lithuania girls. The Eastern European girls are more traditional and the Germans like slightly weird sex. Other than that not much else, oh naturally they are better looking than Irish women.
How often do you text with a girl you're casually dating?	If you've been on 5 dates without anything physical she's probably not that into you. I never text a woman "for shits and giggles" because that's typically code for "provide something of value to me." Attraction typically doesn't work by the man asking the woman to provide value. I only text when I have something of value to provide.	I personally would like a guy I’m seeing to check in. If I’m seeing you I like you and enjoy talking to you. I usually text with the guy I’m dating daily and would be bothered if we didn’t talk all week. So depends on the girl and the relationship
What are your thoughts on the Harvey Weinstein controversy?	He's a piece of shit, but for every girl he sexually assaulted there's 10 who willingly sucked his dick in exchange for a movie part and knew exactly what they were doing and did it willingly. Some of those same women will come out and say it was non-consensual too. This shouldn't really be news for anyone, Hollywood is an incredibly promiscuous and vice filled industry that is overflowing with hypocrisy around every issue they pretend to champion. I'd be willing to bet that Weinstein isn't even the worst offender and more will be coming out. Also I'd be willing to bet that some sick kiddo pedophile shit will come out of this somehow, Weinstein or not.	I'm sad but not shocked. The casting couch thing in Hollywood isn't a new thing. Hopefully people who have been effected can find closure now.
Here’s a thought experiment: If you took sexuality out of the equation, how many of the women you’ve ever dated would you actually be friends with? Some? Most?	None. I have nothing in common with them. I don't solve my problems by crying until someone fixes them for me, I am not interested in things like baking or flower arranging, and it bores me to tears when someone wants to complain without even thinking of a solution never mind working towards one. I also really wouldn't be friends with people whose core idea about men are hostile and deep down want men to be hurt, any more than black folks would have Klansmen friends, etc. I'm exaggerating to make a point but still. Nothing wrong with any of the above, it's just not me and I can't really work with that.	Probably about half. At this point, I won't date anyone I couldn't see myself being friends with. Sex is great, but I'm weird enough that if we couldn't be friends, we're probably not compatible as anything more than fuck buddies.
Girls can now join Boy Scouts. What do you think about that?	Honestly, it’s a good thing. Girl Scouts as an organization has been lacking for decades compared to the BSA, and the more people involved the better, especially with different perspectives like women. Although it shouldn’t change too much, I don’t want it to slip into Girl Scouts 2.0 or whatever.	I mean, there is a thing already. It's called Venture Scouts. It was treated in my troop as a post-Eagle thing, and it was co-ed.
What thing you added to your morning schedule that helped you a lot?	An earlier bed time. "But," you may start, eagar to point out the flaw in my statement,"d3jake, you devilishly clever man, that's a decision made *before* your morning routine. Tis a silly mistake, and therefore out enjoy men." Here's why. I had low ambition to get out of bed earlier and get more accomplished before work. I made an effort to go to bed earlier, and found I had time and energy in the morning to make a decent breakfast, pack a good lunch, and get out the door early. It all tracked back to getting to bed earlier.	Making my bed. I won’t let myself leave my room in the morning without doing it. Then if everything goes to shit throughout the day, ill still have a nice already made bed to come lay in.
What do you think about Terry Crews coming out about his experience with sexual predators in Hollywood?	What I think is that between Weinstein, Faraci, and so many others like them turning out to be predators I'm wondering if the entire origin of "rape culture" is a real thing that exists in that elitist bubble that's been projected onto all of society.	Terry Crews is a stand up dude, I hope that his story motivates others to come forward. I have zero patience for predatory people.
What's the fastest time you've hooked up with someone you just met?	From meeting to sex in under 5 minutes. There was one that was like 30 seconds. I was in a bar she comes up unzips my pants and starts stroking me basically led me to the parking lot.	I had a decent looking girl come up to me at a party and asked me if I wanted to have sex with her because she just caught her boyfriend cheating. I obliged, and took her back to my place and fucked her. Woke up in the morning, fucked her again, cooked her breakfast and she left and I haven’t seen her since and still to this day only remember her first name and that she was sorta hot :P
What happened this week that made you really happy?	Every week makes me happy, I love what I do and I have time and money for hobbies. Life's short I think we should all try make the most of it	This time last week, I was snuggling up with my long distance girlfriend and her cat. I'd say that made me pretty happy.
Men of reddit, what mantras do you use to help you get through life?	If I kill her, I won’t be able to hide the body. If I kill her, I won’t be able to hide the body. If I kill her, I won’t be able to hide the body. If I kill her, I won’t be able to hide the body. If I kill her, I won’t be able to hide the body.	"Don't let your mistakes compound." - everyone fucks up. But man, if you fuck up, don't use the fuck up as an excuse to keep fucking up. Shit can unravel *real* fast. Take a breath, regroup, and come back strong.
What happened that made you realize life isn’t fair?	I'm 30 and never had sex, compared to some guys who have no problem finding it when they want it.	I know good people who died young, and I know pieces of shit that are in there 80's and still spreading misery.
Which myth(s) do you wish would die already?	Gun control will keep people safer. Chicago has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country. They also have one of the highest homicide rates in the country. Criminals do not pay attention to laws. They will get their hands on guns no matter what. Disarming law abiding citizens does not make everyone safer.	Defibrillators aren't magical life-restarting machines. They're quite literally almost *never* used correctly in TV and film. I know it's a great plot point, but I think it's giving a lot of people potentially dangerous ideas about what these things actually do. If a patient has flatlined, using a Defibrillator isn't going to do anything but mildly barbecue their corpse.
Men, what is the weirdest (or most unexpected, or most interesting) question a woman has asked you because something about men confused her? What was your answer?	"How can you be for equality and not call yourself a feminist?" Because I don't need labels to explain what I believe, I believe in treating everyone equally, with the same standards and same level of respect. What's not to get? :/	I knew a college girl (back when I was in college) and she was a virgin. I don’t remember how the conversation started, but a group of us were having drinks and the topic turned to sex. The virgin girl was asking a lot about penises and posed an interesting question. She asked if penises had bones in them. We all giggled a little bit, and I responded with “that’s why they call them boners”. It seemed as if a light was turned on and she finally understood. After a few minutes I broke the news to her that there are no bones in a male penis, and it’s more like a sock that holds blood. She seemed even more confused.
How do I tell my boyfriend that I'm losing attraction to him because of his beer belly?	It's up to you. Don't forget that your metabolism isn't always going to be what it is today. If you love him, stay. If it's a deal breaker, leave. My wife is 40 lbs more than she was when we met. I hang around 180, always have. She is as beatiful today as she was the day we met. Love the person, not the body. The body will change. We all age.	There's no easy way to do it, but at least take some comfort that the genders aren't reversed. There's a little less social stigma that way. You need to convey your feelings on the matter, so I suggest you be direct about it so that he gets that it isn't an idle wish but an actual impediment to a healthy relationship. Say what you say here, that it's difficult for you to imagine continuing a relationship with someone who doesn't prioritize their health and to whom you are losing attraction. Be direct, but not cruel. His reaction will tell you a lot about the future of things. I doubt he's unaware of the development, but sometimes a healthy intervention can start a turnaround. And sometimes it takes the risk of losing a good thing to get off your ass and stop being lazy.
How normal is it for a girl to NEVER initiate anything during dating? How do I get this girl to be proactive?	Bitch, she aint into you. Think about it like this. Let's say you were a really hot guy (ex. Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, etc.), do you not think she would be eager to text and initiate plans with you?!? She's not into you - move on.	ITT: The behaviour that she's showing is either clear evidence that she's into you or clear evidence that she isn't LOL
How did you mess up a relationship?	Being a pussy by not taking her out to dances, lying/cheating, being a dick, just things that made her stop liking me.	(Potential relationship) freaked out when she asked "how are you single?" Proceeded in demonstrating all my flaws in 2 days. Every. Single. One. A few days later, she stopped texting back.
How hard is wall sex?	Grown women are heavy. I mean at what age do you stop picking up your kids? Five, six? And then they don't even weigh half of a grown woman. Don't believe what you see in movies.	Less difficult than standing sex, more difficult than bed sex. The wall provides extra support so it's actually not too difficult to support her weight while going to town. I recommend if you're not strong enough to just outright pick her up, balance and put your dick in her while holding her, start while sitting on a couch or the edge of the bed with her on top and then pick her up and walk towards the wall.
How do I ask a guy out if I'm unsure of his sexuality?	> How would you feel most comfortable being approached like this? These is nothing that would make me comfortable about being approached in this setting. >Do I ask him if he's into guys? Please don't. Ask me about girls and see if I talk about girls. >Do I ask him out for a beer? Not with romantic intentions. Please don't. >f you knew a guy was into you but you're not like that would you feel comfortable being just good buddies after? No. It would be weird.	It's hard to say how he will react since different guys have different reactions to being hit on by a guy. First off, he should know you are gay. If he doesn't, find a way to let him know, and see how he reacts. You could also probe a bit to see what sort of people he is into by asking him what his "type" is/etc.
What's something you're ashamed to admit is attractive?	I like so many things. But very often when I say I like legs, boobs, butts, ears, hair, etc, I don't mean sexually. I really can appreciate a beautifull leg or butt without get aroused or think on sex. And I fell sad that I can't tell a women with a beautiful leg or butt that she has a awsome leg/butt, because sure she will call me pervert. Hard to appreciate beauty on women now a days.	I mean, not ashamed, but I'm hugely attracted to girls with tired eyes, like those permanent dark circles or slight bags that never go away. I honestly don't know what it is, but it is so damn attractive to me. Maybe it just gives the illusion of more depth...
Men of reddit, how was your high school experience like? Was it truly the best time of your life?	College= best time of your life. Unless you go to college in your "hometown". College helped me develop into the person I am. Once you leave the nest and expand your comfort zone, it really leads to amazing things some bad some good but overall amazing.	It was fine. The more I look back the more I realize how unimportant it was. Went through typical teenage depression and drama, had a handful of friends until they all went balls deep into the party life. But looking back as a 25 year old now... It wasn't the best time or worst time... Just a time. No need to feel empty due to it not being everything you wanted, because you still have like 60 years of life ahead of you. We're still young, OP. No need to long for the time when we were kids. Edit: though I'll admit, I am looking forward to a 10 year reunion, should we have one.
If you hit on a "girl" and then "she" politely told you "she" was a dude what do you think your reaction be?	I would apoligize. Trans women can be very attractive but I just can't get past the cock n'balls part. Granted, some people can and that's great but probably apologize as I don't mean to offend.	It would kill any romantic interest there. But not any friendly interests. It would provide a very interesting conversation topic.
Men of reddit, how the hell do you deal with your oily face?	I have three rules for myself to avoid acne: 1. Wash my face twice a day 2. Avoid sugar like the plague 3. Don't masturbate This triad works really well for me. If I break any of the three rules, I break out. It might seem hard, but it gets easier as you stick to it. Disclaimer: I have no clue why masturbating makes me break out... I just know it does. I'm not one of those die hard fapstronauts, I just like having clear skin. Anyway, maybe give those three things a try. Good luck! PS Long bangs are bad too	Are you using a moisturizer after you wash your face? Even with oily skin (sometimes **especially** with oily skin) you should be moisturizing every time you wash your face. Also an SPF sunscreen in the AM every day. /r/SkincareAddiction is a great resource.
Dad's of Reddit, what is the number one tip you can give to someone who just found out his wife is pregnant?	Remember. It's not "my wife is pregnant" it's "We are pregnant". It's a shared experience. There best part of this is that it works both funny and serious.	Great advice here, but on the more serious side of things, I know you’re excited, but don’t start telling people yet. Miscarriage is SUPER common (20% of pregnancies abort in the first trimester). No one takes about it ever, but it really fucking sucks, and it’s 10x worse when you have to “untell” everyone you told. People don’t know how to react, and it’s really painful and weird for everyone involved. Absolutely no announcements on Facebook yet, and honestly don’t tell anyone you wouldn’t be comfortable untelling. But now that that shitty lecture is over, congratulations! Really try to step up the housework and patience on your part, because your poor wife is about to be really sick and miserable for a couple months. And don’t take it personally when mood swings go nuts around week 8-9.
Men, how have you been self-destructive lately?	Was accused of sexual assault thirty years ago. Thought it was no big deal so I decided to get out in front of it and say I didn’t remember but I did some shit when drunk back then. Then thought it would be a good time to come out of the closet to deflect what little heat might come from an unfounded accusation. Wait. That’s Kevin Spacey. Not me. Sorry.	I have a paper due by the end of this week, and I continue to waste my time doing mundane shit like browse reddit, play games, tinker with my fantasy football teams, and watch youtube videos. I just can't seem to focus, and actively avoid doing the things I'm supposed to do, then I feel like shit afterward. I've been working on this paper all semester. And the previous semesters. Actually it's my Master's thesis.
What insult have you received that took you aback with how cutting but entirely accurate it was?	This was yelled at me by an angry driver, "Well...you're Asian." I mean, on the level? He's not wrong. I'm in fact Asian. The fact that he said it to be derogatory, just set me off. Having lived in So Cal all my life and grown up in an area with a high % of Asians, I had never experienced real racism till that moment. Thinking about still makes my heart rate go up.	"You need this relationship just as much as I do" I have been discussing breaking up with my SO, and I was telling them how i felt like a therapist to deal with their issues and how I felt the relationship was entirely one sided because I helped them with their life and problems but I wasn't getting anything out of it They astutely pointed out my life was really empty and I used supporting my SO to get a sense of purpose and an ego trip from being needed, and we were both equally responsible for the relationship becoming codependent Well, they were completely right. I ended up breaking things up and taking a few months to work on myself before getting into another relationship.
What are some good ways to casually see if a female friend is interested?	Ask her, via text, if she's into you or wants to make out. If she says anything but "Yes!" just say "oops that as my friend haha lol heh".	We went to an amusement park and a concert together on Sunday and had an incredible time. The feelings took me by surprise, caz I’ve always just seen her as a friend. We’re hanging out this weekend again so I’d like to see if she’s feeling the same way
What message/lesson from Romantic Comedies do you think men should explicitly ignore?	That a man’s life is less valuable than a woman’s. There is an argument to be made about children. When it comes to men and women it is just not true. For example when the Titanic sank men and women should have followed the children onto lifeboats. Romantic comedies often key in on this idea.	Basically all of them. Don't threaten suicide (the notebook) don't stand outside with a radio (was that say anything?), don't break up another great relationship (the ugly truth) don't follow her, stalk her and learn what she likes to get her attention (every romcom ever). Basically do not do anything romcom
What muscle do you have to put very little work into at the gym for it to come out looking great?	I don't do gym, but somehow my quads just got stronger and stronger hiking, climbing and backcountry skiing. Basically, lots of activities where you gain altitude through leg power. The problem is that it overpowers my hamstrings giving me pelvic tilt :/	Forearms. I do literally no work on them specifically, but they look great. My evidence is that I can hardly get anything done if I have my sleeves rolled up to the elbow when working around the house. Wife will jump me, guaraneteed.
Non-Americans, what is dating culture like in your country? How are relationships formed, and what are the bounds of physical intimacy inside and outside marriage?	From I know about US dating culture is kinda uptight. I am a 23M Brazilian and dating here is... Cool? I mean you can get a girl in the night and kiss or even have sex with her if lucky... Tinder has made all my relationships...and it is mandatory to kiss someone on first date. If you dont you wasted your time. Then for serious relationships it doesnt take too long, after 3 months of solid interactions is safe to say you are dating for real. It doesnt need to be someone you know before, anyone.	I have dated in England, America and in India. To put it in simple words, In America, it’s like “she’s my friend. I can’t date her and ruin the friendship”. In India, it’s like “we’re not even friends, how can we just date?” It kind of makes sense because in India people date thinking there’s a 90% chance it’s forever. And in America there are more chances of people thinking this might not be forever. So yeah you could ruin a friendship.
Students who developed good study habits later in life when they previously had bad habits or none at all, what did you do? Do you still have trouble or are worried you'll slip back?	Care about school. This means spending time on homework, going to office hours, and at least trying to pay attention in class. There really isn't much else. If you can't figure out "how" to study when there are trillions of resources out there to help you, you belong in trade school.	Learned study habits in law school. Basically, there's 2 steps: 1) sat myself in a chair and 2) didn't leave the chair until my work was done. In the beginning you waste a lot of time. But eventually you begin learning to do the work so that you can leave the damned chair. I now work remotely several days a week and this habit has been fantastic at helping me meet my billable work requirements.
What’s the furthest you’ve ever drunk teleported?	Yep! I was at a party and wanted food, 'teleportred' a full car (full of people) to Wendy's and I was ordering food. I then 'teleported' us all back to the living room to eat our food. Twas a wonderful venture.	30 meters from my house, 33km from where i blacked out. Looks like i tried to drunk-stumble home but ended up in the gutter by my neighbour's house. So close yet so far.
What was the most condescending piece of dating advice you've gotten from other guys?	"Treat women like shit, it's biological. They can't fight millenia of falling for alpha males." To his credit, he always has a girl friend. This one is on you ladies, if you're wondering why you always end up with assholes, stop dating assholes lol.	I used to be somewhat heavier than I am now. I still went out with women quite a bit, but it was mostly with women who were around my attractiveness level, i.e. girls who were a bit plump. One of my friends like to give me shit for dating fat chicks, nevermind the fact that his love life was limited to his right hand. If you haven't gotten laid in years you don't have "high standards" you're just shooting out of your league.
Would you rather your SO have a beautiful face or a sexy body? And why?	Body. Get her some expensive make up tutorials. That contour shit goes a long way. I'm friends with a girl who is a literal bridge troll but everyone thinks she's pretty because she's good at makeup. If she gets skilled enough she will start doing it different ways too and next thing you know your s/o looks like several different pretty girls	Face! Contrary to the saying "You don't look at the mantlepiece when you're stoking the fire." I like to look at the mantelpiece when I'm stoking the fire.
What do you admire most about your mom?	When I beat her for burning my chicken tendies, she usually does a better job for the next month or so. She's trainable.	She grew up in a small town where nobody went to college. She was abused growing up, so she married right after high school. He abused her too. She divorced him and went to college. Now she's a doctor and has been married to my awesome dad for 30 years. She is a symbol of where hard work can get you, and she's an awesome mother.
Men who have had a vasectomy, how did it improve, or destroy, your sex life?	Improved incredibly. Im 27 and about to bareback an 18 year old on this lazy Sunday with no worry of pregnancy. How can it get any better than that? Single, no kids, no wife, no worries. Life is perfect.	SO doesn't need to take hormonal birth control anymore and her sex drive has improved, which has made my sex drive improve, which has made me fill her up more frequently, which makes the two of us very happy.
Would you tell a girl why you're rejecting her if you reject her?	In person, probably wouldn't. In real life I'd probably just say "Thanks but I'm not interested." If she pressed me for an answer I might oblige. "Your boobs are too small" is an unlikely scenario in my case, but I could say something like "I'm not a fan of too much cellulite" or something like that.	Depends on the reason. If I'm not attracted physically I'll just say I'm not interested. If it's a personality issue I'd tell her we don't seem compatible.
What have you guys decided on as your purpose in life?	>*We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.* **TL;DR** To make sure that my country remains a place that my kind are able to live & grow as intended by those insightful men who came before me.	To enjoy it. It's strange how time and age changes your outlook. When I was younger 18-26 all I wanted was money and flashy things. Now I'm 37 I want to relax. Earn less money but with much less stress and enjoy my hobbies and Enjoy time with my wife and dogs.
When have you found out a friend wasn't actually the good guy/girl in their relationship stories after all?	Why would she tell you that? As a shut in, if I confided in someone something like that I'd be fucking devastated that they did that.	Guy I worked with constantly bitched about how insecure his wife was about their relationship. He worked late a LOT to support his wife and their two kids. She thought he was out with other women. He was later fired when he was caught in the supplies room with the office secretary.
Why is your ex-bestfriend your ex-bestfriend?	I joined the military, and he still sits around in his sister’s house smoking pot, working at Lowe’s, and dating a high schooler. I want nothing to do with that.	We just drifted, no bad blood but after a while we just stopped seeing and speaking to each other regularly.
If your wife was going away for the weekend, and you had the house to yourself for three days what would you do?	Nothing different, because my live-in-girlfriend doesn't control my fucking life. If your girlfriend or wife DOES control your life, you need to get your fucking balls back and remind her that relationships are two-way, not all about her.	Play video games and eat rubbish for 2 days. Then regret not tidying up after myself so on the final day panic tidy the house.
Tall dudes (&gt;6'0), what are advantages short dudes have that they don't realize?	I'm about the same size as you and I don't have any of the problems you're describing. Neither do any of my 6'-ish weightlifter friends. Though I don't do gymnastics. You need to buy better fitting clothes.	They fit in most modern cars without their heads being on the roof or having to practically lay down to see out the windshield.
How do you feel during intimate medical exams?	Personally, I hated being examined yearly. That last time, she was testing me there and I had a orgasm. I just felt extremely uncomfortable.	Yes - I'm sure there is some sort of law that states that "The more embarrassing the medical condition/procedure, the probability of encountering an attractive nurse who does the most awkward part of the diagnosis/procedure approaches 1" If it doesn't exist yet, it should and it will henceforth be known as /u/UghWhyDude's law of medical awkwardness.
What have you learned from AskMen this year?	A lot of you overthink how to talk to women. A lot of you overthink how to talk to people in general. It's not fucking hard, and the fact that you think it's hard to the point where you go into an online forum and ask for advice makes me question where the world will be in 20-40 years. Logically, this means a lot of you are anti-social loners, which is pretty sad but also makes me feel better about myself, considering I don't lack social skills with people and women.	That a lot of women really really want to ask that one guy out and absolutely would if only they had some balls. Truly, they try so hard despite their disability.
What’s the worst thing you’ve said to your SO in anger?	The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes. As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch. Among other things, we’re looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis, and we’ll be making constant adjustments to ensure that players have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via gameplay. We appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets. Our team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can.	My step dad called my mom a "plump little raisin"... she doesn't have any wrinkles and she's not even a little bit on the chubby side lmao.
What's the best way an SO has ever woken you up?	I was just barely awake and her first words to me were "I'm so horny, I want you so bad." Made her wait till I ate breakfast cause I can't do any of that on an empty stomach.	A gentle handjob until I was rock hard and just a little awake and then guiding me into her. Various partners have tried waking me up with head, but it never works out - all the moving around to get mouth to cock access always wakes me up.
In a romantic/flirtatious context, what was the most impressive/surprising thing a woman has done to you?	She fought me over a $140 check at a seafood place after she drove me, on our first date, to the city and walked along the river. I didn't give it up without a fight. Very shameful but I had two whole dollars so she did save my ass. One bill, one in my checking lol. I could have covered it, but it'd have been a pain with a family card and giving it back to the account.	Well, it's kind of boring compared to previously posted stories, but what the heck. I was leaving my uni with a lady-colleague of mine. As we walk out, we realise that it suddenly became incredibly cold and windy and she had neither jacket nor coat. I took off my jacket and gave it to her. When we came to the subway, she took it off and thanked me. I wanted to take it back, but instead she walked around me and put it on my shoulders. This little gesture... Nobody has ever done that to me. Not even my ex. To this day, the memory of this act of kindness warms my heart.
Dual-income no kids: what’s life like for you?	Single-income two kids isn't all that bad either. Life is good when you live within your means, no matter what your situation.	We both have good careers. Our only debt is her car however we're renting the house. We can stay out late or make last minute plans whenever we want. We take a short vacation every 2 or 3 months. It does feel kind of odd now that most of our peers have children. Sometimes I forget that my friends can't always close out the bar anymore.
Men with highly fetishized/objectified jobs (ie. doctor, high-powered lawyer, etc), how is dating going for you? What are the unique pros and cons?	I love enginners. They're smart, funny, witty, my god every engineer I've met I'm like okay can I date you?	I'm an engineer and I've never felt fetishized. maybe it's a grass is greener thing? regardless, dating is frustrating simply because so few women are interested in the things I care about. the fact that "how does that work?" is answered so universally with "I don't care" is just disheartening. also knowing that the *overwhelming* majority of people in my profession or those like are men makes me idly wonder if I wouldn't be better off gay.
Fellow dudes of AskMen, when was the last time you received a compliment on your appearance that you did not fish for? How common are compliments about your appearance, fished or otherwise?	> Fellow dudes of AskMen, when was the last time you received a compliment on your appearance that you did not fish for? Not counting girlfriend compliments: Last Thursday, from a business associate. > How common are compliments about your appearance? Much more common than Reddit or AskMen would have you believe.	I get compliments about my hair all the time...... mostly from elderly women, never girls my age (I'm 22). I never fish for compliments, as I'm very self-deprecating.
Men, what’s the WORST thing a girl has said while having sex?	Daddy Yeah, unless you’re my kid or addressing me to my kid, stop that shit. It’s disgusting and not attractive at all.	As im slipping it in, her- “wait, you washed it since you pooped last,right?” , me- “what? Yes”, her- “but with antibacterial soap, right?”, me -“um, what... yeah sure”, her -“i dont believe you. Go wash in now and i need to smell it first. “
Men who look forward to starting the work day, what do you do?	I'm an entrepreneur. I do whatever I want to do. As long as I'm able to hook it up to a business model.	I work in a brewery/taproom. I work with a great crew, so it feels like I'm getting paid to shoot the shit with my buddies.
What was your worst experience meeting your girlfriend's family?	One of my exes and were both bisexual and her parents were thrilled because there are some horror stories about some types of straight men. Well, she had a psychotic younger sister who wasn't pretty and it's obvious. Well, she was "going to expose his secret gay affair". She'd make a point to have one or more with these rude gay guys with her. One day, I just said, "those nonsense theories won't help you blame my existence for you being single. If your own men don't want you, don't be blaming us." BOOM. I would catch her scurry past a few times. She's brought up bi men in situations with friends. "The 'official story' is that women don't want them but it's a sham! You've gotta be a lesbo for them to think you are hot too."	Her family made Chinese food in an attempt to help me feel at home when I had dinner with them the first time. It was a really sweet gesture, but it was rather misguided. Apparently I was the first Asian guy their daughter had ever brought home, so they didn't know how to host me. I actually find the experience really amusing; my girlfriend at the time was mortified.
Men who never had a relationship until a "late" age, what do you wish you knew?	That actually seems to be the norm these days. I'll throw out some things I think might help. * Don't freak out about period stuff, whether it's over a pad/tampon or waking up in a pool of their blood. * They're going to steal some of your clothes. * Women 'logic' is different from men logic. It's frustrating but it won't ever change. * Don't go grabbing at their tits all the time, I know they're awesome but restrain yourself. * Even though they're going to get stupid from hormones every so often *never say it's just their hormones* even though it is. * learn to cook, modern women usually suck at it. If you want to eat good food you're going to have to make it yourself. * use protection	First serious relationship happened around your age, OP. I wish I knew then that a little bit of openness with your feelings and risk-taking can go a long way. I thought that fear functioned as a way to protect yourself from harm or rejection, but sometimes it keeps you from living your best life.
What’s a good thing about yourself you keep secret, and why?	I can read people, like, the little things when in a conversation, those are the ones that matter. It's one of the personality traits of the entrepreneur ESTP-A / ESTP-T. Sensing in a conversation. So, I'm very open, I can talk very easily, to anyone. And for example my teammates know about this. However, my ability to be sensing in a conversation, I like keeping that to myself.	I'm faster at work than I let on. I keep that secret because hard workers only get worked harder and I don't feed my kids with "At a boys"
Guys, when was the moment you finally realized that you no longer give a fuck anymore and how did that realization affect you moving forward?	I stopped giving a shit in highschool. But idk lately I think I’ve started to give a shit again cause I’ve met someone. Kinda sucks but whatever I guess	After my last relationship ended badly, I realized that I cared way to much about what other people think and I try to please everyone else before my self. I literally remember sitting in my room and saying " why do i give a fuck? " It was at that point that I realized, I shouldnt. I should live life for me and make my self happy regardless of what others think. It worked out pretty well, I own a house have a better job with a much better schedule, working on starting my own business and me and my beautiful fiance get married next November :)
If you accidentally didn't sleep because you were too caught up playing Stardew Valley, how would you get through a day of work staring at spreadsheets all day?	> Cause I am fucked up right now. If you're staying up all night playing a simulated farm game on a work night, you have more issues than a lack of sleep lmao	Are you me? I read this advise on Reddit a long time ago: find a conference room and a box of paperclips. Throw the paperclips on the floor, close the door, and sleep with your feet up against the door. If someone opens the door, it will bump your feet and wake you up and you can pretend to be picking up the paperclips.
What is the aspect of a breakup that sucks the most to you ?	So the longest iv ever been with someone is 3 months, and this may come off as shallow or me having a pretty low self esteem. But the part that sucks the most for me is feeling like they'll be able to bounce back and get someone new to date waaaaay faster than me. If im lucky I can find someone new maybe a year later if im really lucky like 6 months. So I cant really date around looking for a good SO well atleast based on my dating history. So getting dumped or having to move on, I feel like well easy for you, you can find someone new so much quicker than me. tldr: Im shallow with low self esteem	The part that sucks worst: You just went through something horrible, and you can't talk it out with the person you're used to leaning on the most.
Guys who watch camgirls, what is the point?	There a cam girl that looks just like an ex. I mean everything, except that the cam girls hair is lighter than my ex.	I have a close friend who gets paid to do cam shows. From what I've seen, about everyone who has offered to pay for a show is someone that's obviously too shy or awkward irl to get any female interaction. It seems like they fill that void by paying a chick online to treat them nicely and be attracted to them. One of the viewers even started calling the shows "dates", so you can imagine the much bigger problems these dudes have.
When were you most an asshole to someone you've dated?	My current relationship, I treat her quite rough especially sexually. I pretty much force myself on her pretty much everyday to the point where we only have sex when I want it, I regularly ignore her needs both sexually and physically. We also have the same type of sex in the same position every single day, I find it pretty boring and I don't know if she likes or not mainly because she doesn't talk to me at all for some reason even though we've been together for years. Idk why, sometimes I feel as this could be a result of my mistreatment as I can be quite abusive at times, but in the end I feel this connection to her, not just emotional but also physical and I am proud to call her my left hand.	i feel pretty bad about my second gf. i just up and dumped her one day because i wasn't attracted anymore and didn't see it going anywhere. thing is, i never told her why. i just asked her to meet up and she was crying. i bought her a drink and some food, hugged her, said sorry and left. she was so into me. and i just wasn't. could have did that better.
What does your seemingly normal SO do that makes you wonder if they might actually be a complete idiot and you’ve been duped?	I had an ex who was a veterinarian. She and one of colleagues got into all that quackery when overnight everyone suddenly became gluten and lactose intolerant. She had some allergy test done, which said she was "allergic to dairy products". Bearing in mind she'd grown up on a dairy farm and was a veterinarian, it took wayyy too long to convince her that eggs are not dairy products... All I wanted was a fry-up for breakfast. We went out for lunch.	To flip this slightly, my wife watched me wrap a couple presents this weekend and asked if I was having a stroke
How do I convince myself I'm good enough for a SO?	Listen to that voice and work on urself. If that voice is saying ur ugly then go to the gym. If that voice Is saying ur poor then make more money. Etc etc...	What works for me is realizing that the girl I'm dating isn't some undesirable piece of trash. If she didn't feel like I was worth spending time with rather than her hanging out with friends, meeting new guys or whatever it is, then she wouldn't. That means the things she deems important in a partner are present in me so no matter what I think of my qualities, she sees them differently.
Men of Reddit, what are the best things an attractive girl can do to earn more respect/be taken more seriously in the workplace?	Do your peers and boss feel you are as competent as they are? You should ask them and not just assume. 90% of people think they are above average.	> a guy in the meeting makes a similar suggestion (sometimes, the exact same suggestion) Can you make some of those suggestions in writing instead?
Men of Reddit. How many of you have never had a one night stand, and is that a result of choice or inability?	Every single person who replies here is going to say by choice, but we all know it’s due to inability.	Never. Inability I suppose, but it's more accurate to say it's just not in my nature. I'm more of an introvert, so the idea of going out to a bar and striking up a conversation with a stranger is pretty foreign to me. And even if I did, I'm not sure I have to social prowess to pull that off.
Tired of being a Nice Guy. What does it take to be a Good Guy?	In retrospect, I think that the nice guy problems that I had could have been largely prevented by not trying to make female friends. That just set me up for the problems described in Ladder Theory. Guys are for friends. Women are for dating. Keep the boundaries clear. If I fall for a female friend, I'm almost inevitably friendzoning myself. Also: be you. Maybe that's being a nice guy--polite, kind, and respectful. Embrace who you are and accept that a whole lot of women will have zero interest in you but prefer men that you regard as jerks or otherwise your social inferiors. Be who you are and let other people--including women that you find attractive--be who they are. Don't concern yourself with the values of other people, let alone get upset about them.	> I joined r/niceguys to try and identify nice guy behavior in myself and cure it if I can **but no one really gives advice on what to do, just what not to do.** Let me reveal the truth to you then, young grasshopper. What you must do, without fail, is to find self-love and self-confidence. To find self-love, you must find yourself believably attractive. To find yourself believably attractive, you must have positive, interesting qualities. To have positive, interesting qualities, you must have genuine interests and emotions that do not gravitate around yourself and your resentment. To have interests and emotions that do not gravitate around resentment, you must learn not to blame others for your failures. To not blame others for your failures, you must learn to appreciate errors. At that point, the young student attained great enlightenment.
What's the worst thing you've ever said to someone who had a one-sided crush on you?	Something along the lines of "I hope you die of cancer" while cuddling on a bench in a park. Yeah I am mostly just sharing this story because it sounds really weird I guess.	Nothing. Not saying anything hurts the most, as it leaves said person in a state of confusion. Plus, it wastes both your and that persons' time.
How often do you take sick days just because you need a break?	I don't think I've taken a sick day in ~5 years. Even if i had a day where I didn't show up at my corporate job(I'm salaried, hours are irrelevant) I still did work, and I own a bar, co own a theatre and own multiple rental properties. I'll have days where I don't go many places, but I'm still always working. I'm pretty much too busy to even be sick, let alone "need a break"	I am a manager for a team of 28 and our performance review season just ended. Mental health days are absolutely a tolerated and understood thing at the company I work for and HR instructions for managers are to look out for them as an early sign of work related burnout. It works for now, but it's one of those things where it takes a small amount of abuse to spoil it for everyone and I dread that coming. As to myself, I think I take one about once every 3-4 months. A lot of the time, they are not really fully mental health days, but are combined. I'd feel under the weather for some reason, but not sick enough to call in sick by itself. Exhaustion and/or stress would make me decide to call in sick instead, when normally I'd just tough it out that day.
What are subtle red flags at a job interview that verbalize, "Working here would suck"?	Show up when people are arrive for work if you can. Look at the faces of the people as they are walking into work. If most of them look unhappy chances are you'll be unhappy there also.	I interviewed at a place that said more than 5 call outs in a year meant termination and that I shouldn't expect to take any vacation days in the first year. I'd say that sounds pretty shitty. Also find out why they need you to work there. What happened to the last guy? Is there high turnover? If you can lowkey talk to anyone that works there, do it. They'll tell you what's up.
How often have you been surprised by what some girls find attractive?	ITT people believing there is a thing that "girls find attractive". I'm pretty sure there isn't a single person on the planet found attractive by more than 30% of "girls", not even the most popular supermodel.	Many times. Like Rachel? She said no to Batman. And look what happened. Not only did she get blown up by a clown, but the guy that she went for had half his face blown off.
What are the signs you look for in your own life to indicate that you're ready for a new relationship?	I'd say a big sign would be an general non-interest in getting in another relationship. That is to say, you're not actively looking for one, don't necessarily want to, and are happy being on your own.	* when you can enter a new relationship without prior experience poisoning you (I.e.: you're not ready if you go into it being paranoid about cheating because your ex cheated). * When you are sufficiently confident in yourself that you're ready to ask yourself if you like her as opposed to only worrying about her liking you. * When you aren't hoping a relationship is going to fix all your problems and resolve unhappiness you really should be working on.
What annoys you most about porn?	They are trying to get ppl watching tranny porn because they have a bunch of ads for it on pornhub and such they know ppl get desentizedd and want them to walk into hardcore shit that ppl wouldn't normally watch or lke if they didn't get their brains all screwed up	The camera changes so frequently that if you see a scene that's hot, you have to keep playing that five seconds over and over again because camera dude just has to find a different shot constantly.
What are some of the fetishes women you have dated have had?	Slapping her face during foreplay. No. Couldn't do it. Liked calling me daddy. And saying "fuck your little girl". Always hot. She also liked fucking me while wearing one of her fur coats. Wasp. Another loved getting spanked and getting the back her neck bitten while getting fucked from behind. Anal stuff. Hair pulling. Half filipina/half Indian. Another loved anal. Loved blowing me in public places. Filthy talk. Wasp. Another likes to spit on my cock when she's blowing me. Loves getting her face soaked in cum. Tells me to spit on her pussy when I'm going down on her. Spanking. Hair pulling. Squirting. Latina. I don't even consider a lot of these things fetishes really. They're common preferences.	An ex had a fuck-a-total-stranger fetish that didn't mesh well with a monogamous relationship. My wife likes it when I give her firm, but courteous requests. It's very specific. Brutish dominant bossing around doesn't do it for her. And certainly not "Honey, would you pleeeease..." The perfect note to hit is polite and gentlemanly with my words, but with a tone that expresses my relaxed, utter confidence that she will do what I ask. It's the courteous manners of a man who is in control and knows it, but puts his commands in the form of gracious, even sweet requests, not because he has to, but because *that's how he likes things to be.* It's a sweet gentlemanliness, with a subdued confident assertiveness that's so subtle that strangers wouldn't notice it.
Men who are in their 30s, what advice will you give men in their 20s before they turn 30?	31 here. Alcohol is a waste of money. When I think about the number of cars, investment opportunities, and vacations I drank away it makes me want a drink. Alcohol is a drug. If you're serious about doing drugs then do them hard and get yourself out of the way of the rest of society. For the rest of us, don't drink. It serves no good purpose and it makes you grow titties. You don't need titties that bad.	Create a routine to stay in shape, you dont have to be on the cover of mens health but start a routine now, weight is harder to knock off when you get older. This will also help with confidence and your over all health. Tomorrow is never promised
Guys who have been lifting consistently for a long time, what does your diet look like on a day-to-day basis?	After morning workout: whey protein mixed in milk/soymilk Before leaving for work: protein smoothie (consisting of banana, yogurt, a little egg white, cereal, milk/soymilk, peanut butter, and almonds/walnuts) Lunch: 1-2 chicken breasts + brown rice with veggies; gulp it down with a bit of fruit juice Dinner: 1-2 chicken breasts + brown rice with veggies; with this I have a green smoothie (consisting of banana, carrots, broccoli, celery, red lettuce, and a bit of fruit juice). Before sleep: some cottage cheese (I don't always have this though)	Shitty mostly. The lifting I can do, the diet I suck at. I generally bake chicken, cut up some broccoli and carrots and mix it with rice with some teriyaki sauce. Pretty good stuff. Breakfast is typically oatmeal with some cinnamon and brown sugar. Then dinner usually varies. Last week it was pesto chicken with veggies. Sounds healthy. But last night I also ate cookies that my wife bought. I drink too much soda (soda has got to be my worst offence). I often eat frozen pizzas on weekends. Overall I eat well enough to maintain my weight but have a hard time cutting.
Men on OkCupid, does it suck for you as much as it does for me? Also, if you could invent a better app, what would be different about it?	Yeah, I'm really starting to dislike it more and more. The huge issue that pops up to me is that I'll start kinda seeing someone, and ditch all OKQ activity for a week or two, while we're texting. Then when the puppy-dog hangout phase ends and something on there gives me a notification, I'll get on there and see that she's on there and I get a sinking feeling in my gut. I really hate the "Online now!" feature, it's great for seeing who's not around anymore (and not worth messaging), but it makes me feel like shit when I see the girl I'm interested in is shopping around for better options.	I've had a fair amount of success on Tinder. It really pays to know your demographic and have a targeted, even polarizing profile with pictures that convey who you are and not just what you look like. If motorcycles are a big part of your life, have a great picture taken with you riding your bike. If you are happiest dancing, have a picture of that.
Girls pretending to be interested in me for fun - how to prevent being a target?	It was not about you. It only became about you when you made it about you. When girls are in a group it is about the social hierarchy in the group. The girl brought you over to prove here value and dominance over the group. That was your function, to look and act like a prize. Be social, be gentlemanly, be flirtatious but polite. 'Not now, maybe later' would have been a good line for you. You be the one to make them wait and guess. You ruined your chances with all the women there. It's not about you. Quit assuming it is.	I have questions: where do they take you when they say come with us? What happens when you’re there? I just want to make sure that it *is* some weird game that you described and you’re not misinterpreting the situation and they’re actually in to you. If you’re correct and they are just fucking with you, if you’re in a scenario where something like this could take place, indifference is your best friend. Say something like “oh that’s flattering but I’m talking with X here, tell her to come join us” and stay put. If their “friend” really is interested, they’ll come up to you and that’s when you can make your move. I’m not saying don’t ever make yourself vulnerable but in social situations where humiliating you is possibly the goal, don’t play their game.
What is a video you once saw but have never been able to find again?	Not a video but there was this gif of master chief kicking ass with a sign post and shotgun in the style of the matrix but alas i cant find it.	Saddam Hussein’s execution. Was all over the web for a few weeks, then just disappeared. Edit- before anyone says it, yes there is still a video out there, but it’s not the same source, which was much higher quality.
Men, how do you plan to care for your aging parents and in-laws, particularly elders who have failed to adequately save for retirement?	Just let 'em pass. Not your problem, you will have your own kids to worry about. Also if they're overweight, just let them die. Overweight people are generally more stupid and don't contribute much to society.	If they haven't saved, you're going to have to choose between the crap-tier care Medicare offers and bankrupting yourself. Try to get assets passed off ahead of time so that when they're applying for medicare they look as poor as possible.
What trait (physical or otherwise) does your SO possess that you previously found unattractive?	I don’t have a SO (yet) (hope to God) but I used to have a thing for big tits, ass, and tight clothes. Now, I don’t really care for it. All I want is a nice girl who likes and I like her.	Personality: I thought jealousy was an unattractive trait; in her it drives me crazy in the positive sense - all the way up to sexually arousing me. Physically: I never thought feet in general could be attractive, would have placed them between neutral and mildly gross, but her cute reactions when having them tickled made me like them.
How pathetic is it for a 20 year old man to cry because of his mom?	Your mom is a piece of shit human being and her existence brings down humanity as a whole, even if only by a little bit. She needs to be signed up as an organ donor than put down.	No. Crying and admitting emotion does not make you any less of a man and will definitely help you grow going forward.
What kind of condoms should a woman buy just in case of a hook-up?	You might need to buy multiple kinds. As you know not every dick is the same size. I can ONLY buy magnums. All other types actually cause severe pain.	As long as you're not buying condoms that are specifically for either big or small dicks, they should be fine for the majority of men. If a dude has a huge dick and doesn't bring enough with him, then that sucks for him.
Men who lost sexual desire for their partner then gained it back, what happened?	Hey may also just be asexual. I know in all the relationships I've had I feigned enjoying sex early on because I had the mindset that I'm a guy, I have to want sex, that's how it is. But I can't keep doing that and it eventually comes out, could be the case here as well.	I wanted to just post "Alcohol" from the title but your post deserves more Sneaking about is fun until it isn't Parents in the house can be a real passion killer. Same with kids, just because they are there. Why don't you book a hotel room for the night, i used to do this where there was a pub (aka bar) next to it. Few drinks, back to the room and voila! The reason for the bar was so it wasn't just a go here, have sex, go home as that could create pressure. A night away from normality usually works wonders.
Those of you who dated or had sex with someone of a different race or culture, what is your funniest/weirdest story of culture clash, and what race(s) are you both?	iv been with a first gen Sudanese girl and a first gen Kenyan lady and they were both pretty americanized but they were shocked with what i was packing for only being 5'7 tall.	She was black and I'm not. Rural southern Georgia, 30 years ago. Any time we were in public was an adventure.
What should every man experience by the time he is 30?	* Having sex with a married woman * Moving somewhere with no safety net, no one to bail you out if you don't make that place home * Getting shot and surviving * Challenging the way things are at a job you could afford to lose, especially if you challenging that thing makes the company more efficient. * Live in a loft in a nice city, and throw a big party when you move out. * Travel cross country on a rode trip, or a greyhound (once is enough if you choose the greyhound route) * Travel alone, and don't plan anything before hand I'm sure I have more but these are just things from personal experience that will change and shape you, hopefully you learn the right lessons from all of them.	Travel alone once. It can seem daunting and lonely, but my solo trip to Thailand was so amazing. Even traveling with 1 other person, you have to take in account what they want to do, what they want to eat, but alone? You do whatever the fuck you want. Wanna stuff your face with local cuisine and then get a massage and pass the fuck out? Do it. Someone tells you about this cool island with little monkeys and crazy night parties? Go. Nothing holds you back except yourself. Also, meeting people at Hostels is so much fun, I never really felt lonely.
Asian men, what are your thoughts on the stereotypes and portrayal of Asian men in the media?	I'm Polish, so I am about as qualified to be culturally-sensitive about this subject as I am to fly a space shuttle, but whatevs: I honestly don't think they have it that bad. Sure there's not a lot of them and they're rarely the protagonists, but when I think "Asian guy in a movie" what comes to mind is "competent, stoic, honuorable, humble badass". Though I probably should disclose that I watch more Asian movies than dumb American comedies.	It's pretty shitty, but I'm hardly surprised. We're a huge minority in the west, so I wouldn't really expect media to cater to us, but it doesn't help us when Asian men are usually portrayed as some combination of small, quiet, shy, nerdy, bookish, small-penised, sidekick, foreign, and effeminate. It certainly affects how people view us when these stereotypes are perpetuated in the media we consume. As a population, we're typically neutered in media; how often do you see an Asian male character get laid in movies that isn't some kind of joke a la Sixteen Candles?
For you married guys out there, did you, and when did you, stop fantasizing about your wife? Has sex changed for you?	I've always had fantasies about other women, even in the early dating years. Been married 10 years, 2 kids and wife still looks really good, have sex probably twice a week (would be more if work schedules permitted) ... I still want to fuck my wife, but I'd also like to mess around with some of the hot neighbor wives, the cute nurses at work, the hot moms at my kids events. Maybe I just lack the morals like some of you, but my dick is hard to satisfy.	So I have been with the same woman since 1972, I was in emotional love and physical lust when we got together and we basically stayed there till we got pregnant. Our sex life came back as having the baby became routine, same for baby two and three. As we got older we had dry spells sexually. We would switch to emotional love making, a lot of talking and cuddling and taking time for diner just us. Sex would come back and we would go back that direction for a while. My wife eventually had a medical issue and went through the change, things went back and forth again. I had my hips replaced and things swung again. If you just learn early to love unconditionally minor bumps like this mean nothing.
When is the last time you had to put your foot down with your SO?	if I put my foot down with my SO, it *will* be the last time. no, but seriously, for all the arguments we go through, I am very lucky to have someone who is willing to listen to a rational viewpoint. I cannot recall a single instance where either of us have been inflexible enough to put our respective feet down.	We just bought a house so there's a lot of decisions where one of the other is putting their foot down. We have disposable income but I had to put my foot down for a spending freeze because she's going crazy buying stuff for the house, some of it is stuff* we need but most of it is just stuff we want. We've already spent several thousand dollars on things we didn't need to and pushed aside things we probably should have spent that money on instead. So I said money freeze, she didn't like it but also didn't disagree.
Men who found love after giving up on the idea of ever finding someone, what's your story?	My story is that I don't love any one person. Last girlfriend was almost 10 years ago. I've been casually dating since then. If I get bored or a girl does something disrespectful I cut her out of my life. To me, there are more important things in life than pussy. "Bitches come and go" - J Cole	I'm a pretty ugly guy and also messed up my body further by being obese through puberty. Being bullied in school and seeing my parents destroy themselves in their unhappy marriage probably didn't help either. By my mid-twenties I had exhausted all possible venues for improving my attractiveness - I was at my best and my best was objectively unattractive. So I gave up and started just focusing on enjoy life and avoiding being depressed about loneliness - it didn't always work and sometimes I would get bouts of crippling sadness several days long. And then a little over a year ago I met someone through a friend. We had a lot of common interests and views, which was normal enough, but then it turned out she also finds me very attractive. So, I lost my virginity to her at 32 years old. We've been happily together ever since.
Wealthy single men, how do you date knowing there's a possibility the girl you're seeing may only be after you for your money and nothing else?	If I make considerably more than a girl, there’s no way it’s moving beyond casual fling/hookup. Also I generally don’t pay for a girls drinks or dinner on a date. That way I know she’s hanging around because she enjoys spending time with/fucking me.	My buddy makes six figures in his early 20s in the entertainment industry in LA. He has insane connections and women hanging all over him when they find out what he does. Whenever we go out together he tells people he works at Starbucks.
How would you deal with a girlfriend's intrusive male friend?	I live my life by a simple rule, at least when it comes to things like this: If I've asked you to stop doing something three time and you keep doing it, I'm going to hit you hard enough that you stop doing it.	There's a good chance he's into your girlfriend. When I got engaged to my now-wife, one of her guy friends that very obviously harbored a long-time crush on her tried to convince her to postpone the wedding. In my case it was just kind of hilarious/sad, but in this case it seems to be fucking with your psyche a bit. Definitely worth a conversation with her, just keep your tone very non-accusatory and tell her how you feel.
How often do you feel ugly/unattractive?	How does it feel knowing I was lucky generically to be born as one of the few 5% attractive guys in the world who can get any attractive woman? Literally nothing you can do school, work, career, etc will help you get laid more than me simply because I was lucky to hit the genetic lottery? Every time you see a gorgeous girl and desperately think to yourself "I wish she'd give me a chance" I want you to remember that assholes like me fuck her without even earning it or even trying. So enjoy your internet upvotes and DnD but in the real world where it matters you ain't shit. Hey but at least you got upvotes right? The bitches loves guys who get upvotes lol loser.	Every time I look at a picture of myself. It's like, *that's* what I look like?! Ew. I'm decent-looking when I look in the mirror, and people say I'm decent-looking in real life, but I always think pictures of me look terrible.
What acts of affection from your significant other are your favorite?	Random acts of BJ's. They're at their best when you don't have to ask and it's enthusiastic. Nothing compares. Always slightly less than you want, like if you want one a day, getting a free one 4 to 5x a week beats asking every day.	I tell my wife not to make my coffee, she doesn't drink coffee so logically it shouldn't be her responsibility. She does it anyway.
So I was invited to a party by this girl I’m involved with, but she also invited another man I know she’s talking to. Anyone ever been in a situation like this and if so, what did you guys do?	Didn't even read past the title. How cucked do you have to be to even consider attending as 1/2 of a dual male attachment to a female's attention prosthesis. But, you will go, because you like it, and you are a cuck. Enjoy	She's basically keeping you on the back burner in case things don't work out for her with someone else, in this particular case the other guy. She probably does value your friendship, but I'd drop any expectation that y'all will ever be a thing. Start getting out there and seeing other women. When she tries to get possessive tell her that you're single and she needs to back off, or cut her out. If the "party" would just be the four of you I wouldn't bother, unless her friend is cute and single.
How risky is it to ask a close female friend on a date? And if you ever did so, what was the outcome?	There's no such thing as a "close female friend" unless she's your cousin. Go for it if she's datable OP.	It's difficult to know the exact level of risk, but there's three main options. 1. she says yes and you see where that goes. 2. she says no, things may be awkward for a bit, but friendship endures. 3. she freaks out and your friendship ends either immediately or after not very much time has passed. Of course, after that three-pronged fork, there's other ways things can end, such as if she says no but things were going fine until she meets someone she does want to date and you can't handle it and have to distance yourself from her or cut off contact.
What is it like moving to a completely new city alone?	Hey man! I just moved to Vienna alone. Expect your friends to act like they care but as soon as you are away they won't give a shit bout how you are doing. But after a long cry alone, you'll be fine. Gives you a lot of opportunities, and hey what else is life for? Sometimes you need to be alone to find yourself and do what you always wanna had done. Don't be afraid, be yourself! You have the bravery to make that move, that alone should tell you you are special. Go on and imagine all the good things that may happen. What would it help to stay where you are?	It sounds awesome at first because of the thrill of moving to a new city. Then it sucks for a while because you realize you don't have any close friends and the closest people you have are thousands of miles away. You cry and spend time alone in your apartment. You realize you can't do this forever. It slowly starts to get better as you start making new friends and putting yourself out there in the new city. TL;DR: It's awesome at first. Then it sucks for a while. It gets better though. Source: moved from San Francisco to Chicago.
How would you approach someone who is "too attractive"?	>Is it possible for someone to be too attractive/hot/beautiful to be hit on or talked to? Yes. >If so, how would you approach someone like that? I wouldn't.	I tell myself daily that I may not be getting hit on because possibly I'm too attractive that I'm intimidating.... That must be it. Right?!?
Why is lol an acceptable form of punctuation?	People say it means nothing but it does tend to be used more by idiots and I judge them accordingly.	"I've told you like 5 times. next time don't be so stubborn lol" "I've told you like 5 times. Next time don't be so stubborn." Without the lol at the end you'd think I was mad or upset.
Men who dress well on a reasonable budget, what’s your strategy?	> reasonable budget If you make 250k a year, "reasonable" is very different than if you make 25k a year.	Dude...depending on where you live, hit up the outlet stores...or stores like Marshall’s, Ross, Winners, etc. A lot of brand name stuff at very good prices. My college roommate used to have to the nicest shit. Found out he would hit the thrift store...and apparently they even have brand new stuff that people donate and never wore. Which makes complete sense, because I would donate things I bought and never wore after it was in my closet for a long time. Impulse buys.... You got options.
What is the darkest, most terrible joke you know?	What’s the hardest part about having sex with a 6 year old? Getting the blood off of your clown suit.	I saw a black guy riding a bike this morning so I went to the garage to check it wasn’t mine and there it was still chained up, but asking for food.
What do you do when your S.O. tries to police your "likes" on social media?	Get a new S.O? Nobody tells me what to do. NOBODY. ANy man that allows his SO to police him like that is lacking a penis.	> break up with her /r/AskMen advice in a nutshell A slightly more optimistic approach: Don't play this game. Never get into arguments why or why not she you liked something, because her policing is an expression of her immaturity and/or insecurity. Instead, try to find the root cause (WHY is she so insecure about it) and work on that and make her feel secure. Try to tell her that you feel it's an invasion of your privacy. If that doesn't work, well, might have to actually let her go. The above only applies if you're not actually going through exes or random hot girls profiles and just like everything. In that case stop doing that, that would weird most people out too.
Losing my libido, girlfriend taking it personally, what do?	See a doctor. You might be suffering from clinical depression or maybe just ED. Edit: yeah, sure. This comment telling someone experiencing sudden onset symptoms is somehow controversial. Guys. When anything rapidly and negatively changes in you, you should seek a doctor.	Stopping in to suggest maybe it's the time of year? If you're in a place that's not warm, you can be low on vitamin D. (Pun not intended). Lots of people are Vitamin D deficient in the winter. Low Vitamin D could cause low testosterone. Might be worth looking into because most people that are deficient don't know it. Could also explain why you're tired. Or it could just be normal fatigue.
Why aren’t we taught self worth as compared to the opposite sex?	I would rather have this problem than women's I'M A GODDESS self delusion. We start low and work ourselves up. Worst that happens is you stop progressing. They start with a wholly incorrect self delusion and reality slowly turns the screws on them. Can you imagine starting with an ego the size of most movie stars only to have reality beat it out of you year by year? Worst, the "youre perfect" starts out seemingly true: endless sexual attention if youre average, no truly competitive coed environments, money and employment haven't hamstrung your free time, few opportunities to make life altering fuckup decisions. The vast majority of people are absolutely average. That's really got to start crushing the soul after the first decade. As a dude, it starts with "you probably suck at most things, so pick sports or books and stick with it."	I think while guy friends do tend to tease a lot more than girl friends, I know that if I say “real talk” to my guy friends and ask them about any insecurities I might have, they’ll try to help bring me up. Guys may just not be as serious in everyday life
I just found out my parents are getting a divorce after 32 years of marriage. What do I do?	In your case I would not seek out contact with my parents. Talk to your sister or other siblings for support if you think it helps you, but otherwise rely on people outside of your immediate family for support. I think it's a very serious form of disrespect that your parents have kept you out of the loop through their strife, and even more-so that they have already made the decision and still decide to actively keep you uninvolved. The onus is on them to make that right - let them come to you and don't let them shame you for not trying to untangle the mess they've made should they try.	You let them live their life. Chances are that they were unhappy for a long time and just stayed together "for the kids". Let them move on, find other partners and become happy.
Men, do all vaginas feel the same? If not, how do they vary?	Ive had sex with a lot of women (humblebrag) and they most certainly do not feel the same. I had sex with a few moms, and it felt like a cave. One of them was extremely in shape and it still felt like a warm cavern so the whole "they just need exercise to fix that" may not be 100%. Some sluts have tight vaginas, and some more reserved women have loose ones. Its just your body's biology. Everyone is different. Some of the cleanest girls have had the worst smells and some of the grimy girls I have fucked tasted and smelled excellent. No correlation between taste, smell, and feeling though. Still working on a hypothesis.	As a happily married man with an active sex life, I can tell you that even the SAME vagina doesn't feel the same all the time.
What are your thoughts on hanging out with exes or former sexual partners while in a relationship?	People who are opposed to this don't hang out with their own exes and honestly that probably means that their exes were never friends—only lovers—and that their current lovers also are not their friends. "Oh hey love chemicals dried up; I guess that means you have nothing to offer me any more as a person if I can't get that drug high from you any more kthxbye". It's in general symptomatic of a way of interacting I don't want with anyone including my lovers and it tends to also come coupled with "all my friends are of sex A and all my lovers of sex B"	I trust my partner but it would still make me uncomfortable. If he asked to go hang out with his ex, I wouldn’t say no but I’d still say I’d prefer he didn’t.
Do you ever have intrusive thoughts? What are they?	Having to use my inner demons to harness absolute murderous rage if something were to happen to my son. The thing is, when I joined the Marines after 9/11, to get revenge and kill as many of those fuckers are possible. I got my wish for that. So, every so often, I hear that little demon screaming "You know, if anything happens to the boy, I'm right here if you need me. Just say the word, and we get to hear the screams again"	I often randomly imagine how I'd react if one or both of my parents suddenly died. Like a horrific car accident or something. It typically just bums me out for a few seconds until I think "why am I thinking this"
What suprised you about women's bodies?	Hste to sound arrogant, how quickly they get wet and orgasm, for me it was harder to get off. The media paints it like all men premature ejaculate and all women are hard to satisfy. I was fucking girls so hard they were passing out from pleasure. I dont even have a big dick. Its adverage. Lick the clit, rub the roof of the pussy on the g spost and alternate that with deep thrusts of your fingers. Providing to have a slowly increasing rythm they will cum. Easy as that. I was amazed at how connected they were with it to...amazing watching a woman in extacy and knowimg you creating it. Makes you feel likethe man..lol.	How shit periods are. I’ve said I would like to experience what it’s like to have a period but honestly I don’t think it’s worth it. My girlfriend doesn’t complain about it but she gets sore boobs before, gets bloated, gets cramps, has sore boobs after, plus the actual blood, the pads, fear of drips, cleaning up, period poos. Then there’s the pretending like nothing’s wrong when I know she is in agony, for instance at social gatherings that are unavoidable or planned months in advance.
Everyone has that one girl they can’t get out of their heads. What’s she like? Are you with her?	This one girl in my spanish class Don't know her name but she had a really fat ass, I was pretty astonished by it Yes I am shallow and don't know her name, grade, etc.	>What’s she like? I honestly don't know anymore. But back when I saw her every day she was perfect. >Are you with her? No, and almost certainly never will be. I'll have to find another.
What's something women tend to be insecure about but you find hot?	Lots of prior partners. If I meet a girl and she admits that she’s lost count of how many people she’s slept with but ballparks it at “I dunno, a couple hundred?”, I’m ready to move in together and get a join checking account.	Tall girls almost always wish they were shorter. If I’m attracted, I only see it as a plus. There’s more of her to wrap around me.
AskMen, what story will make us jealous of your relationship with your SO?	Does all the house work Dinner on table every night Will offer BJ randomly Has never said no anytime I've asked for sex Will get coked up with me and watch porn, whilst also blowing me off. Will tongue my arse if I wanted her to. Cracking set of tits, nice legs and beautiful face. Probably more that I don't even notice.	We dont fight, she gives me earth shattering blowjobs 3-4 times a week on top of sex, she looks like a sexy librarian, she is a great cook, she is fun to be around despite being quite reserved, she has the same hobbies as me, and she smells like vanilla and almonds without any deoderant on, and she lets me dote on her like we are highschool love birds. Also she is a nurse so nothing ever grosses her out. We've been together for 8 years and I know it makes me a lucky man.
How do you feel about other guys saying stuff like "I wish that happen to me" on cases in which a (female) teacher slept with a minor (male)?	I'm going to go against the group here and say that I would agree with them. I was a horny little fuck, and even though I'd likely have been super nervous/anxious about having sex (much less having sex with a teacher), I definitely would have jumped at the chance had it been presented.	I mean, sure, 13 year old me thought the idea of fucking a hot teacher was awesome. But that kid was 13, and we should not take him seriously.
Do attractive men get hit on as much as we think they do? How do you react to compliments?	So I have a relatively high number. However, I still know that I have blown more opportunities than I have closed the deal on. I get hit on more than I know but I refuse to inwardly acknowledge because I have a lifetime of sabotaging my own success. I still continue in life like I’m shit and delusionaly rationalize away all compliments. I get enough pussy I guess but I could do better.	It’s weird because the role is usually guys make the first move or initiate some sort of conversation when they find a woman attractive. When you’re a good looking guy, more gay guys hit on you than women......it’s such a cosmic joke fml.
Men, what was something a woman said to you innocently that actually hurt you instead?	I was dressed down a bit more than normal since I was due to run some laundry, and a (non penile-equipped) friend of mine said something to the effect of "If you dressed better you would be really attractive" I made her *suffer* for like a week. I still don't know what prompted her to say something like that.	“You were my second hardest heart break” . She broke up with me actually. But why you gotta put a number on it?
Why or why shouldn’t I take up a Western name, as an international student?	My friend came to my uni internationally and he has a really long first name/shorter last name so he just goes by his last name. If that’s the same case for you, where your last name is shorter and easier to pronounce, you could do that from a social standpoint.	I would try to make a short form that is pronounced easily by Westerners. For example my buddy Akshay goes by A.k.
Interracial couples of AskMen: What is something you experience that you think other couples probably don’t?	Jesus, I’m glad I don’t live in America. The idea of being glared at or being called a “race traitor” for dating someone of a different ethnicity is crazy.	My wife says she gets a lot of stink-eye from white women, and a lot of wink-nods from black women. I don't notice any of this and nobody has ever said anything racist to me about it, but at a club once I got fist-bumped by a random black man. I was confused and my wife had to explain to me what it was about.
Men who had an awesome ex, why was she awesome and why is she your ex?	They're ex's because they lacked values I'd say they were cool however, the word awesome is reserved for a very select few individuals in my life, an ex would not be one of those individuals.	She could make me feel like I was the only man in the world with just a look. Always asked questions about topics she was curious about. Wasn't afraid to have incredible discussions on any subject. Always said good morning and goodnight to me every single day. Made me feel welcome in her home, as if I had been part of the family all her life. Always praised my accomplishments and pushed me to be the best version of myself I could be. Loved travelling and was extremely passionate about anything she put herself towards. Was an absolute goddess in the bedroom. Left me for another guy the day my mom passed from cancer.
Has an ex girlfriend ever told you years later that they still had feelings for you? If so, how did that make you feel?	Yea like fucking all of them because I just roll back through exes and haven’t seriously been with a new girl in a decade. It makes me feel kind of awesome. They go away they see the world and as much as ten years later want another shot with me. I guess I’m not so bad. Clarification : I never have bad breakups. Almost always circumstantial or we just drift apart and agree to move on.	Yeah, my ex who cheated on me 3 times decided to message me a whole year later with a massive paragraph on how she fucked up and wanted me back. By massive it had to be sent in 3 messages because it exceeded the character limit in iMessage. I just read it, then deleted it. Fuck that bitch.
What would you think if the girl you’ve been dating gave you a topless Polaroid photo?	Trust me on this. Don't send the photo. Here's what'll happen: * he might open it at an inappropriate time making it embarass him * he might open it and then get worked up and blueballed * (worst case) he'll think you have no morals for sending such stuff INSTEAD, I recommend you write up a really romantic letter. Bonus points if you include artistically drawn hearts and lots of girly handwriting. THEN, when you end up coming home, if you can arrange it, arrange it so that you end up at home before he gets done with work or something. Then when he walks in that door, greet him topless. He will ravish you.	Very attractive and a good kind of weird. There's something about the physical feeling of paper that you don't get with digital photos on your phone and it feels a lot more intimate, at least to me. It's quite the surprise.
Men of reddit, with report after report of diamonds being worthless. What do you think men will be proposing with other than diamond engagement rings?	Strictly speaking, gold and silver are near-worthless, too, except for perception. You will find that most great things in life require a buy-in of one sort or another. If you want a long-term, committed relationship with an extraordinary woman, this is your buy-in. Let's be completely honest; in most cases she is getting the shorter end of the stick when it's all said and done, anyway. No pun intended...	There are a lot cooler gems colourwise I think getting one that is her favourite colour is a good idea
Men of Reddit. I was just informed by my wife that I am going to be a father. I was very supportive when she told. However, inside I am freaking out. I know I must be strong. But, dear god help me survive this. What do now?	I'd talk to my pregnant wife about how I'm feeling instead of making a Reddit thread, but that's just me. Remember: she's the one who's pregnant. You think you're scared?	The easiest way to fake your death is at sea. Charter a boat, take a ride when storms are forecast. Have someone else meet on a second boat and sink the first boat. Start new life on beach of your choosing.
Men who got bullied when young, how much do you think the bullying shaped your personality?	Made me tough as nails, but compassionate towards people being bullied. That being said, I don’t coddle them. I offer them the tools I used to be better and if they choose not to rise above they deserve to be bullied.	I don't trust people. I don't open up to people and am very shy with new people. I'm desperate for people to like me and am a people pleaser. it affected me too much.
What can be done about people you have ghosted?	I was unaware anything ever needed to be done. Ghosting's fine. It keeps you distant, they can go full nuclear-meltdown on their own without threatening your life.	I'm always interested in how anti ghosting Reddit is. I've never once had a woman not ghost me, like I've never had a woman say something like "hey, not interested anymore, but good luck out there" and to be honest, I don't know if I'm just used to it now, but I'm not sure saying anything would be any different. Being ghosted is pretty clear, and if you liked the person it sucks, but so would any possible thing they could say. I get it's different for OP just because of the time frame, I'm talking first or second date. .
What is something you find secretly attractive about a girl?	Feminine, friendly personality. I've seen a few 5's or 6's who exude femininity. That alone boosts them to a 7 or a 7, since I've realized not to go on strictly looks. Even 9's and 10's with a bitchy, masculine personality will knock them down to a 5 or a 6 in my book.	I have a thing for big / odd noses. Like I find Sara Bareilles super attractive, and I think a lot of that is her nose. Thing is, you can't really tell a girl "I love your big nose", so I usually keep that to myself.
Those of you that stopped actively looking for a girlfriend and decided to just have fun and commit to self-improvement, how did that go?	You wanna know what happened? I got a girlfriend. The second you stop worrying about stuff like that and simply love yourself and become the best version of yourself that you can, good things will come your way.	I have lost 40 plus pounds, my running had improved greatly and I am making strides in overcoming PTSD and have relearned how to be the source of my own happiness and while I am often okay with solitude I also have no friends and sometimes feel so alone that it physically hurts
I became a first time mother to a son in January. What did your mom do right when raising you? What do you wish she'd known about raising a boy?	If you want to win mom of the year, just look up the reddit myth on the kid who broke both his arms.	There are two things my mom did that I always appreciated: There's that stereotype that men are hopeless without women but my mom always held my female peers to higher scrutiny. That way I could see that girls are just as flawed as boys and that I was worth something in a relationship. You could always hold someone to too much scrutiny and that would be an issue but she struck a balance that helped keep my romantic interests a bit more grounded. She would also always ask me if I could pause my video games before she asked me to do something. That was a very small courtesy but it was appreciated during boss battles.
Something I never understood, how long do couples normally wait before being exclusive/labeling the relationship?	I usually wait several months, but given my druthers I'd be a relationship anarchist and never bother defining things at all. My girlfriend and I still aren't exclusive, but we're clearly in a committed relationship. It took me two years to put it on facebook though.	Best of luck OP, all I can say... My wife STILL gives me shit about how back when we were dating, we'd been dating for like two months and finally she was like "So are we boyfriend and girlfriend or what?" I wasn't super experienced at dating, but even then asking her "Do you want to be my girlfriend?" felt really dumb and corny. I just assumed once a person was outside of high school that people just assumed these titles one they'd been together a certain amount of time. That'll be like 12 years ago this June. Still hearing about it.
What’s the biggest misconception about what a healthy relationship should look like?	Absolute sexual and romantic monogamy. It's not for everyone, and that general view of healthy relationships IMO is a reason why divorce rates are so high and people cheat so much. Relationships are not always 50:50 either, and it's not fair to think it should be that way all the time. Healthy relationships fluctuate as needed. Some days it will be 90:10 one way, and others it will be 10:90.	That you love doing the same things. You might love doing a couple of the same things, but chances are you have your things, they have their things and sometimes you do them together simply because it's important to the one you love (but not really your favorite thing).
What is the douchiest thing about you?	I laugh at my own jokes, pretty loudly. &nbsp; Also that logic is kind of silly depending on how fit you are, clothing is obviously going to be tighter. Following that logic, people wearing clothing that fit them must be douchy? Weirdest assumption & logic I've heard lol. &nbsp; Sounds like an insecure person coming up with any reason to dislike someone so they feel mentally justified that they're still superior because they have a "better personality". ( I wonder if they see the irony in how shallow judging & assuming things about others is.) &nbsp; Dress how you want, don't let insecure people dictate how you should dress because they're going to make some comments. That's just the jealousy talking, ignore it, rock it, live & enjoy your life and watch them get angry/upset.	I try not to judge people by what they wear. I fail and constantly judge people by what they wear.
What is it about your current SO that makes them so different than others you’ve been involved with?	We share the same height even though I am not short, she is much more socially extrovert and outgoing than me (has 700 facebook friends while I have 70) and mildly socially dominates me (without arrangement or consent, ordering me not to watch porn sometimes or we won't have sex). I wouldn't say she is a mother figure to me but more like I am very very young so my rich parents paid professional female tutor for me to help me through life.	My past girlfriends, no offense to them, have been kinda dumb. It was always frustrating as hell when they would get mad at me over some little thing and there was no rationalizing with them. My current SO on the other hand is really intelligent. It's amazing what she can come up with. She always has insightful opinions on things. We get along great because we can both voice our thoughts well. It feels like more of a partnership than some sort of competition. She's pretty great.
What dates have you guys gone on where it started off really good, but then had an unexpected turn for the worse?	About 5-4 years ago I went on a date with a girl that knew my ex and we bonded a bit trashing her and then went bowling. Everything was great until we went to an eatnpark afterwards. We got into the topic of religion. Well. I believe when you die, you are dead. And she is a hardcore Christian girl. Needless to say I offended her a bit with my beliefs.	Went on a second date after a stellar first date. Go to an Italian restaurant great food. The whole time since the first date she's asking when she can meet my dogs because they are so cute. After a great meal I ask if she wants to come back to my place to meet the dogs. She says "yes"; oh boy here we go this date is only getting better. We get to my place; she instantly starts sneezing and coughing. Turns out she's allergic to dogs. Drive her home never hear from her again.
Would you want to know if your SO made a one night mistake and made out with someone else on a night out? Why or why not?	Lol you got dumped because you whored it up one night, didn't you? My answer: You better take it to your grave because I'm leaving you if you tell me.	I'd want to know, purely because secrets usually come out eventually and it's better finding out now than in 2 years time
What can an ugly woman do to be seen as worthy of love?	Be willing to be with a man who's just as ugly. If you don't like that option then you either need to absolutely luck the fuck out or get less ugly yourself.	"I do try to be upbeat and cheerful but the loneliness eats away at me" OP, hang in there. You're doing all the right things like putting yourself out there. Opportunity will come at random points in your life; the more you meet new people the more chances you get of meeting that special someone who wants to share the rest of their life with you.
Men who explore abandoned buildings and other locations. What’s the craziest/scariest thing you’ve stumbled upon?	Came across some gang members in an abandoned warehouse. They had fire in their eyes and their words were very clear. They're out to get me, I knew i should leave I can but I didn't want to be a boy I wanted to be a man. I wanted to stay alive, better do what i can. I wanted to show them that I was'n't really scared but I was playing with my life it wasn't a game of truth or dare, but I wanted to be bad.	Some homeless dwellings. Few times when the "owner" was there (mostly very friendly when showed respect). Weird dolls and graffiti in an abandoned Asylum, but it was a popular spot so we expected other visitors to put them there. Nothing that scary or crazy. Cities are actually very safe unless you get shot. Which is still rare.
Why did she fall out of love with you?	I was too beta. Poor frame, didn't lift heavy enough, too chubby and short, severe oneitis, and mistakenly believed I could turn a ho into a housewife.	It's less that she fell out of love with me, and more that while I was gone for work, someone else was around, and she fell in love with him.
Men who hate your ex girlfriend(s), what did they do to warrant such hate?	Not hate because it would imply on some level that I care but if you’re to list some things it would be she charged too much on my credit, ordered my housekeeper of 20 years around like she was her personal assistant, destroyed a car I was letting her use and got a breast reduction. If I’m going to just nail it down to one thing though I’d definitely say the breast reduction was the deal breaker.	She cheated and lied to me multiple times. Took my money and my car and that was all I was good for. Made me feel worthless like I was less of a man and wouldn’t ever be good enough for her. I have a lot of trust issues now. Also trying to gain my confidence back. Long road ahead but I do wish her the absolute worst.
What would you warn young men about women when advising them about dating?	Love her but don't trust her - women are often ruled by emotion and there integrity is based in the moment unlike men who are loyal like dogs	Don't depend on anyone else to make you happy. Don't worry about what others think of you. 20 minutes with a condom is better than 20 years of child support and baby mama drama.
Men who were cheated on in a LTR, how long until you were able to trust someone in a relationship again (or were you unable to)?	Women cheat. Say it with me: women cheat. It's what they do, and it's unlikely that you'll find the exceedingly rare forever-faithful type. Don't let their infidelities affect your self-image. Keep future partners at a metaphorical arm's length--no cohabitating, joint finances, or ovum fertilization. You should know in the back of your mind that you can walk away from a relationship at any time with minimal cost. And don't let your relational status get in the way of getting yours.	I think it's one of those things, like your house getting hit by a tornado. You never feared it before because you didn't really think it could happen to you even though you know it's possible. After it happens even though you feel safe in your new house from day to day, storm clouds always bring dread of what may happen.
Men, what first clued you in that a certain woman was batshit crazy?	1. Lots of tats 2. Colored Hair 3. Lots of makeup 4. Lots of guy friends 5. Instagram user 6. Any kind of filters on their pictures 7. Single mothers 8. Has no real hobbies 9. Uses cell phone too much 10. Lazy 11. Entitiled 12. Sends mixed signals 13. Talks crap about other people 14. Clingy/Dependant 15. Never pays 16. Unpredictable emotional swings 17. Gossips 18. Crappy relationship with family 19. Tries to drive a wedge between your current friends/family 20. They guilt trip I could go on but I can sum it up pretty easily. Most women. Before all the soyboys, SJWs and females come to attack me. I said most women not all. I will assume anyone who has a problem with my list is either a women who falls into one or more of these or a man who is looking to virtue signal.	She was legitimately upset at me that I had cheated on her in her dreams with a girl named Erica. Anytime I was going to be hanging out with the guys or just generally not with her, she would ask if I was seeing Erica. I didn’t then, and I still do not know anyone named Erica.
If you and your girl have spoken about marriage in the past, how would you feel if she sent you some engagement ring styles that she likes?	I'd feel emasculated. Like she doesn't trust me well enough to know what she likes (and what I can afford).	My wife picked her own set of rings out in the diamond district in NY. She knew what she wanted and the price range. Remember guys she is going to be wearing this ring for the rest of her life - let her pick it out. I had the money when I proposed and told her we would go the next day and pick out her ring. She got the exact setting and cut she wanted.
Couples who married young (18-21), how is your marriage now?	I'm 21 he's 25, been married 2 months. :) I don't have any regrets. I love him, our beautiful house & two doggies. We have our ups & downs like everyone but I would love to see 10, 20 years in to the future and him still be there. I don't want to be married more than once. I'm happy I settled down. I met the perfect person for me and I only hope we can have a long happy life together.	I got a Lass pregnant when we were both 19, I decided I'd better do the "right" thing and marry her. We've been married 12 years now and have 2 kids and it all worked out alright in the end, but I wouldn't recommend it.
What's the most oddly specific Bro Code article you can come up with?	Article 150: if you still refer to a "bro code" and you are over the age of 18, you need to grow up	If your bro dies while at the gym, first put some more weight on the bar, then call the medical personnel/ authorities.
What have you learned from your past relationships?	Blowjobs are non negotiable. I’m not sorry. I don’t have many needs and blowjobs are definitely one of the only things keeping me sane.	There's no such thing as "waiting for things to get better on their own". Also being more considerate. Taking an interest to the other person's hobbies is huge too. I recently got into D&D and I never thought in a million years that my SO would like it, but she loves playing. So in return I make an effort to do more special date nights etc as my way of thanking her for taking an interest.
Ripped guys, how do you stay so shredded?	i have 5.1% body fat. shredded to the bone. i hate it. putting on weight takes me SO long and i have to eat SOOO much food. Just genetics i guess.	I eat mainly greens, berries, legumes, salmon, tuna, veggie patties, eggs. Sometimes eat rice, cheese, tortillas, pizza, tofu but it's rare. No alcohol, smoking, junk food, sugar, soft drinks, I prefer sparkling water and smoothies. I lift at least 5x a week, go swimming 2x a week, do yoga 2x a week. I sit in the steam room after every workout. On my off days I go for a walk or hike most of the time, sometimes I just rest the whole day. I'm 28. I used to live the exact opposite of this lifestyle a few years ago, trying to go into my 30's firing on all cylinders. edit: forgot to include eggs, one of the best protein sources.
Why do women smell so good?	For me, it's natural selection at work. I'm a heterosexual male; most women smell really good to me, no matter how dirty and sweaty they get. Sometimes they don't, and I've learned to assume there's a good reason for it, evolutionarily, when that happens. For instance, one girl I thought was visually quite attractive early in my life, but who smelled not-so-good to me, later 'came out' as lesbian. Other times I've been with women that I initially didn't fancy so much, but who smelled so good I could hardly stand it.	So a number of years ago, when my older brother was still just dating his now wife, me and his girlfriends younger sister were pretty hot for each other, but we were both a bit hesitant about it because our siblings were dating. One time when we were out camping with buddies, drunk around the campfire she tossed her army jacket at me and it wrapped over my head right as I was inhaling. It was more than just smells. I got goosebumps head to toe, shuddered, and immediately went fully erect. It was a literal slap in the face of pheromones.
Men of Reddit, how has Tinder been going for you ? Any good experiences ? Advice ?	From about 2012/13-2016/17 tinder was fucking fantastic, probably close to 40 lays off it, including 2 of my top 3 hottest girls, but the last year or so its been pretty brutal. The girls that are DTF are ugly as sin, and basically zero girls on there that seem like they would be LTR material. Honestly its heydey has come and gone, I'd stay away from it unless you are in college and just looking to get laid. Now, I will say, in the past couple months I have been traveling a lot more for work and THAT is where tinder is a goldmine. I'm gonna be chilling by myself the entire week anyway, so if i can get a hookup and or a dinner date why not? My company pays for it anyways, and I already got a hotel.	A girl once tried to recruit me in a pyramidal scheme. Otherwise, I got nothing else to say. Oh wait, I also remember one girl saying I was going too fast when I invited her for coffee.
Everyone's heard of fuckboys by now. What is the biggest "fuckgirl" thing you've ever seen?	Awkwardly adds any contemporary faddish word or expression to her vocabulary (crush, shipping etc). Takes any of the Kardashian seriously. Addicted to social media and shitty reality shows.	Show up at the bar/club without money, but expecting to get drunk asking random men she isn't interested in to buy her a drink
How does one recover from accidentally telling their girlfriend that they don't think they're hot?	Jesus Christ, kid. If you could be honest with women like that, this subreddit wouldn't exist. It's a rookie mistake and we hate to see it.	*Catastrophically stupid man tells girlfriend he doesn't think she's hot after she tells him he is hot, learns valuable life lesson of thinking before speaking for his next girlfriend. More at 11.*
How private do you keep your relationship?	No, that's weird. While I never understood keeping relationship a secret, I at least can see maybe at the beginning where you aren't sure if dating is a relationship yet. But, if you have been together going on 5 years, it's well beyond time to make it public. I don't ever agree with the "lets keep this a secret because it's no one's business" mentality because it feels like you aren't proud of your partner. How can you have a healthy, functioning relationship if you are concerned with what people think of you two together. Seriously, fuck all that. Love me, love me publicly.	I don't make an effort to hide a gf, but I am a very private guy. I'll tell people we're together but I won't discuss anything about the relationship and hate being questioned about it. It's noones business but our own.
Men who are frequently complimented, what kind of compliments do you receive?	Not a dude that gets many compliments, but I got a friend who is well educated/groomed and dresses nicely. I've heard him get compliments randomly from women on everything: tie, glasses, shoes, jacket - all on separate occasions. A properly fit wardrobe can do you wonders.	"Dude, you're hilarious, how are you still single?" Same reason I'm on the radio instead of in front of a camera.
Men of Reddit, what do you want to get off your chests or talk about, but feel like you can’t in person?	I think just raw intelligence is only tangentially related to objectivity. The reality is people belive what's comfortable for them. Sometimes that shows you their real priorities in ways you might not like. A smart enough person can rationalize most things. This means all that really stops your freinds and family from hating and leaving you is a persuasive enough argument with enough supporters that puts you at odds.	Shit, dude, I want a hug. Not from a family member. I just really want to hug a friend, or someone whom I like. I yearn to just have sone sort of physical contact with others. I don't know how common this is, but I don't think I'm the only one.
Was your SO "there for the futon and instant noodles?" How did she support you if so? How do you express your gratitude now that things are better?	I had just finished a divorce, all I had for furniture was a dresser and and an office chair. We met, stayed together for 4.5 years - moved 2 hours away for work and survived 2 years of long distance. In the end, she supported me taking a job 2 states away and the distance out an end to things before she could move with me. Now make 3x what I did when we met, have much nicer things and money isn't what caused her to stay for so long or to leave in the end. Actual plot twist - shortly after the initial partner of 4.5 years and I broke up, I met someone at work and am now getting married in November. Much different experience in some ways versus my "rags to riches" experience.	My dad’s wife was. He’s really well off now and she’s younger and skinny and blonde so she catches a lot of assumptions. She was there from the black Astro van and shag brown carpet to the Porsche 911 and the Four Seasons! Love that woman.
What victories did you have this week? What defeats did you have this week?	Fucked a girl so hard she bled. That was a nice feather in my cap. I got killed by Tempered Teostra. I'm better than that.	Victories: Revealed who my true friends are. Caught a would be thief at work. Didn't die (well it's a victory.) Defeats: Revealed who were not my friends. Got dumped by girl of my dreams and lost her friendship (were close friends for over a decade). So I call it a bad week. Onwards and upwards.
For those of you who have/had feelings for a female friend but never told her; why didn’t you say anything?	From the 8th grade to about my Senior year in high school, I had a crush on one girl named Nnandi Davis. She used to say "hi" and talk to me sometimes, but I was extremely shy and thought that it was a bad thing to be straightforward about my interest in her. Eventually I found out around the school that she had a boyfriend, and I was a little upset with myself for not making a move on her sooner and at least letting her know that I liked her.	This was a common thing for me in high school and college, and while my excuse was fear of rejection, the reality is that it was a mix of either one-sided adoration or unwillingness to take a risk. In my adult life, I've spent time with people and tried to see if feelings emerge mutually. A part of it is, as an adult, I tend to meet people either directly for dating purposes (i.e., meet someone at a party/event/bar and ask them out right there), or through a mutual activity where bonding occurs simultaneously. There are just fewer opportunities for this "longing" to occur.
What are some qualities of a manipulator?	"You never ______" - literally had this happen to me in the last 20 minutes. For him it was "you never laugh at my jokes." You never do this for me, you never do that for me. You do this all the time for whoever, but you don't ever do it for me. Its subtle intrusion and manipulation. Your feelings and reactions are not important and don't have to be genuine, but my feelings are more important.	Manipulators will make you feel like everything is always somehow your fault. You'll find yourself apologizing for things you really shouldn't have to, and trying to avoid upsetting them is like walking on eggshells.
How has a girl creeped you out?	Coming on too strong. I hate to admit this because usually I swear I like when girls take initiative but when they start locking down a relationship, it kind of creeps me out. Maybe its the commitment that creeps me out?	Some lady at the beach started telling my daughter the dangers of talking to strangers. I had to inform her that right now _she_ was *the stranger*.
Why is it that some men often come off as oblivious to the fact that they're handsome and the fact that someone is attracted to them?	As an attractive male i was always oblivious unwanted female attention. Connection requires both parties to pickup the phone. The difference between men and women is that women will use unwanted male attention to setup backup boyfriends or get free shit or cry victimhood.	Part of it is because what a lot of women think are "obvious hints" of attraction aren't really obvious at all.
How do I, a gay man, befriend straight guys without them thinking I am hitting on them?	The same way a straight male befriends another straight male? You rub dicks together and then you're friends; this isn't that hard.	you don't hit on them. You talk about stuff you have in common and do it and whatever. Just don't flirt while doing it? If they say "are you hitting on me" say "no, sorry if I came across like that" and that's it
How do you guys feel about someone telling you to watch your language around women?	He comes from a time when men respected women and vice Versa - this generation morals and values have gone out the window any 90% of people. If the kind of music played in today's society was played 80 years back they would be locked up etc. Times have changed and not for the better. It is what it is. You can't blame the old man from coming from his times as much as you can't blame the young guys for being part of this generation. Values, standards, integrity etc has been changed for personal gain, mediocracy and fitting in. It is what it is - How I personally feel? It depends on the woman ;)	I don't watch my language depending on whether or not women are present, I watch my language depending on what social setting I am in. At work? At home? In public? That's really the only thing that matters to me.
What's your biggest life struggle right now?	Trying to get a job so my parents don't kick me out. I'm 17 like damn guys. You could have warned me first. I thought I didn't have to work but apparently they've been holding it against me for a while. Wish people could just talk about what's bothering them.	A sense of lostness and lack of direction. Dwindling mental health. And the intense fear that sooner or later i’ll just stay asleep forever or grow bitter. I’m really scared
College students of AskMen, how are you doing?	I'm doing okay. My grades are decent and my social life is going well but I think it's time I find a girl to build a relationship with.	After going through a breakup and likely failing 2 classes, I’m back on my feet and doing great.(besides my gpa, rip)
What do men like about being straddled by a woman?	talk about trying to get into the head of someone, OPs follow up questions are intense to say the least	Love it. It shows a level of interest that I appreciate, and there's something very sexy about being pinned under her, too.
For the first time in over a decade my weight this morning was under 230 pounds, what are you feeling good about today?	Congrats on your weight loss. If you'd like to lose more quickly a water only fast did wonders for me.	Didn't really know what to do in my 30 minute break, so I just went to the nearby park and laid down in the sun. That was just nice and very relaxing.
How can a man have a best friend that is a girl and also have a girlfriend?	Haha oh he can’t. Anyone saying otherwise is full of shit. Show me all the happily married men with female best friends, oh that’s right, they don’t exist. Same goes for women having guy best friends. Not going to work. PC society wants to say it can, find me an example first then we’ll talk.	Yes. Men are allowed to cultivate friendships with other women and no, that doesn't mean they are attracted to them. My SO and I have best friends of the opposite sex, neither of us is afraid that we're going to cheat with those friends. It's about having trust in your SO and the relationship you're building.
Men who regret getting married, what’s your reason?	ITT: men who got divorce raped. Edit: the fact that I'm getting downvotes on this paints a really clear picture of what'll happen to you all... Don't say you weren't warned. At least get a prenup if you're thinking of being dumb enough to get married in today's world.	She never loved me. She married me because she thought it would force her to develop feelings. Waste of time
What is your most fappable sexual fantasy that you don't plan to do in real life?	Making some hipster (tattoos, skinny fat, large glasses) college chick cheat on her soy-boy-friend with me. Breeding the alt bitch in the process (with my super male vitality seed) and then, totally organically, beta boyfriend steps in and marries to take care of "our" genetically superior kid. After few years I cum back. IRL I would do just consensual cuckolding without breeding, everybody done stuff I listed?	Probably a eightsome with a bunch of hot college girls where they hold me down, then an even hotter, shy kind of gal is sat down on me by the others where the objective is stop me from pulling out. NSFW tag *please*!
I share a cubicle wall with someone annoying, who among other things, plays music loudly through a bluetooth speaker. Rather than deal with this maturely how I can subtly mess with this person?	If he leaves his jacket on his chair, wipe your arse on his collar. He'll be smelling your ripper all the way home!	Get your own bluetooth speaker, set it to the same volume, and play the exact song they're playing... out of sync by however long it takes you to recognize and find the song.
Men of Reddit, what do women seem to think you don’t care about but in reality, you actually DO?	Makeup. Please wear makeup. If you show up to a date with no makeup, it's just telling me you don't give a fuck. I put my best look out there, and you didn't.	How you treat me You may think we don't notice all the subtleties and nuances, but we do, your actions speak volumes about you as a long term partner. If we feel like we're always the bad guy, and nothing we do is good enough, we're going to leave, simple as that. Reason I say this is because some people seem to think as long as the sex it's fine right? No, the sex can feel empty and hollow, almost soul crushing when you feel like the person is just using it as bait or to keep you around.
We have a sticky thread discussing masculinity as well as its toxic variations. What do you think are examples of toxic femininity and what can women and men do to reduce instances of it?	No such thing as toxic masculinity or toxic femininity. Its called being an asshole. Ive met guys who were huge tools and were dicks and ive met girls who were huge cunts. Its a PEOPLE problem not gender.	The petty and passive aggressive atmosphere at some work places with women is pretty damn toxic. Something about the way woman are socialized to act around "competition" mixed with forced professionalism causes it I think.
Men of reddit, how many friends do you communicate with on a daily basis using chat or text mesages?	Girl here. Question for you guys. It seems like you guys don’t really text daily that often whereas I text my female friends daily. I’ve tried texting a guy I’m friends with daily but he doesn’t ever seem to initiate. We (very briefly) dated before and broke it off and are now friends. Should I just lay off and let him do his thing or keep reaching out? I know friendships between two girls and between two guys can be different and I want to be more understanding and conscious of that without being the “cool girl”	None that are daily. There are about 3 separate people that I try to chat with once every few weeks or so. None of them ever message me first so I don't want to be bothering them too often. I am very lonely.
What advice would you give your younger self prior to first breakup?	Girl here. Don’t send him nudes. They’ll end up being distributed to about 1200 people over the course of the next two years. He is not worth it. Don’t let him ruin your life.	This will make you into such a better person. It will be a long emotionally brutal recovery but you will be happy with the person that comes out of it!
Do you mind doing all the "heavy lifting" during sex? Why or why not?	In this thread: "I don't want a girl who doesn't do anything." Maybe if you were delivering the goods, she would be more animated. You have to give her a reason to get moving.	It depends on what you mean by "heavy lifting." Are you asking if I mind if my partner plays the submissive or pliant role while I take charge? No, of course not. We prefer it that way. Are you asking if I'm cool with my partner being effectively non-participating, non-vocal, starfishy, etc? Fuck no.
Men of Reddit, what was the biggest "reality-check" you've gotten?	I never had any luck dating. I had a good job. I had friends. I was working out 6 days a week lifting and running marathons. I went to speed dating 3 nights. I didnt get one date. I realized I can like myself self. Genuinely be proud of who I was. Be the person I want to be by my definition, and none of that matters. Its not enough to get a date. Self improvement as a way to get the life you want as far as dating and SO's was all BS.	How I couldn't even get a call back for an entry level job after I graduated. Even when I had 3 summers of relevant internship experience and graduated with a bachelor's degree in a STEM field. I'm going to be finishing my Master's degree in December and I'm still worried about finding a job.
What is something your SO does or wears that instantly turns you off?	My ex used to do frequent waxing on her legs and pubic region. It was absolutely disgusting. The hair never grew back correctly, it was always sparse and had a weird texture. Waxing is now a dealbreaker for me. Also too much makeup is gross. It doesn't smell good, it looks slimy, it catches sweat and has a weird texture.	She talks in this fucking fake anime voice whenever we're not in public. She does it constantly at home and it's ok for a while but it starts to really aggregate me. I get it's all "cute" and whatever but after a long day at work i want to unwind without having a conversation in high pitched sailor moon squeals
What was the worse advice you were given regarding women/girls?	“Nice guys finish last”, as a positive advice. Meaning, “you should always let a woman walk before you.” Really, the phrase is literal. The nice guys are the last ones to pair off. Don’t be nice.	“Bro, if she (insert meaningless every day activity or basic friendly human interaction), it means she wants you.” Sure, Brent. I’m pretty sure she smiled, asked how my day was going, and asked me my name was because I just ordered a coffee...but sure, she totally wants my junk. Why not.
What is something that you've done to a woman that would make you mad if someone did the same to your daughter?	Pulled her hair, choked her, spanked her, fucked her throat, fucked her in the ass, fucked another woman while she watched and diddled herself.... the list just goes on	She said I love you. I said it back because I "had to", despite planning to break up with her. It's almost 2 years ago now, and I still hate myself for that.
So, if no contact with an ex does nothing to get her off your mind, then what?	Gym routine + nutrition program + yoga + just reading a god damn book fiction or non fiction. Fixes everything... pretty sure its what modern day buddha would recommend.	I don't know your situation but, if you two only went out for 2 months, have you maybe considered that this might not be about her? Maybe you are fixating on her to avoid facing other issues you are dealing with. Also, the last line sounds like depression; talking to a therapist might be really helpful for you. Good luck dude!
Would you date a girl who dyed her hair unnatural colors? Why or why not?	How could this possibly be a deal breaker...? You're gonna not date someone because of the color of their hair? I'd say that's a little shallow.	On a dating app, I'd probably swipe past. If I knew her first and she was cool, not a deal breaker. Historically though, have not been impressed with people that change their hair colour frequently, or have an obnoxious shade.
Men of Reddit, what are your biggest frustrations with women who are in their 20s?	Just the vapid idiocy. I mean, I was probably the same way, but I'm tired of being told how the world works by someone who's barely an adult and is still sheltered enough that they can afford to die their hair pink.	How a lot of women just... dont do anything. How am I supposed to establish connection with you when your interests are Netflix, Instagram, and drinks with friends?
Gents - how do deal with feelings of "lagging behind" in your life?	>Thanks baby boomers for a shit housing market. You are never truly an adult until you stop blaming your parents for your problems... You are adding to your problems. Instead of just wanting a house badly, you now have the problem of feeling angry, frustrated, and demotivating yourself. Everybody wants things they can't have or have when they want it. Don't punish yourself. Identify and focus on things you can control. Keep your attention there. You may not get the house any sooner, but you will not be making yourself miserable in the meantime. If you still don't feel better consider volunteering to help people out who aren't as well off as you. It really makes you feel better fast.	I’m in a very similar position to you in LA, but a year younger. Living life according to some arbitrary timeline isn’t going to get us anywhere. For me, nothing has worked out according to schedule anyways. But it has worked out! So what’s the rush? Your married friends with kids or houses may be wildly unfulfilled or feel trapped. Imagine when you’re an old 85+ geezer, will you really be concerned whether or not you had those things at 31 vs 35 vs 38? A few years here and there are nothing in a lifetime.
When did you realize you were dating an idiot?	This is finally a thread to which I have the perfect story. Keep in mind this girl was a relatively new driver, maybe a month in. I dated her in high school. She asked me while driving us somewhere how to roll down the windows in the car. About fourty five minutes later she said she needed to get gas and asked how to do it. I broke up with her that night. Edit: apparently it's normal to grow up around cars and not know how to operate the windows. Additionally it is totally normal that after thirty days or more into driving a car every day, a smart human still hasn't learned to work the gas tank or the BUTTON to roll a window down.	Not me, but the poor sod in the row in front of me at the cinema. After our showing of Inglorious Basterds, the girlfriend was getting out of her seat and said to her assumed boyfriend - “It’s amazing that that’s how Hitler actually died like” To which the boyfriend, sort of sadly, replied, - “Babe... we’ve talked about the TV thing” Leading me to believe that this is a running problem.
What’s a fashion tip every man should know (modified from AskWomen) ?	After browsing reddit for years I’ve learned that baggy clothes, low-sagging pants, and beat up shoes are all pretty good things to wear.	Fit and matching of colors is more important than brand. Also, in the warmer weather, roll up your dress shirt sleeves. If you’ve got some forearms, most woman I know tends to dig that look. I’m sure some ladies looking at this will back me up on that.
When did you have to cut a person you cared for out of your life?	Around 5 years ago I decided to cut out all the people (I'm not gonna call them friends because you never know who is your enemy or friend) around me, because we moved to a new country and I was tired of their bullshit asking about new environment, deleted all my social media for the same reason.	I've never cut anyone out, but I've been cut out many times. I'm just posting here because I read all these stories and they made me sad and made me want to share. I'm a single 36-year-old single guy. My family isn't great so I've always loved my friends hard. The thing is most of them get married or move away and contact just sort of fades away until it's nothing more than the occasional happy birthday text and a promise to get together soon. It really sucks, but you can't fight it. It's just how things go here. It's just hard when you're always the one who values the relationship more.
How do you differentiate a natural fading of lust in a LTR from an actual and irreparable lack of sexual desire that would be fatal for the relationship?	Who is teaching people about sex? This isn’t confusing. If you’re not that into her, it ain’t gonna work. People think relationships are about feelings and emotions. No, that’s the icing. Relationships are about sex. And if you’re not that into her, you need to find the one you are. Personality and love do not keep a long term relationship. Every marriage I have seen survive is because they both are very much into each other physically. Lust doesn’t fade. Excitement does.	A big part of it is what the purpose of sex is to you. People who stay in 50 year relationships banging the whole way through dont view sex the same as someone who has had 50 exciting partners. Typically LTR that involve regular, lustful sex uses sex as a tool to reaffirm love/trust/acceptance/forgiveness and other squishy feelings. Exciting sex with new people is a celebration of just how sexy and charismatic you both are by engaging in the greatest feeling in the world. As the hormones and new relationship energy dies away, the need to celebrate this is lessened. That's my view anyways.
Men who have wives or girlfriends, how much failure in the dating game did you go through before you met the right woman for you?	I'm not going to call it 'failure', because it wasn't. I've had a ton of success with women in my life. I compare it to 'sifting through garbage' until you found that hidden gem. To qualify this: I am in my early thirties, have had sex with approximately 220 - 250 different women, hooked up with (everything except sex) with about the same and probably just gone out with around ~1000 since I was in my late teens. I can count on one hand the amount of girls I legitimately enjoyed spending my time with and wanted a relationship with.	Honestly, not much. I'm 14 years past the game, but I was a bad player. I was such a bad player I rarely played. This cost me a whole lot of experience, but not quality outcomes. I had only a few bad, or unsuccessful experiences, and still had the relationships that mattered. The relationships that mattered fell in my lap. When I chased it, it always sucked. And there was a lot of forearm exercise in between.
Men who are in great shape and good health in their forties and beyond, how did you do it and how are you managing it?	I'm killing it at 48. I have been partying my whole life. Look great, feel great, never get sick or injured. Been with many women. It's a genetic lottery. I'm lucky. Live at the beach and have fun. Vanity helps. But I'm not wasting my life in a gym. I've got fun to do.	My dad did it as a coping mechanism during my parents' divorce. Probably not the "healthiest" way to get healthy, but definitely one of the healthier obsessions to throw yourself into. He was pretty fit in his 20s and into his 30s, so I think he really latched onto to doing all the stuff he hadn't been able to do in 20 or so years.
Men, how does it feel to have your desires and needs ignored?	It's not any different from any other day. Women are people, men are resources. Men who are bad at being resources get attacked/discredited/shamed/belittled. Men who are good at being resources get **tolerated**. For now.	If it isn't working you say goodbye and find someone more compatible. It's nobody's job to do things they don't want to do. Wouldn't want to be with someone who isn't absolutly thrilled to 'fulfill my desires'.
What’s the most important realization you’ve made about women?	I don't think they actually care about men, they've just reached a point where they act like the men they claim to hate.	I had this realization when I was a teenager and it served me well: there's no one thing women want. There are different things that different women want. As such, acting like someone else to get dates will only get you with women who want someone else. Instead, you just show who you really are, and the women who actually like that will reveal themselves to you over time.
What is your favorite course in Mario Kart , and what character do you play as the most?	Rainbow Road in Mario Kart 64. If I'm racing I usually try for a medium weighted character like Mario or Luigi.	I don't have a favorite track but I always play as princess peach. It annoys my children cause they say a man can not play as the princess and I tell them I can be a princess if I want.........Its just my little way of giving them mental issues as they grow up.
Fellow men of Reddit, how was dating in your 20’s different than dating in 30’s (or was it the same)?	The older I get the less I trust or respect women. Dating went from an attempt to find true love to a collection of single moms who come over for sex when schedules permit. I'm sure the women didn't change, just my perspective over time.	Well, the older I got the more picky I got, and the more baggage everyone had. Mid 20s was more difficult than later or early 20s. At about 22-24 the girls your age are hitched or want an older guy, at about 29 all of a sudden a flood of younger girls want you because you're somewhat established, and they want in on the ride.
Anybody ever feel like they've "outgrown" their longtime friends? How did you handle it?	You got to be able to shut that person out of your life if they hold you back. Sounds cruel, but that’s just what I had to learn with my former best.	Before a certain age, our set of friends is constrained by geography. As you get older, you realize you can have friends that actually have similar interests.
Married men of reddit: what was your favorite thing about your wedding?	Didn’t get into debt for one day, didn’t have a massive fuss, I wore what ever the fuck I wanted, including shorts, converse and a SnapBack.	Lots of things but one decision we made that in retrospect I’m really glad we did. They had us go to a back room while all the guests were filtering in and they had all the buffet food there for us. We had like 10-15 mins to eat before going in because at a lot of weddings the bride and groom don’t have a chance to sit down or eat
My boss (F 60s) told me “most men don’t read” when she saw me reading. What’s the most ridiculous generalization of men you’ve ever heard?	She isn't wrong. Most people in general do not "read" (assuming she meant literature). She just chose to focus on a specific gender.	My dad's new girlfriend recently told me, "I've only met one other male who can cook besides you." I cook simple meals because the rest of my family would end up eating only take out if I didnt cook. You mean you've only ever met 2 adult men capable of making pasta and chicken?
How enthusiastic does your SO get when it comes to giving oral sex?	My woman gives UNBELIEVABLE Head... and, she swallows. But, her VijayJay is even more UNBLEIVABLE. Though, I admit I give her Waayyy... more head than she gives me, and I Love it just as much as getting it.	I only get it when she feels like it and so the degrees vary. She is always pretty enthusiastic but i can tell how horny she is by how hard she goes at it.
If you were going to restart your life at 33, how would you start the process?	If you haven't done anything towards your retirement, go at it full strength. Invest like crazy in whatever you are passionate about (Mine is real estate). Reinvest those profits. In my investments, it's not too difficult (with lots of planning, education, etc.), to double your investments worth in a few short years, AND still keep cash flowing.	The very first step clean your room this helps you organized, reduce your chances of getting sick, and the environment around you feels better.
You have a girlfriend who made you wait until the 10th date before having sex with you. Midway through your relationship, you find out she has a long history of casual sex and hookups with guys she barely knew. How would you react?	This is the saddest post I’ve ever read in this sub. Has it been brigaded or something? Nobody is entitled to sex with another. Just the use of the term withholding is making me cringe. So many paradoxes and hypocrites here it makes my head spin.	I’d be totally fine with taking it slow & not having sex immediately since that’s what I’d want to do anyway. I wouldn’t want to know about all her hookups & casual sex though tbh
My new puppy or the girlfriend, which one do I choose?	Puppy, puppy always, if my ex wanted to get back and got a puppy I'd love the puppy as well.	1) that mindset, the idea of "them or me" is toxic as hell and will bite you in the ass. 2) you made a commitment to that dog and you should live up to it. the girlfriend you're still deciding on.
My fiancée has entered the third trimester, how do I become the best father to my son?	Be there, don't baby him, and be a masculine role model. Nothing worse than a guy who runs off, doesn't give tough love when it's deserved, and doesn't teach his son that it's okay to be man. Don't take that last line as "toxic masculinity", it's a serious issue. Men are being raised in such a way that they end up withdrawn from the world, not feeling they fit. Teach him to be a man; a man's man.	Don't leave the education of your son entirely up to the education system. Find good books for your son to read. Teach him things that will benefit him in the real world. Provide learning experiences.
Men of Reddit, what makes you respect one girl more than the other?	self respect. I'll get down voted but this also includes the way she's dressed, especially if it's inappropriate for the particular environment.	If I'm chilling with someone I watch how they interact with other people. If they're nice to random peeps my respect for them goes up, if they're rude it goes down.
What are your thoughts on a girlfriend still hanging out with a couple she had threesomes with in the past?	Personally, I would break up w/ her on the spot, but that's me. Getting into a relationship is serious business and I have my criteria (not having an overly active sexual past being one of them). Looking from the outside, If everyone's ok w/ it, I wouldn't look down on it at all. Individual choices vary and affinities too.	My initial reaction? Discomfort - it is not something I've ever dealt with. Since it was an ongoing thing, my first thought is that she may be trying to gently introduce the idea of a swinger-type dynamic.
What's hard about dating you?	I'm never going to live with you. I'm never going to marry you. I'm never having kids. Most of my friends are women, and some of them are attractive. I watch porn. If you feel insecure or jealous, I'll reassure you, but I'm not making ANY changes to my behavior unless it's objectively wrong or causing a real-world problem. I'm going to expect you to adult-up and get over it and if you can't or won't, I will think less of you. I REALLY enjoy being single, so I have no motivation to deal with baggage, hangups, or games. If being with you is a chore, I'll walk away. I bake and cook. A LOT. If you're diabetic, trying to stay skinny, or trying to lose weight, you should stay well clear of me.	I have 'off' periods where I grow distant, need my own space and just don't really feel like talking to you or anyone else, really. It doesn't mean I've lost interest in you, either - it's just that sometimes having my shield emotional invulnerability down for so long in the presence of you drains me. That is a 100% on me and is ridiculous, but I know that in the context of a relationship, this bizarre hot and cold behaviour is maddening enough to want you to walk away and I wouldn't blame you.
Men that made an honest mistake at work that resulted in a co-workers injury or loss of equipment that costs several thousand dollars how did you cope with it?	I fucked up on a simple oil change and we ended up having to use our insurance to buy a new engine. It totally wrecked me. After that I lost all confidence and could barely do my jobs for months. When it got really slow in the winter they let me go, since I was useless anyway. I moved to a different mechanic job but I was so scared of making another mistake my boss fired me 6 months in because I was going to slow and wasn’t making him enough money. He also hated running the shop and sold it shortly after firing me. I haven’t worked as a mechanic since.	I work in stock trading. Mishandled a trade which cost about $36k. Kind of a perfect storm of events... basically just admit your mistake and learn from it. Things happen.
How would you react if someone told you they had a crush on you back in high school?	One woman from school tried that. A group of friends from my HS got together and then some I hadn't seen since then. After she said that, I asked "Why didn't you say anything?" DEER IN HEADLIGHTS. Probably pissed her off but she isn't that good looking and she smokes. The other woman was pretty; she is of Native American descent and has strong, high cheekbones. Met up with some of those same friends on a cabin trip. Had sex with her in a hot tub; not as amazing as people make it out to be. Hooked up and spent time together after that weekend but it didn't work out. Awesome body, good sex and all but she never told me that she did back then.	This happened to me at my 10 year reunion. A girl I went out with a couple times told me how she was surprised I asked her out at all when so many girls were after me. I had no clue what she was talking about, but she listed off 8 or 9 names of girls that she knew has crushes on me at that time. I was popular enough, but I just figured it was because I played sports and tried to be friendly. Turns out that a lot of the drama girls liked me (she was in all the plays/musicals in school) and they gave her shit because they were jealous of her. I didn't believe her at first. I wasn't much of a catch back then, so I don't know what they saw in me.
What's the most shocking thing your wife has wanted to try or do sexually in your relationship?	Not my wife, but had a girl in college who asked if I would submit to being pegged, I noped out of that situation real fast!	Not my wife, but I was making out in the back of my car with this sweet, “innocent” southern girl I had just started dating and out of nowhere she grabs my hand, slaps herself across the face with it, and told me to choke her. I mean I obliged, but that was quite a shock
Honestly, how do you stay strong?	I stay strong by being strong. I've fought a lot of fights in this world. Physical fights, financial fights, metaphorical fights. Homelessness, heartbreak, life-threatening illness, despair, divorce, abusive childhood, whole nine. And I don't even think of it as staying strong. I think of it as staying alive because the alternative sucks. As Dropkick Murphys put it, "You fight for your life because a fighter never quits, you make the most of the hand you're dealt because a quitter never wins." And I'm a religious man. I'm not gonna quit and then try to explain to the gods why I pussed out when it was time to man up. No excuses, no crying, no bullshit. Just like March Madness. Survive and advance.	I seek or accept help when it's offered, and I put my energy into the things that will get me optimal results. Strength isn't about facing the entire world by yourself using only your bare hands, it's about finding out how to get to where you will thrive by any means and any assistance necessary, and putting one foot in front of the other with honesty and courage in order to get there.
What is a male stereotype you think is true for most men?	Most of the stereotypes have a basis in reality, and obviously there are going to be exceptions. So I'd say pretty much all of them?	Stalling medical issues. Pretty much every guy I know needs to be on death's door before they'll see a doctor, myself included, and we have socialised healthcare.
What’s the biggest signal you didn’t pick up on?	I had a girl over for about an hour to "watch the office" but I didn't know if she was 100% into me so I let it go on for a while until she said that she should probably leave. Then I decided "fuck it", made a move, then fucked her. After a decent amount of time where I wasn't sure if she wanted to fuck or not. Good times.	A couple years ago via snapchat convo: --- **Her**: Remember back in high school? You used to throw pennies at me and call me your "penny whore", good times... **Me**: Hahaha yeah, sorry about that, I thought you found it funny **Her**: I did think it was funny! I liked it a lot... **Me**: Oh okay good, I was kinda worried, I was a major douche back then **Her:** It's okay, I can still be your penny whore if you want... **Me:** Eh, probably wouldn't work, pennies aren't legal tender anymore hahaha --- She then proceeded to stop talking to me, met a guy at her university, and they've been together ever since. Still beating my head against the wall for that one.
Why are so many men in this sub so bitter?	Because those who are not angry and bitter wouldn't waste their time on an internet forum. Those of us who are willing to waste our time here are most likely bitter. Want to find happy people? go outside. Want to find miserable people? well, you've already found us. This obviously isn't the case for everyone on here. Some people are way too cheerful. It's disgusting.	Welcome to the internet. It's absolutely common that you find more negative voices about almost any topic, than you find positive ones. It's just a normal phenomenon, that people who are happy about stuff don't usually talk about it, but people who are not want to complain and vent and therefore it seems, that an entire community is like that. There's no other way than simply dealing with it.
What has your partner done that made you laugh your ass off? Or, what have you done that made your partner laugh their ass off?	Came home from work one day, and started to change clothes. My wife happens to be in the bedroom, gives a big happy seductive smile, and starts to quickly tear her clothes off as well. Still smile thinking of it. And the fun part after.	"Tomorrow I'm starting a diet, and doing yoga every day, and..... wasn't this pizza supposed to be a large? It feels like a medium."
What’s the worst thing a girl has called your little curly fry?	My ex had an 8 inch, and I had grown used to that length. Next boyfriend came along with only 6 inches, and I accidentally let "oh wow so-and-so's was 8." That relationship ended quickly	I'm Asian and rock a solid 4.5er. An old partner once said "oh my God it's so big!" and I just looked at her strange, like come on. I know I'm not big at all so why do you gotta say that... Totally killed the mood. My current girlfriend looked at me seriously once, she may have even put her hand on my chest, and said, "You know, when it's soft it is so small but it grows so much! It's surprisingly big!" That one actually made me feel good - but she also said I was the smallest guy she slept with a few days after saying this so..
Men in committed relationships: how often do you get crushes on other people? How do you react?	If you're getting crushes easily, it probably means something is off, could be your partner, the type of relationship or you just aren't ready for commitment. When I'm in love I hardly even notice other girls as potential partners.	There are times when things are particular rough in my current relationship where I'll get flirted with and I'm thinking about the grass being greener. But I know I wouldn't want her to do the same to me, so I go back home and water my own yard. There's no sense in complicating a relationship by pursuing other people.
What was the smoothest move you've ever made on a woman?	So working at a reasturant thats "down on the farm" on a smoke break with a buddy when a cute server walked out and started talking with us. anyway i finish my smoke and start walking back in when i turn and ask her " do you have any knee pads?" She responds " no why?" So i respond "well you better get some cause your gonna need the." We've been together almost ten years celebrating our third wedding anniversary.	I was having a conversation in a club with this really weird and cool chick and she pulls off a tiny unicorn head plushie from her bag. She told me something like "Did you know that if you grab an unicorn's horn you can ask for a wish?" And I was like "Oh for real?" And then I touched the plushie's horn and asked for her number. She laughed and then gave me the digits. That was the only time I asked for the number of a girl and Im a little bit bummed out of probably never being able to top it.
What’s the difference between a woman you’d fuck and a woman you’d wife?	Women want the relationship first, then they decide to have sex. Men want to kick the tires sexually, and then commit. It's a function of what the gender is risking. Cutting down sexual options? Only for someone who's sexually compatible and worth it as a person. Taking the risk of disease and pregnancy? Only for someone who can pay child support and will be a nice guy about it.	Would Fuck: * Seems good in bed. * Looks hot/my type * Is willing Would Wife: * Seems like the kind of person I could be honest with. * Could trust. * Makes me smile/happy. * Cares about me. * Could spend a lot of time with. Of course, it's best to find a woman who fits both categories.
Why does it seem like social anxiety is so common these days?	I venture to say most comments are completely self diagnosed. It's the victim complex. They want something to blame for themselves. I refuse to believe every other redditor is someone who suffers from depression, social anxiety, has a slight case of OCD, while being an introvert, has a narcissist parent, and also suffers from misophonia.	I'd say its a combination of: * exposure to social media creates warped views on what a "fulfilled" life is * the internet gives shy people a place to vent safely * social anxiety related issues are topical and possibly being over-diagnosed * modern society has shed a lot of culture/tradition that provided regularity and purpose; it it's absence a lot of people are feeling lost and without purpose
FAQFriday: What "shallow" traits do you look for in a partner?	i wont date a girl if she isnt turning heads in public. some guys hate that, some love it. I had one redhead i dated with a ridiculous ass and going out to the mall or the movies or wherever and watching the dudes stare at her and then glare at me.....i fucking loved it. im competitive so i feel like i won, and i feel like a celebrity because ill have couples and sweet older people looking at us as well. go out with a hot girl and see how the world changes. its a different game level setting. so yeah, its not even necessarily she needs nice boobs or ass or what have you, but she needs to turn heads. if she doesnt we arent dating, at least not while im still in my 20s.	No fat women and no super skinny women. Physical attraction is very important to me and I don’t find either of those 2 extremes attractive.
Many beards start out poorly, but grow into masterpieces. What are some predictors of a good vs bad beard?	Predictor of a bad beard: Your dad can't grow one. You don't shave for months but never get anything more than scraggley hairs.	Stick with it for at least 6-8 weeks minimum. Mine grows in a little patchy early on and doesn't look fantastic but with time it looks much better and more full
In what ways don't you fit standard dating expectations?	I'm married to my job, I get restless if I stay in any one place longer than a year or two, I never take my phone with me when I go out (or I leave it in airplane mode until I need it to get an Uber) so it's almost impossible to get a hold of me when I don't want to be gotten hold of, and really, unless you actually live in my apartment, you're not going to get much of my time (and if you can't get hold of me much, you're not going to build enough of a connection with me to where moving in together isn't completely insane.)	IMO if the early stage is already a game of who texts or not then the person you are talking to isn’t the one
What's the female equivalent of "being a gentleman" when dating?	A lot of this doesn't sound "gentlemenly" to me, it more sounds patronising or mollycoddling...especially the offering to pay for everything...what year is this? Why are you impressed by a man offering you money? Buy your own dessert :) I think a better conversation is around "kindness"	Being kind, attentive, and not expecting to be treated like a princess from the start. A date shouldn't be the guy doing all the work, especially if he was the one to put himself out there by asking her out first. Being willing to pay for herself, offering date ideas (this can be stressful for a lot of guys), and contributing to conversation are all nice too.
That eternally single friend of yours - what's keeping you from setting them up?	Playing match maker is a huge cultural taboo here. If someone wants to find love they have to do it alone and on their own.	He is a fairly abusive person. He can't see it in himself and doesn't want to go to therapy to resolve his problems. He's unhappy being single which only multiplies his underlying issues while ensuring no woman would come within a hundred feet of him romantically.
Husbands of reddit, what advice would you give a man before he gets married?	Don't pick fights, but also don't concede everything. You need to keep things that are yours and that you like. She'll likely assault all things that you own. Doesn't matter that she has 20 boxes in storage, she'll ask you to reduce your one box of storage and feel justified doing so. Stay firm. Also, tell her sex once a day is your baseline.	"Don't stop dating your wife. " - Chris Rock Just because there's a ring on the finger doesn't mean you stop planning nights out together.
Alrighty, what's the most depressing, single man meal you've made?	I don't understand what being single has to do with it, do coupled men still expect women to cook for them? What year is this?	I was too lazy to do the dishes so I took my box of cereal and gallon of milk. Took a handful of cereal, put it in my mouth, chugged milk. Ate the whole almost new box of cereal in one sitting.
How do I get over my failure in my 20s?	I don't think it's actually you that wants to sleep with lots of women. It's your ego. But you won't believe me. And it's ok, I totally understand that. You won't change your mind just because of my comment. One way to change your mind is to actually fuck those dozens of women and realize that the emptiness inside didn't go away, that you're still not happy. The other way is psychological self-awareness you can achieve by introspection, psychotherapy, getting rid of your ego, meditation and learning about Buddhism. I'm not telling you to become a Tibetan monk. But I encourage you to get into Taoism, Buddhism and Zen. You can start with book "Tao of Pooh" by Benjamin Hoff	You need to find out why not sleeping with a lot of people means being a failure. That's a pretty shitty scale to judge your success on.
What is the most accidentally insulting thing you've ever said to a woman?	I had a roommate once, we had been friends in high school, and years later became room ates... her sister and i lost our virginity to each other back then. One night we were drinking and somehow we got to compliment roommates boobs. My dumbass said "well if your sister had had your boobs, that woulda made our first time perfect" She was so mad after that we didnt drink together again after that... told her sister to stay away from me after that for life lol. i really didnt see the big deal,, still dont.	When I was in high school, I once thought "love handles" was the sexy waist part of an hourglass figure. smdh That didn't end well...
Men of reddit, what made you fall out of love from your SO?	I've been on the wrong end of the breakup the past couple of relationships, and it definitely made me fall out of love. And the one before that, I was never really into the girl, more "she's nuts about me so I'll fuck her on the reg and see if I catch feels." (Narrator: "He didn't catch feels.") Last time I was in love and fell out of love, it was because her social-justice-warrior politics and tendency to shit-talk my friends made me realize it would eventually be them or her, and they were here first (also "bros before hos.")	Realizing that she had zero intentions of being in an equal partnership - when she needed support I was there for her, whatever she needed. When I needed support she shamed me for it, called me childish, said I was trying to get her to mother me.
How important is sex to you in a relationship?	How important is marriage in a relationship....ZERO. WTF dude you are seriously considering entering into a one sided legal agreement and you are only in your mid 20's? Why?	I have respect for people who choose not to have sex until marriage - i think it takes dedication and willpower to achieve that. BUT, i also think it's a bit stupid. Sexual compatibility is a huge part of a relationship in my book, and I'd never marry a girl without knowing what she's made of.
What are some of your favorite traditions you and your SO have?	We take turns disappointing each other, ignoring each other, feeling bad, and making up for it. At least once a month maybe?	Every Halloween we get loaded and watch Nightmare Before Christmas. Every Christmas we get loaded, make lasagna, and watch Muppet Christmas Carol.
When you're hanging out with a female friend, what can you do to make clear that you're NOT a couple?	Can't believe all these dumb comments saying, "why does it matter", "why do you care"? Why does it matter? Because obviously it is a problem if not you wouldn't be asking for advice. Why do you care? Because some awkward and uncomfortable situation can arise from people confusing you for a couple. Besides that, you should't have to explain yourself. If you're asking for advice, then it matters. Saying "who cares" or "what does it matter" is basically like shitting on the OP, as if to say his problems or feelings don't matter. If you don't think it matters, then gtfo this thread.	Are you trying to make sure she knows you're not a couple or that other people know you aren't a couple?
What's something someone has said off hand that crumbled your self-esteem seemingly permanently as an adult?	I remember one of my closest friends called me a "loser" one night and we didnt talk much for a few years after. She blamed me for being too sensitive, which yes I'm a cancer, we're sensitive people. We're friends again now and we're actually suppose to hang but i never quite got over it, and i think it was right there that I learned you can know someone for years but when push comes to shove you better love your own damn self because they probably really don't have your back the way you think/want them to. Edit: guys get off my damn crab shell 🦀🦀 i dont care what you think 95% of yall wear cargo shorts	A coworker once wrote and recorded a song about me. In it he attacked my receding hairline, my looks, and my sexuality.
Why is doing repetitive grind in game for nothing more gratifying than doing repetitive thing in work where you actually earn money?	Because grinding in a game is something that you WANT, whereas the repetitive boring job over and over again is something that you NEED to do.	Games have shortened the loop to minutes or hours, not months and years like real life. The reward loop is much more immediate and predictable in a game.
What's the dumbest thing you've said to a girl just to keep a conversation going because you didn't want it to end?	Where I live, there is a really good coffee chain called Dutch Bros. Its very popular with girls in my area. I have gotten girls to spill their guts and open up just by asking "So, do you like Dutch Bros?" Works every time.	I'm female, but I've had a few guys try to show me things so I wouldn't leave. Ex. all the sweaters they own, all the food in their cupboard, all their climbing gear...they would talk about each item. It was dumb, but also kind of endearing.
I’ve lost a lot of personal motivation in life after after getting into a long term relationship...if this has happened to you, how do you get past this?	Check out Jordan Peterson on YouTube. Greatly inspiring and extremely intelligent. He has a great book (12 Rules for Life). He also created a website (selfauthoring.com) that provides a great format for introspection. You are given a format to explore your past, present and future. It is a lot of writing but in the end, you have a clear understanding of who you want to be and who you don't want to become.	Sounds like your only motivation was to better yourself in order to get a relationship. Not uncommon. Now you need to find a new cause. You completed your goal, it's good to celebrate. But, if you don't continue to be the motivated person they fell in love with, they'll likely lose interest in you since you're no longer that person. So it's time to make new goals. Do you want more friends? A better career? To make more money? Take over the world? Build an iron man suit? Become the best ttrpg player at the Olympics? Sit down, write out a bunch of goals. Work towards them, you now have someone who has your back to help you reach those goals, nothing is out of your grasp.
What tips and tricks did you wish you knew in your early 20s?	Do not put too much effort into pursuing or attempting to build relationships with women. It's an enormous time and energy drain. It's a much better idea to work on improving yourself, if it's in any way connected with work it's also very risk (as is dating) and all in all, it's a much better idea to let women alone.	It took me 5 years to figure out that it doesn't matter if you're right if no one will listen to you. It's just as important to be liked and respected within your group as it is to have good ideas. If nobody wants to work with you or listen to you because of your attitude then you won't accomplish anything. I spent 5 years in the same job before I changed my attitude and started making an effort to engage and make friends with people regardless of their competence or if they appeared to be important. In the next 5 years I was promoted 3 times. I can't help but imagine where i'd be if I wasn't such a punk when I was 25.
What was your experience with women who were bad at sex?	Honestly I would say most women I've met are bad at sex. Maybe my grading curve is skewed from a handful of really good/compatible partners. But most women I've been with seem to think that any sex is good sex in the eyes of a man. With that said my first really bad experience wasn't something she could change. Sex was either painful or uncomfortable for her, she was a trooper but neither of us finished. Tried a lot more foreplay the next time, took it slow. Same results. Told her I was sorry but this wouldn't work for me. There is a huge difference between that and starfish sex.	Had a girl not move and make no noise. She wouldn’t even look at me. She just kept staring at the wall. I feel at this point I do need to mention it was completely consensual and she initiated. After she said she was nervous and it was her first time since her and her husband divorced.
Those who live a healthier lifestyle, what do you bring for lunch to work everyday?	Carrying a lunch bag does not go well with my outfit 🦊 I eat out at lunch. A wrap mostly.	I can’t eat breakfast right when I get up, so I bring a few handfuls of almonds and a banana to have around 9 am at work... makes a big difference and I’m not starving at lunch. For lunch I usually have rice with roasted veggies or veggie curry. I make a big batch and freeze portions. Snack can be another piece of fruit or trail mix. I have a herbal tea every morning with my breakfast at work and coffee maybe twice a week. Key is planning. It’s when you’re caught short and starving you make bad decisions.
(Stolen from r/AskWomen) When did you realize that you were dating an asshole?	When he would make everything about him when I was bringing up a small issue. Then he’d say I was ungrateful and cuss me out and then ghost me. Would come back a week later and pretend like nothing happened. Apologized for saying hurtful things but then kept doing it over and over.	She got pregnant and we hadn't had sex. She tried to guilt me into paying for the child and then blamed me when she ultimately aborted.
Men, what do you hate about dating and what’s the hardest quality to find in a woman?	>What do I hate most about dating? I'm coming to the realization that it's a giant waste of time. A lot of women are not worth the effort. There's a reason why marriage rates keep declining, the juice isn't worth the squeeze. So my current solution is fucking them and discarding them when they overstay their welcome. >Whats the hardest quality to find in a woman? Loyalty.	Basically my standards for a girlfriend went from "does she give me a boner?" To "do I see myself seriously dating and maybe falling in love with this girl?" This has basically made me single for a while because I won't just jump into a relationship for the sex anymore. I think the hardest part of dating at 25 vs high school is that I'm not forced to go to a place and take class everyday with girls around me. I have to go out and find them.
Men, how obvious is it when a woman is sexually attracted to you?	Extremely. Women can't hide arousal to save their lives. I don't understand the whole Reddit trope of "I don't see it". Women are painfully obvious when they're aroused, I just feel a lot of guys don't always like to take the shot unless they're 110% sure.	>I’m talking about unplanned (or even unwanted) yet palpable sexual tension. The kind where you can’t think about anything except ripping their clothes off and doing it where you stand. >Is it more or less noticeable when it’s a reciprocal tension? It is noticeable. However, I notice it about 2-5 years after the incident in question.
What is the quickest amount of time you've went from introducing yourself to having sex? How and what kind of setting? Was your mindset different than usual?	15 months. I met her a party my friend was throwing. Met her again about 14 months later and asked her out. After a few weeks of dating, we had sex. The only other person I've had sex with I was friends with for 3 years before we got in a relationship. I ended up marrying both of them.	About an hour. Met on tinder, explicitly to hook up, the hour was mostly for a couple of drinks and to check nobody was a psychopath. My mindset was... usual I guess? More interesting was probably my mindset after. I didn't really enjoy the experience for some reason - I think the transnational nature of it made it a lot less fun than a one night stand with someone you meet in a club. It might have been my relative sobriety, but it felt a lot more grimy and I've been trying to avoid it ever since. When you meet someone in a bar/club you can have an evening before you get there. There is build up and tension that is then usually satisfyingly (or not) released - rather than a mechanical process.
To what extent is pick up artistry bull crap?	Well its real human psychology they use, they just over sell it on how easy and fool proof it is.	It acts as though women are a computer that you must hack through these amazing tricks, and once you got it down there is little to no failure. The objectification when it comes to tactics is kind of a "one size fits all" mindset. Most of the girls I pick up is just from swallowing my pride, sacking up and just starting a conversation. I'm a fan of reading body language, but the mental gymnastics to employ pickup tactics are generally unnecessary.
Guys who have accidentally knocked out your girflriend/wife, what happened?	Hell with it; I'd say this counts: I thought that it was men who generally pass out immediately after sex, and women tend to get a bit buzzed. But one of my exes would be out cold after O #4 or 5. She'd tap out and then be snoring like 3 minutes later, sometimes even mid-sentence.	One of my first girlfriends came into the bathroom while i was taking a shower and started throwing cold water over me. So i take the shower head and start to soak her with it, as she turns around to run she ran straight into the edge of the door and knocked herself out cold. She had a huge lump on her head and i was scared all her family would think i'd hit her.
What subreddits have you been banned from?	r/movies for (correctly) arguing that the Disney Star Wars films are nothing but corporate cash cows r/StarWars for (correctly) arguing that the new characters are badly written and only exist to spout SJW talking points r/Battlefield and r/masseffect for arguing that EA's recent pivot to SJW has gutted both of these franchises r/TopMindsOfReddit because they just automatically ban people based on whatever. r/politics for having the audacity to support the Don and not sucking the dick of the Demoncrats r/AskReddit for calling someone a cuck (guess I deserved that one)	R/whatisthisthing because I suggested that something may be a ramp for people in wheelchairs. The mods thought it was a “mean joke” which made me sad because I was being totally genuine and thought it could be helpful for OP.
Why did Rory end up with Logan when Jess was clearly the best option for her?	Rory ended up with Amy. Kind of necessary for the sake of the universe, since Melody had to be born, yadda yadda. Logan... Well, I havne't seen the movie. I thought Nick and Jess got together? Haven't seen New Girl.	I hate that I know what this means but all I care about is that Kirk is happy and successful doing whatever grand plan he comes up with.
Inspired by AskWomen: What qualities/actions stand out most to you in women?	Athleticism. It shows they care about their body and are strong mentally. And most athletic women I’ve found aren’t that into drama, so that’s always a good thing	Not sure what to all this, but it's something like 'good-heartedness'. It's the little things like recycling, picking up pieces of litter, holding the door open for someone with children, being a passive driver, not getting impatient with cashiers and other service employees, thanking people often, not letting one rude asshole ruin her mood, etc. You can't really quantify it. You won't find it in a dating profile. But when you see it, you notice it. And it's wonderful.
Men, what is weighing on your mind today that you'd like to get off your chest?	I fell in love with this girl a few years ago, hard. I've never felt stronger about someone. She didn't feel the same so after a year she broke things off. For a year now I've been using girls that I have no interest in to try and feel the way I did with her. I've ruined a ton of girls lives and i don't know if I'll be able to stop.	I’m sexually deprived, and lonely but I also hate one night stands, or rushing into a relationship. I also dislike prostitution, so that sucks. Besides that shits pretty good.
If you married your first crush how would your life have turned out?	Not good. Was a theatre girl, came from a wealthy family (new BMW when she turned 16)...went to a Disney theme park/cruise or other related Disney trip *at least* twice a year... * Despite graduating high school a virgin, went off to college, joined a sorority and slept with half of the Lacrosse team * Dyes her hair like every other month * Became an uber feminist/tumblrina, not necessarily politically, but in the cliche consumerist sense. * Still a rich daddy's girl But still really attractive :(	Well she ended up studying the same thing as me. Seems we still share common interests etc plus she turned out really beautiful. Personality wise who knows, but it may have gone well. But I'm happy it didn't, I have an amazing girlfriend now
Men, how do you deal with the possibility you might be single forever?	Dude, lots of chicks into older men. Trust me if you take care of yourself you're gonna have it good up until like 35 years old. I see it all around me. Girls under 25 years old fall for older guys so fast. There's like the stereotype that older guys are more smooth and experienced. Your best is still ahead of you man	I’m in my 30s, still single, cant seem to find anyone to even go on dates with me. I deal with the inevitability of me being forever single by keeping myself busy. I have a motorcycle, I travel, I play video games, I go to concerts and festivals.
What’s up with nudes?	It’s for the guys seeing picking up women as a game to make you feel better than your competitors Or just something great in a relationship	Can't say I've gotten any nudes in a long time. I'd have to assume because it's much more personal when someone sends *you* nudes. More so than just finding them on the internet
What do you think would happen to the dating landscape if the average guy put as much effort into his appearance as the average girl?	Idk man ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯, I think the 1-2 hours I spend 5 times a week squatting, deadlifting, pressing and rowing along with a caloric deficit is a lot more effort than shaving legs and putting on makeup. The rest are the same. Maybe women take more time to do their hair but we also have to deal with our facial hair. Edit: Many women are quite pathetic going all downvote and validate me because it’s so hard to put on make up, follow some regime and not eating like a pig. Please if a 2M tall man can workout, go to work and eat <2k kCals/day you too can eat < 2k kCals. Much hard work, very strong womyn. Please...	I think the average guy would, if he knew what would work and was confident it wouldn't make him look stupid. When I was single I knew I had a very boring way of dressing and no particular sense of style. Every time I'd see a guy who dressed flashier or whatever I'd think to myself "yeah but if I do that I'll look like I'm pretending," or "does he look good or does everyone just think he's a douchebag?". I did, however, put tremendous effort into what I *thought* women wanted. Some of it was a waste, some of it wasn't wrong. Mostly fitness and getting good enough at stuff to hopefully be attractive if anyone saw me doing it.
How often have you encountered a woman who was selfish or boring in bed?	Upper 20's here. I can't bang a sandbag unless I'm really thirsty and need to get one out. That's what constitutes as boring to me. If the girl is just sexing to sex, good for her. Not enough for me anymore. In respect to the above statement, I'm absolutely done with shy girls. I often took the initiative on reserved girls expecting a sexually discerning, but repressed mindset eager to unleash some pent up energy. ( that's why I was shy, at first) Too many of them are in fact, human fleshlights with no idea how to navigate the sexual experience. Worse, lacking the courage to even try to be sexually empowered. Even the tightest of the bunch isn't worth wading through their social ineptitude. It sucks putting in the work, successfully getting laid, only to feel like you didn't get any at all.	50/50. One was a complete starfish, laid on her back and told me : "Make me cum". I was just finished telling her I was a virgin, but apparently, men have received a complete handbook on life since age 15 so I've should have known. Another one could only do missionary, did not want to try anything else. Boring as hell.
What was the biggest hit to your self esteem you ever took?	rejected by an ugly nerd in public. Later on in the year saw her dating a dude that was taller and fitter than me. Infuriated me to no end and from that day on I realized that everyone would be happier if they were forced with their looksmatch.	When I was in highschool many of the girls dated guys that were in their 20s. I had a huge crush on this girl and we were both 16. Eventually I found out her boyfriend was 22 and I felt like I wasn't shit. How the hell was I supposed to compete with a 22 year old that has his own car and apartment??!?
How did you handle realizing you may not like your parents for who they are?	Don't judge other people like that. Like what you like about them, and dislike what you dislike about them. That's how you should deal with most of the people in your life. If what they're doing is affecting you negatively, take reasonable and respectful steps to assert yourself. Otherwise, accept it and instead go focus on improving yourself; you can't improve other people.	I told myself that loving someone doesn't necessarily mean I have to like them. I live far away and talk maybe once every 2 weeks. It's all superficial stuff nothing too deep. I have no interest in being friends with them .
What is your passive income stream?	I make dog birthday cakes. Well, I've made *one* dog birthday cake. It's fun. After materials I profit a whopping $25-$50 dollars, depending on the concept of the cake. I also make menu plans. I only have 2 customers, but they pay me about $50 for a general plan. It's time consuming because I have to get a lot of health history and I do it all VIA e-mail. If they want to meet in person they can, but people seem to not have time for that, so if they fib about their height, weight, measurements, activity level, etc. my plans aren't always effective. Then they need to you know, actually follow through with them.	I make apps and put ads in them. I make about $5/year from that. I'm a (not very good) photographer. I've submitted some photos to stock websites. I've made about $2 so far. Rakin' in the dough.
Experienced men of reddit. What are some things about women you've seen that an inexperienced person is unlikely to believe?	Lots more girls have a cnc fantasy than you would think. I bet it's at 30 percent. # Edit: it's rape role play. You guys need to get out more.	Some women can think very highly of their own looks and sex appeal while also having terrible self esteem about everything else. I've spoken to more than a few women who knew they were very attractive but feel otherwise worthless and don't like themselves much. It's really sad.
What career certifications helped you the most and how difficult are they to attain?	Confidence. I know that isn’t the technical cert you were looking for but it has been the stamp of approval for so many things for me. I got my current job almost entirely on the back of being confident that I could do it and portraying that.	In IT. Really any technical certification that is general and in your field will set you apart from the competition. Anyone can say they have Vmware/Azure/AWS experience, but if you have certifications your resume will stand out. Also certifications generally command a 10-20% higher salary than non-certified professionals.
How much sex would be too much for you?	Not sure as I haven't found a partner with a higher libido. But mine have been on the decline so I doubt I can go back to at least 3x a day back in college. So let's say 3 - 4x a day.	> How much would be too much for you personally? Really couldn't know until we reached the point where the spirit was willing but the flesh is spongy and bruised. I know that I've never come close to my limit in the long term, only ever on specific days where we had especially long marathon sex.
Why would men think of women who approach us first as "desperate"?	Woman here, that had to give my two cents. I approached my bf. We were on a dating site and I knew what I was looking for... No time for others. My profile was hidden, only those who I contacted could view it. He said that he was surprised and pleased. He totally understood my reasons and respected that I know what I want, go after it and don't play games. We're mid thirties and tired of the bullshit that seems to go hand in hand with most relationships.	I would love to be approached by a woman and would look very positively once I figured out she was not selling anything.
What thing does your wife/girl friend hate about her body that you find attractive? What do you hate about your body that she finds attractive?	Something that I have always been captivated about my ex-girlfriends and women in general, was that hair. That long, flowing, thick, cascading hair. Gorgeous.	My wife has the most beautiful smile but when anyone takes a photo of her she smiles with her mouth closed. I've told her repeatedly but she doesn't believe me. As for me, I think I look like a troll but my wife doesn't seem to agree.
Single Men of Reddit. What are some fun &amp; exciting things to do alone?	There's no activity that can get you where you want. It's a philosophical change you need. I would ask you this. Look at how your parents behaved together and look at if there were any childhood things that happened that kept you from learning how to connect. Activities are great and all but it's a mask. I actually saw this awhile ago and while i dont really od the PUA thing I enjoyed the 4 points of higher value which I always felt was true	I play a lot of hockey. I work out a lot. Video games are great. I spend a lot of time in the kitchen. I'm learning bicycle mechanics. Netflix is fun. I'm learning to homebrew.
How do I hold myself accountable and make myself get off my ass and do what I need?	I’m the same way. I just sit around until one day I feel like doing it and I get it done. I do this with every single thing	Stop viewing decisions as choosing what to do, and start viewing them as choosing who to be. When the alarm goes for the gym and your hand is hovering over the snooze button, don't ask yourself if you want to sleep for another ten minutes. Ask yourself if you want to be the kind of person who is lazy and doesn't follow through on commitments. I can't guarantee it will work 100% of the time, but it will be a lot more effective. And once you start living a life that is consistent with your personal values, your self esteem will rocket upwards.
Why don't female performers and artists get groupies to the same extent as male performers/artists?	Look at who those Females date normally. Hypergamy comes into place and the woman want other 1% men. You would have to be something/someone special for the Star to even LOOK your way.	If your definition of groupie is a fan that's willing to have a ONS with the artist then I'd say there are more male groupies but you don't notice them because it's the norm. I don't think there are many (single)men (fan or not) who would refuse to have a ONS with Beyoncé for example. But if they were were as open about it as female groupies they'd all be labeled perverts, stalkers, ...
How do you know your dad could kick my dad’s ass?	Can women play? My dad was a counter-intelligence operative for the US Army. Your dad's ass could already be kicked *and you wouldn't even know it*.	My dad has a twin, so while your dad is sizing up my dad, another my dad would run in from the side and take him out velociraptor-style.
Do guys ever think "That girl is too much for me?" If yes, how so and why?	Those men are wankers. For the right one, you will be perfect. But if you truly want to change yourself, do it because of how you feel, not because some guy told you.	For me, girls that were “too much” were the ones that lived for drama and went in ridiculous moods or held grudges over the silliest things, that was too much
How do you find a girl that shares similar values/belief/maturity?	You don't. It's literally something you ingrain in your partner. Now before anyone jumps down my throat, I don't mean in some tyrannical kind of way. In terms of pair bonding women will follow in the footsteps of their men in most cases. Instinctively most women tend to gravitate to men who are exude mental and physical strength. These women will adopt the man's values and beliefs as if they were there own. There is no magic unicorn in the dating scene unfortunately for men. You will need to work on the women you're with.	Your dating pool is college kids, so... yeah. I can see why you don't have much in common with them, given your experience. You need to fish in a different pond. Are there any groups for young vets like yourself? Or for any hobbies that you might have?
What would you do if a girl tried to buy you a drink?	View her with immediate suspicion. She has an agenda. Women don't buy drinks. Women don't buy anything if they can avoid it, they get a man to buy it for them.	Tell her that she doesn't need to roofie me to get into my pants but drink the whole thing anyways.
What's the worst decision you ever made that, despite all odds, turned out wonderfully?	While this is a very very bad thing to do, I am frequently skeptical about "doctor's orders", and it usually works. My doctor would tell me not to touch my sprained foot, I would pull it so hard that something cracks and I'm mobile again. My doctor would tell me to not touch my ear during the infection, I manage to "clear the path" for medication to enter my ear by touching all around it.	Turned up for a job interview in a tracksuit. It was for a job as a sports teacher, so I thought it would be appropriate... until I saw that every single one of the other 12 applicants were wearing a full suit. Well, I must've done something right, because they offered me the job on the spot! When I later asked about the interview, they said I seemed to be much more laid back than the other applicants and thought I'd fit well into the department.
Your girl posts your personal relationship problems on social media. What do you do?	I post question on reddit to discuss said personal relationship problems about my girls posting personal relationship problems on social media, of course.	That's a big no no for me. Social media isn't an excuse to air private matters out to the world. I think it is fair to have a conversation with her explaining that social media is not to be used to share intimate details, relationship problems, or seek advice on such things. If she wants to talk about relationship issues with someone else, she can pick up the phone and call her best friend. If she continues to do so, you won't ever feel safe confiding in her or sharing personal details. That's pretty much terminal to a relationship.
How do you start seeing yourself as a sexual being (and getting others to see you as such)?	This only applies if you're 18+. Save up, get a hooker, understand that sex is a transaction. Unfortunately you're on the heavy supply side with little demand. Now, if you're smart or good looking you can get it for free. The basics are: Look good, smell good. Be attractive, don't be unattractive. Manscape your crotch. Follow the three date rule unless you don't live in a major metropolitan area and "don't stick your dick in crazy". You've probably never loved or been loved so just remember, women hate that. Don't tell anyone you're a virgin. Fucking is like riding a bike: It takes time to learn, uses rubber, and you might hurt yourself a bit. Godspeed OP.	Are you a virgin? I honestly didn't start to think of myself as a 'sexual being' until I actually had sex for the first time (and then a few more times after that, since the first time was terrible). It took a woman actively wanting me to have sex with her for it sort of really click with me on a subconscious level that 'holy shit, there are women out there who want me to fuck them'.
What is a completely mundane thing you have very strong opinions about?	Crunchy, NOT creamy!!!!! If you give me a PB&J with f*cking creamy peanut butter, I will stare you down as throw it at the wall hard enough to make it stick.	People with selfies as their phone background, and post quotes on their social media to act as if they're enlightened piss me off.
How do your friendships with your girl friends differ from with your guy friends?	Female friends are women that I want to sleep with or have friends that I want to sleep with. Once I got married my wife replaced every woman out there. You can downvote all you want. But, I never had a female friend that I wouldn't have slept with if she was interested. My wife was an old room mate and best friend of an ex. Basically I was friends with her for years. Then she showed interest and I married her.	Maintaining boundaries is more important with women, lest I accidentally convey romantic interest. I can be more relaxed with men.
guys, what makes you insecure while dating?	Whether the girl I'm dating is cool about me having a wife. Before you bring out the pitchforks, its a joke.	I'm not used to thinking of myself as desirable, so it would take me quite a while to really accept that a partner is into me. The great length of time I've gone without managing to get a single date only reinforces that insecurity.
College Dropouts, how are you doing now?	I’m not a man, but I’ll write about two men in my life. One of them was a hard partier and had LOTS of friends. Some of them were in university and when they graduated he hit a spiral because their lives went in a different direction. His family rallied. He pulled himself together and now, even without a degree, he is financially independent, living in an expensive city, has a flourishing social life and is building his future. He’s very smart and resourceful so that helps immensely. The other man is my husband. He’s the kinda guy who has to always have a full-time job so he did university part-time in his twenties and thirties. He’s a manager and he needs to have a degree in his field. Doing his degree part-time was hard but worth it.	Watch out for survivor bias here. A lot of college dropouts who are likely not doing so great won't be commenting.
What can a woman do to make herself more attractive to you?	Don’t use too much makeup. A tiny bit is attractive but I’ve always found too much make up is artificial	In all honesty, some physical attraction is necessary, but what qualifies as attractive is largely subjective. If you put any small level of thought and preparation into your appearance, you'll be fine. I'll ask you out the first time based on appearance. If you're 6/10 on my personal scale, I want to go on a date with you. What will keep me coming back, though, is personality. Are you fun? Do you seem to be a well-rounded person? Do we have interests in common? Don't worry about going over the top with hair/makeup/etc. If you can be a confident and fun partner, you'll be incredibly attractive to everyone.
What's the worst heartbreak you've suffered, and did you get through it?	Dated a lady for six-ish months before she ended up getting engaged to another dude. (their married now) Never felt more betrayed in my life. I’m still working on getting back on my feet. Baby steps I guess.	I’ve had a few heartbreaks. And each one helped me realise if I can get over one, I can get over another The thing about heartbreak is that we long for the GOOD feelings we experienced, the GOOD times. Which is why I consciously remind myself of the BAD times, the BAD feelings I experienced, even writing a list pf them and looking at them over again. Every time that longing happens, I remind myself of the fuckery that I hated (which is ultimately why it didn’t work out). Soon enough my nostalgic memories are more complete. The good and bad of it all. I create a healthy distaste for those times, no longer long for them, soon enough it just becomes something that happened in my life. It **will** take time. But this technique speeds up the process greatly.
What was a girl's worst reaction to you trying to kiss her?	Well she screamed "who the fuck are you? How did you get to my gouse" and started trying to untie ber arms.	I leant in to kiss a girl and she poked me in the eye. It was devastating. I had to go to the eye hospital.
Did you ever feel honestly desired? If yes what made you feel so?	Money, looks, and personality get you laid. In that order. Women desire what you can do for them. Don't fill your head with romantic nonsense.	Having a hot tinder girl message me for a booty call was an ego boost and a half Didnt go though cos it was 3:30 am and my phone pinging woke me up before work the next day
What is the deal with the impulse to give a house tour before you have sex with someone?	Where all the guys British? I was thinking that would be something you saw in the UK &#x200B; ha ha ha America Hell Ya! Get in the back of my pick-up truck lady!	I can already hear David Attenborough's voice *The male, having successfully brought a female into it's den, attempts to dazzle her with its ornaments and splendor. This being one of the more attractive females means his habitat will have to be that much more impressive. Her gaze wanders and subtly scans his living quarters... she's looking for dirt or anything amiss. The male is not aware of this, and tries to distract her with his autographed Reel Big Fish poster from 1999, carefully and intentionally placed above his bed. The female is not impressed.*
What are some healthy ways to feel and be more masculine?	A friend once told me something that I'll always keep in mind. "You are a man, anything you do is manly!" and it's true. Whatever you do just give it 100% and it will be manly, even if you want to be a pedicurist or ballerina, it is still manly!	* Build a campfire and prod it with a stick (you don't need to know why, just do it). * Open a tough to open jar, bonus points if it was handed to you by a woman who couldn't open it * Lift heavy stuff * Grunt
Men, I just found out I can no longer drive alcohol due to health reasons. What can I order at the bar other than water and soda?	Get new hobbies dude. "Oh, but muh friends". Drinking buddies are not friends. They're alcoholics who don't go to meetings.	Virgin anything. Bloody Mary (or Caesars for my Canadian homies) aren’t gonna really lack without the vodka. Other cocktails can be made virgin as well. But as far as bang for your buck goes, you might as well stick to water, because virgin cocktails are gonna cost more than they’re worth.
What's your wildest online purchase you've made while inebriated?	I once tried to order a $1 Billion dollar bill from Zimbabwe for like $12 USD but fell asleep and when I looked at my cart the next day I realized I almost accidently ordered 1 Billion $1 Bills.	At 2AM I was browsing Amazon and adding things to my wish list. Turns out I was adding them to 1-click ordering. A few days later my 7 year-old told me UPS was at the door with a trailer. They had a hand truck that included a professional quality dehydrator, speakers, salad dressings, facial scrub, and the list does on. I didn't want to admit to my significant other that I had no idea what was happening so now I'm in the jerky business, and she secretly adds things to my wish list.
My friend can't seem to get a girl and he seems to be slowly becoming depressed over it. What can I do to help him?	Get him to a gym, dress him in decent well-fitted clothes, take the best pictures you can (stage activities if necessary), help him write a witty profile, and get that dude on tinder. Unless you're in a small town or he has unrealistic standards this should work. r/tinder is a gold mine of ideas and recommendations. Get him some books on communication, sales/business stuff, self-help, and dating all have something to offer; you need to sell yourself, you need a healthy self-image, and learning about women doesn't hurt either. Most importantly try to help him internalize that his value as a man isn't tied to his ability to date. Women will come and go many times in most men's lives.	I gave up. I stopped doing things to impress others and started doing things for myself. Concerts, going out on the town, whatever, but by myself. You get used to it. You can’t force anyone to like you, either they do or they don’t.
When did you realise Reddit wasn't the place you wanted to be getting life advice from?	The moment I discovered how popular the belief that it really doesn't matter if your future wife was the town bike is on here.	once you start making your own actual experiences, it's pretty easy to realize that reddit is a super mixed bag. people love to give their opinions. few opinions are worthy of taking seriously. also, we're individuals and our individual situations have a million details that make them unique. there's usually no really easy and universal answers to really hard questions. I use reddit to get some impulses or stimuli, to see whether I might have forgotten to try to see something from a certain perspective. I also "met" some cool and helpful people.
Where is it okay to ask out a woman, other than the bar?	if youre average looking and with good style and grooming. anywhere really. but this takes practice and lots of confidence. on top of this ,if youre also a naturally introverted guy like me, then its going to be difficult. feel free to pm me if interested to talk more about this.	Anywhere but context matters. For instance, striking up a conversation with someone on the street and at the end of the conversation asking if she’d want to meet up for coffee is different than yelling “will you go out with me” to a woman that’s walking by. It’s just a matter of paying attention to the context. If someone’s appears busy going about their day, interrupting them with the intention of asking them out may not work out too well. If someone’s at place where people go to socialize, you’re probably okay striking up a conversation with them and then seeing how things go
What are some compliments that you have received or given that are unforgettable?	“When I get to that, I want you to be the father of my child” What was so awesome about this, was that my friend who said this to me is a lesbian. To be chosen as a father by someone you are in a romantic relationship with is great - but being chosen without the “filter” of romantic love and purely by “objective” human evaluation is the best compliment I’ve ever had.	“I’m pretty sure that you might be partly a genius” - boss. I’m absolutely not a genius. I changed careers to something completely different. I have no qualifications, I fell into the interview accidentally (they actually offered me the role above what I applied for based on interview alone) and I’m always terrified that I actually don’t know what I’m doing and making a huge mess of it. But I’m determined to do it right, so I fuckin’ threw myself at it and really pushed myself to make it work. It’s stressful and tiring and draining but I really enjoy it. I know he was blowing smoke because he immediately asked me to Do a Thing, but it was a nice moment of vindication for me.
Does it occur to you that many men seem to be terrified of living ordinary, average but comfortable lives? If so, why do you think that is?	I am not terrified of an ordinary, average life.... I am terrified of how quickly it can be taken away from me. &#x200B; Wife Divorces me Co-worker makes an accusation falsely accused &#x200B; Being male in today's world of "you are guilty until proven innocent" if you are male. &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B;	For me, at least, I think it’s kinda comforting having a normal life. This is also coming from someone who truly loves the people around him. I think that’s what makes it worth it? Like yeah, I wake up and sit at a desk like everybody else, but I have a normal functioning body, a good place to live, a great family and girlfriend. Shit man I like this. Now if I had an overly stressful job, or depression, or a bad family then yeah. I can see how that would suck. But I never found something in my life that made me want to throw it all away and chase that one thing. I’m comfortable and love the people around me, and idk I think that’s a life worth living
How have you been fortunate in life?	My dad work expat. I look after the house for him, but in reality I live there rent free and just cover running costs.	My parents were 1st generation immigrants. My mother, at one point, literally lived in the jungle and my dad grew up in a European orphanage. I was able to get a good education, and an interesting career partly from the values they instilled in me. My wife is beautiful, and came with ... financial benefits (there's no way around it, it has added to my quality of life). We are financially stable, with my only debt being an investment property I bought before getting married. We have a beautiful 2 year old girl, who randomly hugs me and tells me she loves me. We are contemplating a second. I'm living in a goddamned dream and I don't want to wake up.
When you haven't had sex for a while, does horniness/sexual desire eventually dissipate or does it keep growing?	There's seems to be a cut off point around 3 months. When it exceeds three months, it's like my body admits defeat and just goes like "welp, we tried but this bitch is striking out so let's put our feet up."	I'm currently in my longest drought since before losing my virginity. Generally it's fine, but every 4-6 weeks I get in a horny mood that's hard to shake. Lasts a couple days to a week, then I feel fine again. As the time has gone on it's gotten easier to manage, because I expect it and know it'll pass.
I woke up to my roommate standing in my room, he’s male. What do?	Second that sleeping beauty comment. Wear a man thong with elephant trunk. 🐘 Or he could be a gay vampire a la twilight Ed ogling sleeping Bella (you)	Start by asking him. If you don’t like what you hear, consider getting a lock on your door. That is pretty weird...
Men who were in a seemingly perfect never ending relationship, what caused it to end?	I’ve never heard of a 20 year old refer to their girlfriend as a partner. You’re not even done with school yet. What do you need a study buddy or someone to split the mortgage with? You don’t need to break up with your girlfriend to be a man but it probably will happen and I only say that because of your age. So don’t go betting everything in being with her forever, wait on kids, marriage, home ownership, etc. Try out an apartment and a houseplant and maybe a shared cable bill. Then you’ve got a partner and you can evaluate her performance from there.	Never stop pursuing her, even after you get married. If she's important to you, make her a priority. Otherwise something will take her place and she will notice. and vice versa. Communication is key.
How do you cope with being "just another guy" in the modern dating scene?	Why be "just another guy" when you can be the most incredible man she's ever met? Don't put yourself down before you've even started.	You're just another guy, but she's also just another girl. Also, as someone who seriously dates multiple people, I think it's pretty shitty that she wasn't open about that with you. I don't think that's necessarily the norm, and I wouldn't accept that behavior from a potential partner.
How do you stay interesting as an adult?	Drop the video games. Nobody ever gets to the end of their lives and says, "I wish I had played more video games." Travel, volunteer, get outside, find an activity you enjoy and dive into it, join a club, learn an instrument, learn a language, take a course, learn a new skill. Get out there and live life. It's an amazing thing.	One of the best things of getting older is that you run out of fucks to give about whether other people will find you interesting or not. As long as *you're* not bored with whatever it is you're doing - it's really kind of irrelevant how other people feel about it.
How many of you would date a single mom and how many would not?	30+ m here. No way in the world I would date a single mom beyond a fuck buddy. Being a single mom indicates you are generally a very, very, very poor decision maker and engaged in reckless behavior. I'm not going to be beta bucks for someone else's kid. I don't need the drama with an ex, custody, visitation, etc.. The relationship question you need to ask is why would any guy want to date a single mom? What's in it for a guy? What advantages are there with a single mom over a younger, child free single women You may not want to have kids, but I might, as in one of my own with my DNA. Everything isn't about you.	I'm 40. I would not date a single mother again. Essentially helped raise a kid for 4 years and then the mother and I broke up. I was more heartbroken over the loss of the daughter than I was the mother. I still think about her everyday.
Men who married women who wore sweatpants with ‘Juicy’ on their ass, how did your marriage end up?	My (22M) girlfriend (21F) of 6 years, now fiance, wore the whole "Juicy" suits in high school. Her friends would coordinate when they would all wear the suits. We went to high school in the richest county in Northern America, so that explains that. Ever since we have given our lives to Christ and she has become an incredibly generous and compassionate soul- we frequently go on local and international mission trips to love those who need it! She has grown away, as have I, from the lifestyle we lived in high school towards a much more generous one, as modeled to us by Jesus Himself! Getting married in Jan. 2020, can't wait.	I didn't know my wife wore these in middle school till this post. Thank you for the very enlightening anniversary.
I can count on not even 2 hands how many times my boyfriend of 2 years has gone down on me. I'm super duper shy when it comes to sex stuff, idk how to ask these things. How do I properly ask my boyfriend to go down on me without getting rejected/embarassed?	Sometimes in sex you won’t get everything, I know it sucks, but that is life. My wife does not offer good sex to me. I never worried about it.	Get him on his back, go down on him and then just swing yourself around and over his face. A little 69 to start. Or just ask him to.
What’s a fact that you just can’t wrap your head around/accept?	The fact that people STILL think that Apple is still a viable option for technology, whether it be smartphones or laptops, I can't understand why people think that they make good products. There is not ONE thing that Apple does better than say... Samsung. This means that the only reason people are buying Apple products is because they're uneducated. Sure, personal preference is a thing, but are you really going to give up _much_ better performance, value, features, pricepoints, and true innovation for a change in how your home screen looks? Don't even bring up benchmark scores... everyone knows that those numbers don't correlate whatsoever to every day usage. It's been *proven*.	That Jupiter isn't just the largest object in our solar system, save for the sun. Jupiter is more massive than *every single other object* in our solar system *combined*, save for the sun. Also, that it has a single ancient storm so large it could swallow our entire planet three times over with room to spare. The size of Earth is hard enough to grasp. The size of Jupiter is mind-shredding.
how do I come across more interesting to girls?	Ite my g this what you gotta know.. you can't be life of the party if yo gotta get your fragile ass comfortable so start by dropping that ego it's just gassing your ass up. Now you gotta do you my g. That's how it is?	Learn to not be ashamed of sharing your interests. If someone asks "So what do you do for fun?" And you're embarrassed to answer, nothing you say is going to sound intetesting. Be proud of what you like, and that confidence will come through in your words. And be excited! A dull topic can be made interesting when presented by someone who's excited about it. This doesn't apply to every hobby though. Stating that you enjoy skinning squirrels with a confident smile will just make you look like a lunatic.
What's the weirdest social interaction you've ever been part of?	I often encounter other humans who are quite convinced that something magical lives inside them. We spend a lot of energy protecting this magical thing for events we think will happen when the time comes for worms to start burrowing through our bones and brains. Or some human beans believe in this invisible magical creature composed of words they call a self and let such words lock them into unpleasant places. Human beings writing stories for themselves and others, creating wounds and walls for one another all because the words they heard and have to tell. Some humans love words so much, they go and kill other humans (any human, big, small, withadick or without) because some words they like more than they like other people being not dead.	I walked into the reception of a doctors surgery, signed in then sat down and waited. There was one other person there, a middle aged woman who obviously had some kind of learning disability because she was reading a Peppa Pig book out loud to herself. I very skinny woman walks out of the surgery and sits in the waiting area, 2 seats from the woman reading. The reading woman (RW) turns to the skinny woman (SW) and this was the conversation: RW: Hi what’s your name? SW: Louise RW: oh Louise that’s my mother’s name! SW: oh that’s nice RW: Do you smoke crack? SW: Yeah. RW: Oh. And that’s when I got called into the surgery and I never saw either of them again
Married men of Reddit, what are some things that you are glad you don’t have to deal with from your wife/husband that others seem to have to?	I'm glad my husband doesn't have an issue with me being very close friends with other men and hanging out with them one-on-one. I'm friendly and attractive, so I make friends easily. I couldn't have a husband who was controlling in that way, but I see some of my peers dealing with this with their SO's and it's a nightmare, imo.	I'm really glad I'm not dealing with a dead bedroom after 10 years of marriage and 2 kids like so many guys seem to be.
Girlfriend(18?F) lied about her age. What would you have done?	I think you overreacted, massively. Ok, sulk for a while and be mad for a bit, but Jesus. Tune down the hysteria a notch.	I’m a girl and I think that you did the right thing dumping her. If she’s lying about something so insignificant like age so that she doesn’t seem immature (even though 17 and 18 really isn’t much different), she probably is deep down immature and could lie about other things.
Fathers of Reddit. What Cool Stuff can i show my 4 year old son?	Girl here, but very much raised a tomboy. My dad used to take me to this model train store. I know they're independent small businesses, there may not be one where you live. But damn they blew my mind. I would stay for hours and admire them. We built one together at home.	From an old guy, It depends on what your child likes but for me, We built awesome Lego structures together. We made potions (food coloring+ baking soda + vinegar was a favorite) went on adventures/hikes. My oldest wasn't into sports or cars so I had to adjust my interests to fit his. It isn't about showing him things it's about spending time with him and teaching him through your actions to be a good person. They are always watching and learning from you. Remember that when you are in a situation where your son is present. Great job for trying to be the best dad you can.
Be honest - if you are, what's the REAL reason you're still friends with your ex?	This isnt possible if the relationship was healthy and you genuinely had feelings for each other....if they're friends someone in the relationship was being used, or both were using each other.	Girlfriend and I in college were each other's first everything. We have long moved on with other partners and live in different parts of the country. She initiated contact a few years ago and we connect every six or eight months. What's the real reason? Hard to say.Maybe a link to when life was much simpler?
Dear men of reddit, how old were you when you realized that you are, in fact, allowed to show emotions every once in a while? Also, how if you don’t mind me asking?	I think the whole idea that "men aren't allowed to show emotions" is a meme at this point. Men have always shown emotions; in ancient times it was considered a sign of passion (and masculinity!) for a man to shed tears. So I guess to answer your question: I have never *not* known that I could express my emotions. I just... don't sit there and talk about them incessantly because when I have negative feelings, I could be *doing* something to remedy the situation/beliefs causing them.	I actually went the opposite direction. Was raised to show emotions.... Then as girl after girl cheated on me, the openness of feelings and emotions was slowly eroded from my personality. Me and my lady both just insult eachother and laugh and flip the bird constantly and go to rock concerts every chance we get. Turned out ok so far, with occasional bumps in the road.
At the hospital with my wife who is about to go into labor. She’s been reading books and talking to other mothers for months to prepare, but I figured y’all could help me knock it out this morning. So dads, what do I expect when I’m expecting?	They’ll say not to do it, but bring some granola bars for her to snack on and she’ll love ya for it. I’m not saying let her eat her fill! Just have them to curb the tide	I have 2 kids, both over 10lbs born naturally. She's going to say some shit to you. Some things that will hurt, some things that you will struggle not to laugh at. When the baby is out, she won't remember much of it and all will be well in your relationship. During the birth of our second one, she told me she was going to save the placenta and cook it up with my balls for a dinner to celebrate our divorce. After she swore she never said it. That was 18 years ago. I still slightly worry about it when she gets pissed.
Married Men of Reddit, How do deal with morning wood while in bed with your wife/husband?	I just slide it inside of her. Edit: for those of you down voting, I know you're thinking RAPE and that says more about you. My wife and I discussed this very thing and she agreed/consented to no consent needed and so did I. Yes it goes both ways if she finds me sleeping with a hard dick she can just jump on it and I have no problem with that. My wife and I are both consenting adults that know what we want and understand this does not fall under rape as we both consented to this system.	I’m confused. Are you asking if we’re embarrassed to have a boner around our wife? If I have one in the morning I usually pee it out or ask her to fuck if she’s up for it. Morning sex is just as good
Have you ever got to the point where you just didnt want a relationship at a certain point in your life?	Right now. I'm 19 years old. Basically, I'm too mature and girls my age don't want a serious relationship (why the hell?) So yeah, I'm not getting interested in any girls anymore since last year.	As a 51 year old guy, I have to say yes, just recently. My wife died suddenly about 5 years ago and after a couple years, I started dating again. After a while of meeting women that I simply wasn't attracted to, physically or mentally, I'm done. I've become comfortable on my own. I'm not super happy about being single for the next 25-35 years. But the idea of continuing to try and be disappointed, seems worse.
How do you guys deal with your girlfriend’s guy friends making sexual comments at her?	That your GF is putting herself in situations where such comments are elicited tells you everything you need to know. Chances are that you’re her relationship object and she’s still got a side eye making sure that her options remain open for a better sex object. Women’s hypergamous nature is dichotomous. It has been my experience you’re better off being their sex object than their relationship object. You’re in the wrong camp my man.	Well they don't respect you that's for sure. If they make sexual comments towards your woman and she refuses to shut it down then you shut it down for her. If they joked in front of me about sleeping with her I would joke back about them ending on the back of a milk carton. &#x200B;
What's that 'thing' that hurts but you constantly lie to yourself that it's fine?	When you're having sex and you push so hard just to bash a head against a headboard, while of course having a tongue between the teeth. You keep going like a pro and suck it up. But deep down even the dick is crying.	Loneliness. I have acquaintances and people like me. Few people really like me enough to be friends with me and I spend most of my time alone. I'm used to it but it eats away at you.
Men Who Were In Abusive Relationships, How Has it Affected You?	I'm a weird case, in that I grew up in an abusive home and as an adult won't tolerate ANY of that. Most people normalize it and play out their childhoods in their relationships. So...I'm attentive to any signs of a problem, I'm able to pretty quickly un-invest in someone if they act out, and I'm generally emotionally...not very available. I'm also slow to let people in and quick to kick them out.	Taught me to never trust what others gossip or say. I was hit, abused, everything. I have it on video too, only family has seen that. This was three years ago, and as recently as last fucking week she was still going around telling everyone i hit her not the other way around (she said this last week to a mutual friend of my girlfriend). Guess how many “friends” believed her? Most of em. Thats why whenever i hear a side i wait for both sides and evidence. If you think someone should be believed solely cause of their gender (#believewomen) im here to personally say fuck you with a rusty knife.
They say the strongest men aren’t afraid to show emotion, even for something good. What’s something positive that gets you all welled up?	Reading or hearing stories of people fighting to the death, especially in situations they knew were doomed. I can't imagine the privilege of dying in combat. There is nothing in this world I am more passionate for than dying in combat for a greater cause. Nothing else makes me feel like that.	My niece and nephew have this innate ability to make me tear up at times. I remember one day after losing my first job after college, I just crashed on the couch. I was already falling apart inside. My niece and nephew were over at my parents house, so he just curled up on my couch. “What wrong?” “Just a bad day, bud” He runs away, comes back with a cookie. “These make me happy. They make you happy” He’s almost four now, and still gets me every so often.
Men who never dated or had any serious relationship until after highschool how do you think that has exffectrd you?	Definately a positive manner! In the nicest possible way, I think most of the girls in my year were a bit skanky and overly fertile since most of them had offspring in their late teens/ early 20s so I managed to dodge that bombshell. I was utterly useless at sex at first, but one good hookup friend and you soon pick up all of the stuff you probably missed. &#x200B; Ramble over, it's all good, you got this!	I turned out fine. Honestly, skipping dating in the brutal ass hormonal years where you're not thinking straight was probably a *good* thing. No accidental kids for one.
Female here. What's the best way to offer to pay on the first date?	I'd say just be able to cover some of the bill it the guy comes up short on cash. Most of us (me included) are too proud to let our S/O pay for their meal because we feel like we have failed to provide. Obviously we don't want you to run up a $200 bill so a guy may ask you to pay your end if the deal. But If you really want to pay the bill just ask before you order your food so He will have a heads up.	Alright so reading your message of a story I'm not going to say anything based off of people's personality bc I honestly have no idea what happened. However if you offer to pay, consider that you have done your part in being a self sufficient adult because you COULD pay for yourself and you have offered to do so. If your offer is declined, say thank you and indulge in the other's kindness. Sure it feels nice to help pay the bill but keep in mind it also makes your date feel nice when they are able to pay for you.
How is/was dating after college?	It's fucking horrible, man. I suggest you lock a college girl down now because after college you'll be wading through garbage just to find a girl without children, drug addictions, or facial piercings/excessive tattoos.	As a single college student who just broke up with his first girlfriend and graduating in 3 months, these replies are fucking depressing.
Men of reddi, how did getting in shape change your life?	You're in dangerous waters bro, some extremely healthy and active 500pound person is gonna flip out that you don't have to get in shape to change your life.	Pros: I look better, I'm happier with myself, people are nicer to me (not just girls) and I just feel better in general. Con: I can't eat as many brownies as I would like
People who find out your sons/daughters are not actually yours, what followed in your case?	Child was not mine, led to believe so by wife for 6 years. I was suspicious when the baby had darker skin and I am a European-American, but wife was zealous. When I found out through a paternity test which I had to take with the kid without my wife finding out, as things just got more obvious as she grew, that she wasn’t mine and obviously wife had cheated on me with some thug. I just threw them both out. Fuck that noise. Took wife’s key and forced them out and slammed door. Have ignored everything from them since. Not my kid, not my problem - should’ve thought of that before chasing that ghetto dick. She was trashy and a shitty wife in retrospect so nothing of value was lost.	Well, at the moment she's getting me for child support, so I've lawyered up, petitioned for DNA testing, and am suing the mother for the garnished wages that would've went to taking care of my actual family.
Who gave you the best blowjob(s) of your life, and what was the secret of their technique?	I don’t know if this counts, but for me it was a slut off of Tinder that was into really rough sex and wanted to be hurt. She would take the roughest oral sex I could give. Like rougher than you see on porn sites. I can tell you, It is something worth having.	I'm lucky enough to say it's the woman I'm currently dating. I don't know the specifics of what she does, but I would say one thing that really helps is she eased my guilt of just receiving pleasure by making it clear she's there because she wants to be/enjoys doing it.
Men who have met their GF through dating apps, what was your first message?	Cringe worthy, im 29 shes 43 now and i said like, I have i huge penis and ill make you squirm all night. Turns out she didnt give a fck but engaged me in conversation and i turned out to be romantic as fck. Together 5 yesrs now.	We met on Tinder, and his first message was in response to a question in my bio (what's your favorite book?). He was the first person who took it seriously and clearly put thought into his answer. We went on a date, and mutually agreed that we weren't looking for anything serious. 9 months later, every time I ask him how the casual thing is going, he tells me to shut up.
Would or do you allow your teenage kid(s) to have sex under your roof and why?	Hell no. Do it in secret like we did. Sex is a grown up privilege like drinking and I feel it should be earned. There will be some early subterfuge, plenty failure and getting caught, but eventually you will have your own [apartment] where you can do it freely and in relative comfort.	I had a boss who had a gay son. He said he didn't mind his son and his boyfriend doing it in his home. "It's not like I have to worry about them getting pregnant," he said.
What was a cringe/awkward moment a Woman misinterpreted a situation but you where just being friendly or polite?	I was on a hike by myself yesterday and a cute girl and her dog were crossing paths with me. The puppers ran over to me and she introduced the dog. The dog was named 'gorda' which means fat girl in spanish. As i walking away i just yelled, bye bye gorda!! I cringed thinking that she may have thought i called the owner a fat chick but oh well. She's got to get used to it!	Seems like this question comes up about once a week now... Flagged a girl down on the road, pulled my bike up to her driver-side window, she rolled it down and said "I have a boyfriend" I said "that's nice, but you have a flat tire" Then I wheeled into the sunset.
What's the appeal of cumming on a girl's face? And what do you want the girl to do while you do the deed?	I have almost never done it in many years because my wife occupies this dignified pedestal in my eyes and she is also the mom to my daughter - so it is always vaginal pump 😇 However, I have dated two women in the past who were absolute freaks and I’d pump it all over their faces with one hand holding the hair in a bunch and the other spraying it all over and then whacking the face with the cudgel 😅👌 Some women bring out the worst in you because of how they conduct themselves 🤓	Some dudes love it when their partner is so into the sex that they'll do anything, they just want more of you - and those dudes will often happily behave the same way in return. Other dudes get a quick thrill out of what they perceive to be their partner degrading themselves out of desperation. It's a whole light/dark spectrum.
What’s small steps can I take to be more masculine?	2 separate questions: 1. What does being masculine mean to you? What does that look like? 2. How do you dress? Do your clothes actually fit you? If your clothes are quite loose then you will appear more childish.	Take care of yourself, your SO and other important people in your life, adopt a firm handshake, project your voice more (use more air when speaking, hold it in your chest) learn when and how to cry, don't bottle how you feel up, but learn how to do it in an acceptable way, not a great list, but it's one I stick to.
Men who have been left at the altar, what's your story?	She left me for her ex on our wedding day. Years later, her ex (now husband) writes a movie about the whole ordeal, making HIM look like the hero and ME look like the jackass bad guy in the red cowboy boots.	My friend was left at the altar by this woman because her mom opposed the marriage (the dude doesn't make a lot of money) and she ended up letting him know the night before, leaving him to cancel everything and letting everyone know. There was no way of letting EVERYONE KNOW that the wedding was canceled so I printed out a most interesting man meme that read "I don't always cancel weddings, but when I do, I do it with a meme" and glued it to the door of the place where the reception was supposed to take place. I ended up just spending the night with him and another friend with some beer and a bottle of tequila. EDIT: to everyone asking it's worse than you think, they got married a year later and right now are going through a divorce. Unexpected I know.
Guys who've recently told someone you were dating that "this isn't working out": what reasons did you give her/him, and what were the REAL reasons?	Lol i feel bad but i told her she reminded me of my ex and i didn't wana deal. But really she had facial hair and it freaked me the hell out. Shallow but no regrets	**Told them:** I need stability and consistency in life and relationships. I love you, but I can't live without them. I think you love the person you thought I was or the person you thought you could turn me into, but I don't think you love me. I don't think we're compatible. **Kept to myself:** Being in a relationship with you is unpleasant. You are unpleasant. It feels like you are a different person wearing the skin of the person you presented yourself as when we started dating. Her, I miss. You, I never want to see again.
Straight men who are questioned to be gay, how does it make you feel?	I was always flattered; as I likened it to being told I'm optimistic, fashionable, and fun to be around. Turns out it's just because I suck.	When I was growing up I was socially awkward as fuck and grew up in a really religious home so I was always super respectful of girls and boundaries so when I started overhearing some girls insinuating that I might be gay it didn't feel too good.
What's your best "OH SHIT" moment story when you realized you were instantly in a situation?	Sitting in the back of a sheriffs car in the county garage/internal separator from inside to outside. Then washing naked in front of an old man lol baby mommas momma dropped the charges but state picked them up for contributing and probation violation. The judge had an unofficial one on one with me that I failed to visit therefore he issued a warrant lmao fuckin small towns man gotta love them	Spending $400 on music festival tickets then driving 4 hours to realize you and your friend have left the tickets back in your home town
How did your worst date go? What was the experience like?	I’m a female reading these to make sure none of them are about me 😂 but for real tho, let’s have a girl version of these. We have it worse. I guarantee it.	There’s several that come to mind. Went on one where she was txting with her ex the whole time. I paid. No second date. Went on a date with another chick who was more interested in Facebook than me. If they reach for their phone more than twice without good cause, I’m gone. I will no longer inconvenience myself.
When did you realize someone close to you couldn't be trusted?	Fuck his gf to get back at him/her. Have a couple though. One former friend for whatever reason did a complete 180 and started shit talking me and showing screenshots of our convos to someone she knew I really, really did not like. Another former friend flat out blocked me when I voiced an opinion about disagreeing with the war in Iraq. He apparently thought that I thought all the military did there was kill babies or some shit, which I don't, but whatever.	Be happy. You just cut two toxic people from your life. As I've aged, I've cut back my friend circle tremendously. I really only have time for a few, and I want those to be the best.
Guys, have you ghosted someone? If so, for what reason?	Honestly, I get that it's like not the right thing to do or whatever. But, I don't know why everyone gets so bent out of shape about it. I've been ghosted. I've ghosted people. It's basically fine. Frustrating, maybe, but everything about dating is frustrating. Just comes with the territory. It always just means that the ghoster has stopped caring about the ghostee. Which is fine. I guess you could say that not reaching out and officially ending things is shitty, but the fastest, easiest way to get rid of someone you don't care about anymore is to be shitty towards them. And, people are tired, man. It's just the path of least resistance sometimes.	If I match with them, I try my best not to ghost. And if it won't work out, I'll let them know that in a respectful manner. I just go under the assumption people like being treated as adults, and I myself wouldn't like to be ghosted either. So far I haven't ghosted anyone I've matched or went out with.
Have you ever had a dream which makes you sad after you wake up?	Have you ever had a dream that you, um, you had, your, you- you could, you’ll do, you- you wants, you, you could do so, you- you’ll do, you could- you, you want, you want them to do you so much you could do anything?	Had a dream where I ran into someone who had stopped talking to me that I missed very much. We caught up and it felt so good, I woke up feeling so much joy because it had been so vivid. After a few seconds I realized I was still in my room and I had just woken up, and wave of intense sadness washed over me.
Guys who want to eat healthy but are too lazy to cook, what's a quick and easy meal you make?	Sometimes a "meal" isn't what you need. Think about nutrients. Get a nutri bullet or blender. &#x200B; handful of Frozen bag of fruit. handful of greens (spinach, kale, arugala) cinnamon, protein powder. &#x200B; Your body will thank you.	Crock pots are a lifesaver. "Dump a bunch of stuff in a bucket and walk away" is the best way to cook. Stews, chili, I've been meaning to try a roast or something - they're versatile and pretty simple. Grilled chicken and broccoli's pretty easy too. Butter in a pan on medium heat, toss in a chicken breast, flip it after 7 minutes and cook for 7 more. Cut a bunch of broccoli, get a little steamer basket and a small pot. Boil an inch of water in the bottom, add the broccoli after you flip the chicken, take out the basket after you take the chicken out of the pan.
I went to Taco Bell yesterday, ordered at the drive thru, paid for my food and absentmindedly drove off without my food when they handed back my debit card. What dumbfuck thing have you done recently?	Last Wednesday this chick I know bought a taco from Taco Bell. There was a pubic (I think) hair stuck to the wrap.	Recently saw stopped school bus with red lights flashing. I stopped and waited. Eventually remembered I was not in a car; I was walking. Went into client office where they immediately asked why I was standing on the sidewalk \[like an idiot\].
What do I do about potential employer asking for pictures of me "enjoying life"?	Tell them you won't and why you find it wrong. It's not professional to ask for those in an interview.	I see two possibilities here. Either like a lot of people are saying, they are just weird and cult like. But the other possibility I see is that maybe they are using it as a way to get at things that are illegal to ask in an interview. For example if one of your pictures showed you with a beer but the owner is mormon or if they showed you with kids and they were trying to avoid people with kids due to extra sick days they often take.
Men who thought they were never going to find love and eventually found it, how did it happen?	I'll probably be downvoted for this comment but... I honestly feel like some of these stories are Tall Tales from the basement.	Short guy, lousy athlete, skin trouble, workaholic. Woman at client site got stuck waiting to lock the door when I worked late. We got to talking, sometimes grabbed dinner after work, she was interested in the project I was doing. She made me laugh. I talked about places I'd traveled to. We weren't trying to impress each other, but we enjoyed talking and hanging out. We're married, together almost 30 years. She's still my best friend.
How do you guys cope with death, and the thought that we’re all going to die one day?	I've lost all grandparents, and my father. I withdraw. I will never form a friendship again, and I'm out of the dating pool. Everybody leaves. No exceptions. I'm pulling out. I will be professional at work, but interpersonal relationships have halted. I will not risk it. I'm 35.	Interesting that I pop into the sub just now. A good friend of mine, who also happened to be a coworker, died yesterday. Murdered by his ex wife. Shot to death in his home. There's no "coping", I don't think. I think that we usually jsut kinda forget and move on. It most likely won't be on our own terms, so we just kinda go through the motions of life until we don't, and then in the last few seconds, we wonder, "what could have been?" and then a few seconds after that, we probably think "ah, it wasn't that bad all in all" And then that's it. End of film.
Men who have actually dated someone half your age, what are the pros and cons?	I feel like there’s two reasons men do this and neither are healthy. 1. She’s a trophy. She’s super hot and you get to show her off. Typically successful men who are after improving their image in a kind of twisted way. Same reason they buy a Ferrari, they’re essentially buying a girlfriend. 2. To dominate. Men who want a girl they can completely control and manipulate. You’re gonna have a hard time finding a 35 year old woman that you can do this to. A lot easier if the girl is young enough to be your daughter.	Less baggage, more energy. Generally more positive outlook on life and people, and I enjoy and need that. The bullshit is different, depends on the person. Sometimes it's harder to deal with.
How do you live a more interesting life when single/without relying on other people too much?	Try your hand at programming. Doesn't cost much. It's you and your computer. It's you and your ideas. You'll learn a lot about yourself by 'talking' to computer what you want to convey. Compilers are very harsh and unforgiving when you don't give them with precise clarity that they want. You'll learn to express ideas with lot more precision by interacting with your compiler. Think of your programming language compiler/interpreter as your master trying to train you.	"If you observe a really happy man you will find him building a boat, writing a symphony, educating his son, growing double dahlias in his garden. He will not be searching for happiness as if it were a collar button that has rolled under the radiator." -W Beran Wolfe
What do you wish you would’ve asked your roommate before living with them?	Do you do YOGA at 5 am? Gosh I wish I knew he does that before he moved in. College roommate though, had to live with him for 2 months. He was also vegan and constantly nagged about how my meat smelled like an animal corpse. He said he hates meat eaters, because we are destroying the planet. I filled our fridge with pork loin next day, he was pissed. Good times.	"Are you gonna get a job and move to England in the first month, leaving me with double the rent taking care of your stuff which you left here, then cancel my lease which is still under your name, get married without telling anyone, and then die?" Honestly though, I did not even consider asking it.
How long should a woman expect a man to last in bed? Do you feel bothered if a woman has a hard time getting off?	As someone who hasn’t lasted more than 10 minutes in years, it’s likely your choice of men. I’ve been single and selfish with it and don’t make a huge effort to last, most guys are capable of lasting if they make a conscious effort to. Guys who care typically stimulate with hands and mouth long before penetration to ensure the girl is satisfied. The less I care about the other person, the shorter our time is.	The idea I built up in my head is to always give the woman an orgasm through oral first and then go to penetration sex. That was she's already had at least one pleasurable instance and then spend the rest of the sex to make sure she's satisfied. I am a selfish person in real life. I'd like me to be a selfless one during sex. This is just my strategy though.
What's the dumbest thing you've seen someone do that led them to not getting a job?	If you come into hooters to fill out an application and don’t bring a pen so you have to ask someone to borrow one ... the second you leave, your application goes into the trash. I’ve seen this happen many times EDIT: this is worded incorrectly. I saw one boss do this many times at one Hooters location. I have worked at many Hooters in multiple states and have not witnessed this at other locations	It wasn't my hire, but the manager down the hall from me. Guy had worked for us before and was coming back for a higher position. Showed up around 9am and spent the morning filling out his paperwork andBSing with us as we did our morning meetings. He came out to lunch with us and then he and the other manager went to the drug testing facility since it was next door to where we got lunch. I went back to the office and a while later the manger came back just shaking his head. Dude blew a .09. He knew he was coming in for his D/A test too.
It’s sexual assault awareness month. Men who have been groped, grabbed, and or have been forced into sex by a woman or another man, what’s your story?	I get the forced/manipulative sex part, but is it really so bad to get momentarily groped/grabbed out at rowdy public venues? It's happened to me on occasion and I couldn't give less of a shit, if someone tried to press the issue and keep doing it then that's a problem but otherwise whatever. Life is too short to arbitrarily consider yourself a victim over trivial things. I don't like how that gets grouped in with rape by a lot of activists, really understates the severity of it.	I went out to a bar with a friend once and we met a couple of cute girls. We start chatting them up and next thing I know, I'm at home in bed (alone) with no idea how I got there. My truck was in the driveway and I can only recall having a couple of beers. I check my phone and one of the girls from the night before has been added to my phone and my facebook. I check my bank account and I did pay the bar tab (which was considerably more than just a couple of beers), then apparently for dinner at a diner nearby. I called my friend and he had no idea what had happened either and we never heard from those girls again. I'm not sure what all happened but I know I could not consent to anything that night.
Why are you still single?	Because in 2019 women are a liability and no one can act like a reasonable adult and be an honest person.	Low self esteem, not all that attractive imo, and general anxiety and depression. I wanna better myself before finding someone, but every girl (the ones I’ve tried meeting at least) all want the taller type of guys, I’m 5’4” so dating is basically impossible. Idk. I don’t wanna give up but I feel like I do at the same time. It’s rough out there for me.
Men who have never been in a romantic relationship, how do you remain confident?	If you need to be in a romantic relationship to feel confident in yourself then you should fix that. Learn to be happy on your own, you should never need to rely on another person for your own happiness and confidence. Edit: Getting downvoted for saying that you shouldn't rely on another person to feel confident/ happy? Either I understood the question wrong or y'all have a pretty sad outlook on life.	By not associating my identity with anything external. I am complete, and I am enough. I don't need to be in a relationship to feel fulfilled. It sure would be amazing, but I'm very well without.
Men who met the love of your life young (let's say early 20s), how did you make your relationship strong, mature and longlasting despite your age?	This is probably not the same for everyone, but what we do is try to keep some variety in the bedroom. We were high school sweethearts, and at the time we were very into BDSM. She would walk me around the hallways on a leash and give me dog treats. We were in love. Every 6 months or so, we change it up. From BDSM we went to watersports. From watersports to inflation. From inflation to crossdressing. From crossdressing to food. From food to scat and on and on. I actually proposed to her recently by putting a ring up my ass and having her use an enema to clean out my anus and make the ring fall out. Our wedding is coming up and we're gonna name the tables after different kinks.	Communication and determination. People grow so quickly during these years, and it's rare that they grow in parallel fashion. It's important to communicate about **everything,** and to discuss issues until you come to a satisfactory resolution. I find a lack of communication and openness to be the foremost flaw in most young couples. Determination is key because you're not going to be able to stand to be in close proximity to any single human ever (let alone the love of your life) if you don't consciously make the choice to stand by them through anything, and love them **and** their flaws. Lasting love is a choice, a conscious and continuous commitment; it does not happen on accident. Especially not in such turbulent and defining years of one's youth.
How do I stop/prevent being boring?	You're not necessarily boring. You're just an introvert. Also consider that the other person may be the boring one since the two of you clearly have nothing to talk about.	Listen to people and ask them questions about what they are telling you. Ask them about them. People like talking about themselves more than anything. They'll talk about themselves for an hour and think YOU'RE interesting. Edit: Fixed your/you're
What things do you secretly wish your SO would do, that are typically done by the man in the relationship?	Minor vehicle maintenance like oil change, topping off fluids, and washing it frequently. It bugs me when she takes her 06 Accord to the dealership for an oil change using conventional oil and a crappy filter when I have all the tools at home to change it. Not to mention, you can get high class synthetic oil and a top of the line filter for a fraction of what the dealership charges you. Other fluids like coolant, transmission, and brake literally have a MAX line so obviously don't go over that. I don't know if it's a universal thing but every girl I've met so far has had a messy car interior. My gf also doesn't wash her car that frequently and when I ask her to she says she doesn't have time even though she's on her phone during the weekends doing nothing >:(	Initiate sex. I’ve had very few girlfriends who would ever initiate sex ever, let alone be the one to initiate it half the time. I’ve talked about it with them and they even admit to being horny when we were alone at home and sex could have easily happened. Just couldn’t get the nerve to initiate or didn’t occur that they could just walk over and be like “let’s go to the bedroom” Ladies. I’m always game. If I’m not right now I can play along until I’m ready to go.
So guys forget about all the bullshit, what is some dating advice you personally have felt is important?	When you pull up to go knock on her door to take her out, you lock all the doors on the car. Then you walk her to the car, use your key to unlock her door for her, open it for her, and close it for her. Then you walk around the back to get in and you watch to see if she leans across to unlock the door for you. If she doesn't, you dump her and dump her fast. This is the point where she's being on her best behavior, being the most considerate she may ever be and its only downhill from there. If she's not willing to do this small thing for you, she's no good. My wife passed the door test, and we're solid. Just saying.	Figure out the difference between a bad occasion and a bad situation. Not every relationship is worth sticking around for, but not every negative is worth ending things over either.
How much time or how many meetings do you need, before you feel comfortable to sleep with a new partner?	I need to sleep with a partner before I can truly have an emotional connection with a partner. I've only had one instance where I didn't and we were together for nearly 4 months before we had sex.	Impossible to say on a generalized scale. I absolutely do require a strong emotional connection before wanting to have sex with someone, but how many "meetings" it takes for that emotional connection to form, really, really depends on the individual case. Certainly would never happen on the first, second, or third date though.
Men with 6 pack abs: how hard did you have to work for it?	I've heard the saying that "abs are made in the kitchen". I agree for the most part, but you can't lose weight by only eating right. You have to work out and eat right. What has worked for me was doing the exercises I wanted ( at first it was arms then cardio.) but over time core stabilization and eventually back workouts. When it comes to fat loss, you have to be in a caloric deficit. You'll get there eventually but you have to work at it for at least month to truly notice a difference.	To have them look fairly lean, it's not too hard. However, to get them extremely lean, it gets very difficult and is exponentially more difficult. Mostly diet and genes
What are some unexpected expenses for single man that younger guys don't think of?	For me it was sex. I’m a really unfortunate looking young male and I consistently have to pay for sex. It can run me anywhere from $100-$300 per bang, depending on quality/looks of the woman.	For me it was everything taken for granted. Toilet paper. Toothpaste. Soap. The way I take these into account is I have a budget and I leave a floating number of my average expenses in that regard to keep me safe. I always overestimate so I have more wiggle room to deal with. Using an excel sheet really helps
What should you do when most of your friends are going nowhere in life?	Find new friends. It won't be the first or the last time you do it. You don't have to ghost them or anything like that, but you need to branch out and meet new people who have similar interests and drives as you. &#x200B; Never allow yourself to remain the smartest guy in a room for too long.	You will gradually grow apart over time. It's sad but that's life. But if they are not actively holding you back right now and you enjoy your time with them then I don't think you need to do anything. You could even be the positive example they need to kick it up a gear. But the second you feel like they're holding you back then you know it's time to put space in between you. Edit- Thanks for the gold :)
Men who are not planning for any children. Why?	Because I believe our society is about to crumble and I'll be dammed if I bring a little fucker to suffer the fall down of civilization. Also, I can't get a relationship to last longer than 2 months , so there is that as well.	My greatest solace at the end of a day of work is that I can go home and completely shut down and goof off until the next morning. The thought of going home and having yet *more* responsibilities waiting for me makes my balls unspool in their sac.
Just chased down a lady who hit my car, what is your most ridiculous car accident story?	A few hours ago I barely grazed this dudes car. I guess he noticed because a few mins later he was LITERALLY CHASING ME DOWN FOR MILES. Geez, what happened to chivalry, aren’t you men supposed to show some respect to us women?	I got rear-ended, pulled over, and the guy who hit me pulled over. The first thing he says was "It's not my fault. My brakes don't work." Whatttttt
What is it about "teaching" that guys enjoy so much?	It is a misplaced drive to display competence. It is completely innate. It is misplaced because teaching is for juveniles, not women. But women activate the protective instincts and the desire to impress, simultaneously. Evolution is powerful but not perfect. Anyways, I married the woman who shut down my mansplaining and explained some things to me. 16 years; 2 kids and counting.	Men are raised to feel that their social value is grounded in expertise from an early age on. So when they can demonstrate expertise (for some that is teaching), many of them get a reward from their subconscious.
What was a silent "bro moment" you shared with a complete stranger?	I was masturbating at a supposedly empty public toilet (its a place where there are less people arpund) and then this handsome dude comes and tells me "I can suck it for you". I let him suck me and then we went our separate ways.	Was at Disney where I got a turkey leg to eat. Some guy who spoke zero English pointed at the food and pulled out a map. I showed him where and left. About an hour later my wife and I were stuck in a crowd. Looking around I see this same guy in the crowd. Dude lifts his turkey leg up with one hand and smiled. I returned the gesture. Food is a universal language
What was running into your ex like while you were on a date with another girl?	I've been with my current girlfriend for a year and a half now, and I still get nervous when I run into my ex :) it's been 2 years now. Of course she always asks why I got so stressed all of a sudden, and I always just give some random excuse. We all go to the same college, by the way	Awesome! Me and my date went to a restaurant and my ex works their and she hooked us up with free deserts. Really great date. My date thought it was weird that we were still friends but after I told her how we broke up she was cool with the whole situation. Edit: Just wanted to say me and my ex left on good terms. At the time, I had major depression and I told her we should break up because this relationship wasn't right - I felt that she was more of a nurse than a actual partner and felt she deserved a better relationship.
What would you think if your fiancée said she wanted to leave her engagement ring at home when she goes to a music festival without you?	Ask her how would you feel if once married you say you’re going out to party for a night and said you’ll be leaving your wedding ring, see what their response would be because no doubt it’ll be different when the shoes on the other foot. It’s fishy to me and a big red flag however, there are alternatives to wedding and engagement rings look em up.	I'd believe her. If she wanted to cheat, it's not like she can't just put it in her fucking pocket ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Men that have been pressured by women into engaging in sexual interactions, what was that situation and how did you handle it? How has it thereon affected you?	Any girl that's pressured for sex got the sex, unless she smelled bad, or was ugly. That's been my rule. I go along with it with a curious and pushy girl 100% of the time if she looks physically healthy and if I'm single. Why wouldn't I? I like sex.	She wanted to have sex with me one night but I didn't want to. So she tried to make me jealous by hitting on my friend. They started dating, now It's been 2 years and they're still together so I guess that worked out pretty well for them.
Bisexual men, what are the differences between dating men and women in your experience?	Bi women here, in my limited experience I have not encountered too many duiferences in the dating process itself. Maybe that women have been more open in discussing relationship stuff, talk to test waters and to tell about any expectations and problems.And in the hooking up itself, men tend to be more "agressive" and the sex rougher, while with women it's more equal footed, more sensual and rithmic, also lasts more time since it's more fluid with a lot of ups and downs instead of a build up and done. Also I've enountered waaaay more women than men who enjoy going down a lot, for long and multiple times... (oh damn, had an awesome date yesterday and I'm having tingly flashbacks now)	Guys tend to be more straightforward with their intentions. They're also slightly hornier. Girls tend to hide it or do mixed signals. Girls are generally more affectionate and sweet. Also, the presence of a penis or vagina.
Men, what makes you want to see a woman again?	I’m a girl here and I know you didn’t ask me but I’m telling my right now it’s not you. Ghosting isn’t normal behavior and unfortunately, you have just been dating he wrong guys. A decent guy, ready to date, emotionally available will tell you directly they aren’t interested. So just keep that in mind you are not the problem.	Ok, this is a very introspective and lengthy topic. I dont think it is any one thing, you are doing ...other than attracting the same type of guy. Where do you meet these guys? Maybe if you got professional counseling it could help you tease this issue out?
What is the best most mind blowing comment that girl made towards you that made your think more of yourself?	Ex gf to other ex gf in my car "did you guys have amazing sex, because we did" saw other ex gf fb msgs, and she describes to her friend "spore2012 is amaaaaaazing in bed". So i got that going for me, which is nice.	When I was going through a divorce, my ex's brother's wife came over to me at a family function, "You're such a good man, she didn't deserve you." I said thank you and just as I was about to walk away, she goes, "Your kids are very lucky, I should've married you". I was taken aback a bit, I was speechless. Needless to say, that was about 10 yrs ago and now they're going through a divorce.
How would you react to a guy friend of your girlfriend having a crush on her?	The holding hands, and arms around her. Even carrying her to bed are all within the boundaries of a best friend. However, the fact they've already slept together changes everything. They're clearly attracted to each other and have no boundaries between them. I hate to break it to you but odds are she's already cheated on you with him. I'm attracted to psychos, it almost always ends badly. Don't be like me. You won't like the normal people if you stick with her too long.	"needed help getting to her bed" mmmmhmmmmm. Woman here, was fully prepared to read something innocuous about a harmless crush. This? Fuck no.
when did you realize you haven't matured yet?	My daughter made a Christmas wish list and stuck it on the fridge last fall. One of the items was for her to move into the guest bedroom, and since we just painted her bedroom last summer, this irritated me. So I promptly took down the list, drew a stick figure ninja with a flame thrower burning that line with the words "DIE DIE DIE" in a speech bubble above his head, and put it back up on the fridge. I'm 37.	If someone says twist the titty and it ain't a beast they are referring to, your always allowed to laugh. That's not maturity, it's mandatory.
So husbands, I’ve been thinking a lot about marriage lately, and I’m curious; How did you know she was the one? And how long did it take you to figure it out?	She's not the one. There's no such thing. She's one of millions of women I could be happy and settled with. Sometimes the truth isn't romantic.	We went through several family shakeups and travel nightmares without breaking a sweat. No relationship is perfect, but when shit goes down, she doesn’t fuck around.
Men who use dating apps and websites, what’s the most cringeworthy and unattractive bio you’ve seen?	I would say half of the time when a woman has a bio (which is pretty rarely), it is something ridiculous. Hard to choose one.	I've always wondered why women (and I guess some men do it as well) put things like "If you're a cheat or a liar then I'm not interested" As if a cheat or a liar is going to read that and move on to continue his search for a girl who is actively looking for cheats and liars.
What is the most pathetic/ridiculous thing another man has done in attempt to assert his dominance over you?	Some guy in a bar was walking around really close to all the guys and getting their face while smirking. When it was my turn, he came up to me, I strategically placed my feet in a certain way, he kind of tripped, fell and spilled his drink all over himself. He said “you want to fucking fight me bro”. I said “you want to fucking fight me!?” While giving him a death stare. He kind of shivered and cowered away. The bartender gave me free drinks for the night, everyone clapped and gave me $100% dollars and I got the 2 hottest chicks in the bar and had a three some and someone gave me their lottery ticket which turned out to be a 50 million dollar ticket and now I’m set for life and I married both of those hot chicks.	I asked a drunk guy to leave the store I was working at and he said " you wanna try me " ,I said "no" , he went "aa" and then left from the store.
What's the oddest thing you've done while driving alone?	Cry, but idk if thats odd. I cry a LOT while driving. If it’s too much i have to stop somewhere bc it blurs my vision	Screamed as loud as I could. It brings an adrenaline rush and buys you a few minutes if you're tired and at risk of falling asleep at the wheel.
Just found out my wife is pregnant, now what?	Paternity test. If it is yours, say goodbye to all your hopes and dreams. Don't worry, you will rationalize it as the best thing that ever happened to you. You will be too busy to see how much happier your childless and single friends are, so you never have any reason to question it.	Hey op, I’m not married or have a kid but thinking linearly here’s what I recommend: 1. Check your insurance and gets to see who fits where and what’ll be better to be under to give birth; also check ups and that coverage 2. Schedule appointments/check ups 3. Ask for materials at these checkups on how to prepare Edit: thanks u/silent_boy for this, but for 1., make sure the doctors that see your baby are in your network and not just the hospital; u/Ghostinthesky has a good point on free ultrasounds and recommends checking for some local services to begin this process of searching for care and knowledge on raising kids!
Single Men of Reddit (25+), what's your biggest insecurity stopping you from meeting women?	Not single ATM, but when I was it was my fear of getting #MeToo'd for looking at a woman the wrong way combined with my aversion for the bullshit that is online dating.	Near total lack of experience with dating and relationships, complete lack of a social life, lack of chance to meet single women when I do interact socially. Among other things. I mean, take your pick, really. I've got alot of options...
Men of Askmen, what are the tell-tale signs of instability in a woman?	1, Too much makeup, collagen lips, constant selfies, basically too much time on looks. 2, if she treats other people badly, talks too much trash about others (or generally always speaking negatively about others) and loves drama.	* Abusive childhood or upbringing in general - not necessarily a red flag but many people with abusive childhoods never learned healthy coping skills because of the toxicity around them. Counseling can help though. * Being emotionally unavailable * Always says how much she "hates drama". That may be the case but it doesn't even occur to someone to say that unless they are riddled with drama in their lives. * They have no ability to enforce personal boundaries * They don't respect other peoples boundaries either. * They're a "fixer". * They take the worlds problems on their shoulders. * Everything bothers them, they can't let small things just roll off their backs * All their problems are caused by someone else; they can't accept responsibility for anything. * Had a kid at a super young age
Anecdotally I've noticed a lot of male friends stay in unhappy relationships so much longer than my female friends. In your opinion, what are some of the reasons as to why?	Men are loyal and Think about the Past and what that women might have done for him. Women care only about how they feel in the Moment, loyalty is foreign concept for them.	We don't want to be alone. It's also hard for some of us to find a new partner due to any number of reasons.
What type of affection do you like from the person you're seeing/with?	Being tugged into her warm chest, full of her scent and love… That’s especially necessary when things are bad. That’s when she’s being mama instinctually, and it’s the *sssssexiest*.	Head pats/scratches, back rubs, kisses (mouth, neck, forehead, cheek), cuddling, hugs Also just like compliments or flirting. Anything from "youre really cute" to "i want you to tear my clothes off" works.
What up with guys loving their head and beard being scratched?	depends my head is covered in tumours so when a girl tries to scratch my head she usually comes away with bloody fingers. but generally its considered pleasent.	basically, every man is touch-starved from a very early age. it's a cultural problem and its known to be a contributing factor to a lot of health problems. ladies, touch your man more, he needs it.
Fuck cynicism. What is the most wholesome belief you have about relationships?	A life lived alone is worthless. I don't care what you own, what you've seen, or who you've fucked. If you're alone you're missing out.	I've gotten major pushback from saying this one before: fighting/arguing is not a given in relationships. I've been married for almost 8 years, and my wife and I have never fought. We've had disagreements, but always handled rationally and calmly. We've never raised voices or shouted at each other, slept in separate rooms, or any of the other relationship tropes like that. I've honestly had someone tell me that arguments are basically a requirement for a healthy relationship. Garbage.
As a guy, how do you approach your girlfriend if you need emotional support?	As a woman, disregard all the comments telling you not to open up, or that it's a bad idea etc. If someone percieves emotional vulnerability as weakness, then you need out because that's extremely immature and unsustainable. Nobody wants to spend their life not being heard. My boyfriend is very open with me, and I love that we can have clear lines of communication at all times. Relationships are a two way street, and you should be able to talk to the person you love about anything at any time and not feel judged or loved less. Some people are less expressive and that's ok, but if you need emotional support from your S/o, just ask, and tell them why. I feel so sorry for all the guys who think they can't open up, what a cage.	My bf stays still and gives me a particular look in his eyes. Took me a while but eventually I’ve learnt that it is his way of saying “I could do with a hug from you right now even as everything else feels like shit”. Many times, a simple holding of hands or a hug with a back rub is all it takes to remind him that I am here, you are not alone, be strong and let’s face this together. Yes, even after we fight. Someone’s gotta make the first move towards reconciliation anyway.
If you got the attention women typical get from men, how well would you cope?	I wouldn't be suicidal and depressed and could use my intellect to make the world a better place instead of trying to figure out how to get attention from woman and I would propably become a slut and an influencer	Start a thirst trap IG. Sell tummy tea and fashionNova Take pictures in my draws put on a wig and say it's cosplay. Sell the pictures on patreon.
First day of nicotine patch. Smoked for four 4 years, and finally decided to quit. How did you guys handle your first few weeks?	Well youre still getting nicotine so it shouldnt be THAT hard. The real difficult part is cutting out the nicotine. I quit cigs for vaping and eventually quit vaping cold turkey. Dont get me wrong its wonderful youre quitting but really, the 'hard part' is the literal physical addiction. You will rationalize with yourself why you should get to smoke again over ane over. DONT do it. A relapse doesnt mean to you failed overall, just this one time. I quit nicotine cold turkey about 3 or 4 times before it stuck. Each time was for 2-4 months. Now Ive been 100% nicotine free for almost a year and a half with no fear of ever going back. Ps. Not being sick all the fucking time is nice too	Try and stay away from other smokers. Chewing gum helps. I also found that pretending to smoke a straw helped. Remember, the longer you hold out, the easier it gets.
What are some things men don't tell women?	How most women will never understand real responsibility or real consequences because their pussy functions as a get out of jail free card	Someone complimented my shirt on campus today. It was my favorite shirt before that, now I practically consider it my only shirt
What's a compliment that you rarely receive but, when you do, it means a lot to you?	I don't like compliments. I know what I do well, I don't need anyone else's opinion. Constructive criticism or shut up.	It's such a bro thing but if someone mentions that they can tell I've been working out or a friend will say "You're looking big, dude" or something. That feels nice. Also when people compliment things that I've done or built. Like I redid my landscaping in front of my house shortly after moving in. My dad comments on it every time he comes over with "you've made this all look so much better" Feels good.
Men of reddit: How do I get over the fact my 20s were a failure compared to most other guys?	How about you try not being a fucking whiner? Why on earth are you comparing your experience to anyone else's as a metric of success or self-worth? That's pathetic and immature. All the wasted years are over, that you is dead, so there really isn't anything to get over other than this mincing little bitch phase you seem to be stuck in. You've identified your problem areas, now change your fucking behavior or shut your fucking cunt mouth.	I think that you need some perspective here: 1 - you have had long term relationships, which is better than many men. 2 - you persevered and completed a degree even though you didn’t enjoy it. This shows good attitude and effort. 3 - you have a job and are working to support yourself 4 - you have travelled to many places and experienced the world. You are comparing yourself to a Hollywood fantasy, which isn’t real. It does sound that you are isolated and lonely though, so I’d suggest speaking to a therapist or life coach to work through how to improve this and your own self-image. You are doing much, much better than you think you are.
Just watched the Friends episode where Chandler “moves” to Yemen to avoid dating Janice. What’s the most extreme thing you’ve done to avoid an admirer?	I don't have one, probably because that's a childish game to play instead of just communicating your needs like an adult. What I tell women is "I had a great time tonight, and I would like to see you again in the future. Don't be worried if I don't text you tomorrow because I'm really independent, and I really enjoy my own company. Message me when you get home so I know you've made it home okay."	Convinced this girl i was gay. Wasn't so hard as i got my friend to hold my hand in front of her for about a week. She was a wack job
How do I make/keep male friends without them becoming romantically interested/assuming I’m romantically interested?	I guess just be the one they won't think of. Like be ugly, be revolting, be a little too honest, mock them, anything off putting, just don't be too normal. You don't have to do it all the time, just occasionally to put them in their place.	I can't speak for all guys, but if I had a great female friend I got along with, cared for and was attracted to... Well those are basically the qualities I look for in a gf. I don't know what to tell you. I'll risk a friendship for more. For every one guy that actually does ask you out, there are probably 5 that don't have the courage to do so.
What was said to you after, “You’re a great guy, but...”?	Your one ball is too big, everytime I go to lick your ass hole it slaps me in the eye, I'm tired of going to work with black eyes	“But im into someone else.” I thought it was a very polite and honest way to say no so it waant too bad
Men, how would you react if this "sex strike" happened?	If it was not indefinite and was slated to last like a month or something I would support my wife's solidarity.	If every woman in America did it, it would generate change. But the people having sex with the anti-abortion crowd are probably on the same team for the most part.
Fellow men, how do I stop being a "Nice Guy"?	Read no More Mr. Nice guy by Robert Glover. It changed my life. And presented me with knowledge I had no idea existed.	Covert contracts are common with Nice Guys. I.e: doing something and expecting to receive specific things back without stating them. (and getting upset when people don't live up to/deliver on those expectations).
Men of AskMen what is something unexpected you have learned from being in a relationship?	That I hate commitment. Just wanted to bang and go on dates with other girls the whole time. Glad that's over.	I love having my head pat. Not like up and down like slapping, like stoking a hand through my hair, and that kind of stuff
Guys how did you find something worth living for?	To change the world. Make things that make it better. No matter how small a thing or that change may be. (I'm an engineering student)	My reason to live is spite against life itself tbh. I've survived this long and life isn't going to kill me.
When have you felt the least attractive?	When my 5'4 ex girlfriend told me I was too short (5'9) and she couldn't wear her favorite heels around me.	High school. Overweight, acne, bad hair do, no clothing sense. I was standing in the lunch line and we didn't tend to stand facing forward, we'd stand basically sideways, shoulder to shoulder. The girl in front of me was pretty and made me feel like i shouldn't look her way as to not come off as a creep or whatever so i was looking away. Then i felt like i could feel her looking at me so i turn and lock eyes with her and she just goes, "Uhg" and makes a face of being absolutely repulsed. That i think is the singular point i can point back to as to when physical insecurities began growing and the anxiety around girls started. I was like, 15. Other stuff happened as well, but i'd say that highschool girls are some of the most brutal people on the planet.
What is the most polite way to remove one's self from a date when the woman lied/tricked you about her appearance and you don't wanna advance?	I feel like you should confront her a bit and tell her that she doesn't look like what you were expecting and tell her to stop using deceptive images regarding her appearance so the situation doesn't end up happening again. Tell her that maybe someone else might like how she looks but you're not interested because you were trying to meet up with the girl that she used as her profile or posed as.	Straight up. "I'm not feeling a connection." Edit: let me clarify. This is what I would say to someone. To me it is about connection, I want to feel a feiry passion for which I want to fuck/or get fucked for hours. And/or cuddle. My point is be honest and upfront. Dont waste people time. She obviously wasted yours by her lies. You aren't being rude in telling her like it is. Maybe gays are more casual about it.
Men of Reddit, as the technology advances, would you ever consider buying a Robot Sex-Doll? Why or why not? Do you have any reservations about them?	To me, sex is awesome because: -I'm giving pleasure to a girl I like/love -I'm getting validation that I'm desirable from a girl I like/love -I'm sharing a very intimate moment with a girl I like/love -It feels nice. Three of these things require another person. The last one by itself is achievable by masturbating. So no, I'm not gonna spend a thousand bucks on a big and awkward fleshlight.	I think about the after jerking shame and how it would increase exponentially if I was staring at a robot filled with my cum.
When you met a not cute girl, what did she say that made her cute in your eyes?	OP did you just post this question because someone posted a questing asking the converse of what you're asking just several hours earlier? I.e what made a girl 'ugly' instead of 'cute' to someone?	She kept the conversation interesting, we had common interests and she likes singing. Just 2 days ago, I went on a date with a better looking girl but it was nowhere as fun as talking to the less attractive girl. When I got back home we started texting again, and 5 minutes later she was the cutest person alive. She literally seduced me with her personality.
Why did you regret rejecting that girl?	I don't regret it. She turned out to be even crazier than initially thought. She went off the deep end. Got a bunch of tattoos. Constantly changing hair color and now has a kid. I dodged a crazy bullet.	She went on to date an abusive drunk who physically beat her. I never wanted to date her, but I wish her life had played out differently.
Men. Why types of men can you simply not stand and why?	I call them Dad-jokers. They're guys that say an unending stream of mediocre dad jokes, puns and double entendres, mostly around women in an effort to be funny. The problem isn't the joking itself (then they would be comedians and actually interesting), it's that 80% of the jokes are bad and bring nothing to otherwise interesting conversations.	Guys that are huge know it alls, trys to educate everyone, but literally has no idea what they are talking about. Had a dude in my college course that would sit and roll his eyes at you if you answered a question wrong. Someone would say something and he would fight you to the death saying it was wrong. He got below a 70% on all of his tests and literally passed the class by 1% with assistance from our lecture teacher. Everyone hated him.
When is the best time to tell people I'm 4'10 on online dating and why?	I'm legally a midget in your profile is a pretty funny way to start things off. Women are more attracted to men who can laugh at themselves. But I'm sorry for your loss. #tallboysquad	Putting it on your profile bio would be the best place. That way you save yourself from being ghosted when they ask your height, or completely shut down.
Have you ever dated a significantly older woman? How did it go?	When I was late 20s, hooked up with a few mid 50s women. One was off reddit, she looked her age, but she had huge tits. We texted a few weeks then we met at a casino nearby had some drinks, she's a big gambler so she had reward points. Got us a hotel suite (she paid) I ordered us take out. It felt awkward checking in, but the young cute hotel receptionist probably didn't care. Sex was good, blew a load on her stomache. We hooked up once more at her place when her daughter left back to school (college). The other looked mid 30s, active, some work done. I'd take her out on regular dates, she was kinda nutty but sex was amazing. Creampied her a few times. I'm still friends with her on FB,and once in a while I'll browse her photos and rub one out.	Based on your story I feel like the ball is in her court. I would tell her how you feel and let her decide what to do. It sounds like she’s into you, but just not in the right place to get involved right now.
So i asked a lesbian out on a date while her girlfriend was next to us. Men of Reddit, how have you messed up asking someone out?	Inside info. They weren't lesbians. It's just an easy way to get rid of you because they're not interested and to keep you from persisting.	When I was at my first middle school dance, there was a guy that I thought was a girl right? Super long blonde hair, skinny as a rail. I didn’t ask him out but I did ask him to dance 🙏. I never really got to live that down, but he did cut his hair shortly after that so I’m guessing that wasn’t the first time that happened. Turned out to be a pretty cool dude and we became friends.
Getting rejected romantically sucks. But how do you handle situations where they really want to remain friends?	The Friend Zone is a man she doesn't respect enough for sex but whom she wants to use to move her furniture and buy her occasional meals while she's banging some other "hotter" man. Unless you enjoy being used, abused, and treated like a wimp, you handle the situation by letting her know that a woman who isn't sharing sex is not welcome in your life. Use some version of "put out or get out."	Tell them what you told us, that being friends holds you back in the healing process. That is something almost everyone will understand and accept.
How to tell a close mate that bringing his girlfriend to every guy's event is starting to piss off the group just a little?	Hey, bud. I'm telling you straight as a friend should: Look around. No one else is bringing a date to these get-togethers. If you can't come solo, don't show up. It's "Guys' Night". You're pissing off the entire group.	In my experience, after the “ guys only “ conversation, you will just start seeing less and less of him. He will drift away from the group to hang with his girl. It happens in every group of guys.
Men, what is the thing that makes you decide to pursue a girl romantically or just friend zone her?	Generally anything that makes her seem particularly unhealthy is a no-go for me. Bad posture, bad skin, fat (and awkwardly shaped), thin hair, rotten teeth. Also won't consider her if there's obvious psychological trauma. I have never had a problem with sticking my dick in crazy.	A big dividing line is physical appearance. It might sound shallow, but I don't mean she has to be crazy hot or anything, just within the scale of what I call 'hot', which is pretty damn broad. &#x200B; Next it tends to be a mix of humour, comfort and conversation. Basically if those things gel to such an extent that you don't drain me at all, chances are I'll start to want you more. I can't want more with someone who eventually starts to drain me, it just doesn't work, no matter how good a friend they are.
What harsh truths made you a BITTER man?	That I can bust my ass building up my company, and if some weasel cocksucker politician decides he/she wants to have some pet project and increase taxes, I have no choice but to pay. Doesn't matter it mostly tends to benefit people who contribute zero to society.	You can do everything right and still lose. It's life but it makes you wonder why you spent so long trying so hard for nothing.
Men who've been in a workplace setting where it was predominantly women and you were the minority, what was it like?	Ohh we had this inner circle of office bicycle's all married rooting anyone that pulls their dick out , that did the text guy's and do No Fucking work ? Yeah got a complaint about me that I abused her ? I told the boss it was because I rejected her advances .I don't go to clubs or drink alcohol in public , I'll have a beer at home if I want one . I was in a relationship at the time . She does zero work . And messes up everything she lays a hand on . That lady is not touching my me . I'm plenty messed up without any help thank you kindly . And I have never cheated , don't plan on starting soon . 😂 She was madder than a cut snake .	My experiences were all around positive. I used to work jewelry/ shoes at Walmart and clothes was right next to my department. Between them I was one of like 2 guys. There were a few younger girls but for the most part they were middle aged and up. They were some of the nicest coworkers. Yes, they wanted help with heavy and tall stuff, but they were always polite and I was happy to help. I had been losing weight and though I was still big they were always encouraging and would mention when I made progress. I think every work place is different, and luckily I had mostly good coworkers.
Guys who are good with women: How good are you at sensing a woman is interested in you?	I only establish intent. I make it quite clear when I approach women that I'm attracted to them and my end goal is to get in between those sweet walls. Straight up tell them that I don't want to be their friend. I don't want to meet casually. I don't want to "hang out". I don't want to "just talk". I already have enough friends. I'm not interested in whatever she's interested in. Let's go to dinner. My goal is to nut deep in her belly. Works more often than you'd think. Also if a girl ghosts you, consider that a problem that solved itself.	If it's a bar or coffee shop or something and you've seen some indication of interest, usually a smile and prolonged eye contact, you can generally just walk up and say "Hi, I'm name, what's yours?" Small talk for a bit and then ask if you can sit with them. Don't worry about your intent, attractive women get hit on all the time so they know perfectly well what your intentions are. Just treat them like a person and if they're into you they'll reciprocate. If they don't then just take it in stride. I once asked a girl her name and she said "is that the best you can do?" I noped out super fast, I'm not some dancing monkey, I'm just a person trying to get to know you. Same goes for ghosting, it's just disrespectful, you've gotta learn that it's gonna happen and just let it be.
How can I flirt with girls and not make myself the creepy guy?	Situation 1: Guy asks girl out. Girls is uninterested. Guy is automatically a creep. Situation 2: Guy asks girl out. Girls IS interested. Guy is not a creep. And the elusive Situation 3: Girl is interested in guy. Guy is not interested. Girl pretends she was never interested and claims guy was either an asshole or a creep.	Don’t flirt with girls who cannot physically escape from you (if they’re at work, for example). Learn to read body posture, facial expressions, and other nonverbal signals to determine whether she’s receptive to you flirting with her or not. Despite what most guys on this sub will tell you, a creep is not any guy who flirts with a girl who isn’t interested in him. A creep is a guy who won’t take no for an answer and keeps flirting AFTER the girl has shown that she isn’t interested. Girls can be just as creepy imho
Men, if your significant other had NO say, what would your wedding look like?	Me: "How much for the little girl? The women. How much for the women?" Edit: No Blues Brothers fans in here?? So much for Ask "Men"....	Somewhere super remote, like the Maldives. Invite everyone I've ever met, knowing that none will come but will feel obligated to send gifts.
Guys who don't chase after women and let them chase you. How has that been working for you and what is your strategy behind it?	There is no strategy behind it. You only need a strategy if you're chasing something. Also, if you don't chase anybody, there's higher chance somebody will start chasing you.	I don’t chase women, but I don’t make them chase me. The effort you put in should probably be equal or close to equal.
If any, what are some problems you face while being under a female boss as opposed to a male boss?	In my career I've had two female bosses. Both were incredibly hard working, professional and generally a joy to work with as long as you work hard and do what is expected of them. The six or so male bosses have been an absolute mixed bag, mostly of bad habits and being in positions that they don't deserve. After a while I found that getting on with them and getting praise was less of what I did and more of how I did it and how I played them. So in summary from my experiences female bosses are problematic if you enjoy success in the work place from playing games rather than by doing a good job.	My male boss was a jack ass but he was a jack ass to your face,my female boss is a jack ass behind your back .
Men of Reddit, do you find that as you get older you become more conservative/traditional/failing to understand and approve of new trends? How do you guard against that?	The total intolerance of the “liberal youth” is the trend I oppose. I don’t guard against it, I intentionally provoke it. It is delightful to see the small minded dullards defend their intolerance while spouting acceptance.	Honestly i was more conservative when i was younger. Now i just fucking hate both sides and their extreme ends.
at what age did you realize you were "older"?	i am. also realized i can no longer go for girls who are under 22. &#x200B; Shame on you, you most certainly can go for younger women, my wife is 5 years younger than me and it's no big deal and I know lots of guys married to women 5-10 years younger than themselves. As far as age, maybe 15-20 years makes a difference but 5-10 years has never been a nonstarter, women tend to be a little more mature than us guys so being a few years older allows us to "even-up" so to speak.	I think when I hit 27 and I randomly decided to stay home one Friday night because it had been a long, stressful week.
How is your SO different from the “dream-girl/guy” you envisioned in your youth?	When I was younger I thought women actually enjoyed sex like in porn. Now I know they only have that much fun when they are getting paid.....	I always imagined some kind of bohemian, creative-type because that’s what I am (or was anyhow). My wife is actually a calendar-wielding, pencil-pushing square, but that balance of skills has made us an effective pair.
How can a man who is tired of being average become better?	Jordan Peterson is a great motivator to improve in all areas of your life. I'd highly recommend watching some of his lectures on YouTube. Any of them will do.	You already started, now continue from there. Add pushups or other bodyweight exercises after running if you dont want to hit the gym.
How do relationship fights affect men?	In the Myers-Briggs scale, I'm a T-thinking, but I feel very deeply, strongly. I just make decisions by thinking, not with my heart. That being said, when having a conversation/argument that involves emotions, it takes time to process that because when I channel emotion, I'm like a fire hose. It's all or nothing :D I don't trust myself to argue emotionally because it can get ugly quick.	Simply put: for a lot of us, it takes time to process. For me, I need time to fully process emotions. I'm not the most in touch with them at all times. And also, I often realize later something that I wish I had said then, and if I deem it important enough, I'll want to bring it back up. Edit: also, it does affect us. I always feel slightly sick after a fight.
How did you go from "I am incapable of having any relationships" to having a relationship?	Uhh the answer is alcohol. I go through long stretches of not being able to find a date or the chick I talk to looses interest. I blame myself, become miserable. I'm certain that I want to be single, that I'm just gonna have fun on my own and don't drag anyone down with me in the hell hole that I call my life. I go to a party, have a blast start dancing or just chatting with some friendly person and 10- 15 min later I'm making out with her and I end up not in my bed and spend the day there meet up a couple times and after a bit the chick looses interest. I blame it on me, I become miserable... Basically I get so drunk my mouth runs ahead of my anxiety.	Personally for me I didn't get much until I started doing the things I wanted to do. And in all reality, that was just me working on me. Understanding yourself and your self worth is important when meeting people. I remember getting a relationship was my #1 priority for so long. But once I started to focus on doing the things I wanted to do, I met like minded people.
Men of Reddit, have you ever been sexually harassed by a woman and what was your story?	I've been sexually harassed too many times to count, it's really not a big deal honestly. Girls will make comments or be grabby around me, it's no big deal.	Many times, I’ve been in bars, and had a random woman walk by me and pinch my ass as a way of initiating flirting. I could only imagine what would happen if roles were reversed.
What rules do you follow to avoid coming off as a creep?	Aside from the most obvious actions: * if you're ugly/poor = creep * if you're handsome/rich = romantic Most of the stuff that you see in "romantic" movies, if done by the average guy IRL = creep.	If you're getting on a elevator with a woman push the button for your floor first before you offer to push the button for her floor. That way she doesn't think you're following her if you happen to be headed to the same floor. If you do go to the same floor, get off the elevator first. That way, you won't be following her down a hallway or wherever.
what is something that not many women realize men crave in a relationship?	* NSA blow jobs where swallowing is not optional. * "the porn star experience" * not being cheated on * not being taken for granted that we'd foot the bill for the date(s)	* Casual touch, hugs, eye contact or just being looked at. * Your undivided attention to just slow down, check in and connect for a minute or two when I come home * Occasional appreciation for doing routine stuff * Getting to feel attractive/desirable
Ok so I'm at a bar and I'm all liquored up and there is are a lot of very pretty girls here. But they are all in groups. How can I talk to one individual when shes with her friends?	Warning beforehand: Expect to be buffered out by the group as a whole. Buy a round for one of the groups, but don't be flashy. Tell the bartender there next round is on you or something. See if one of them comes to you. That's my safest and least-cringey advice amigo. Good luck.	Rule for next time: Don't go to the bar alone. It's MUCH easier if you have one or two other people.
What is the most romantic thing a partner has done for you, that might not have been intended to mean so much?	Even during a four year relationship. I don't believe I have had a romantic act directed towards me. It was always me to her. (Whomever she has been throughout my life. Short term partners or that four year relationship )	My wife has a strong belief in the concept of the nuclear family. Doesn’t like the idea of having our parents on either side live with us. That being said, my mom is really sick with cancer. She and I are really close. The other day after a particularly bad call with my mom (fluid filled lungs, etc), my wife told me we should set up our guest room for my parents once my mom’s current set of treatments is over. She knows how much my moms health and happiness means to me and is happily going to disrupt her life, especially during residency, because she knows how much peace of mind it will bring me. Maybe not typically romantic, but it was to me.
What was your awkward moment with your daughters laundry?	That’s enough reddit for today .. way more talk about discharge than I ever cared to see in my lifetime 😒🤷‍♀️	My little girl tossed a new shirt covered in very fine glitter into the same load as my work uniforms. I grabbed my stuff out of the dryer at O'dark30 and headed into work. I got to be Sergeant Sparkle Butt for a day.
As a man in a relationship of over 2 years I've often found that as the guy you're expected to automatically be happy or at the very least completely emotionally stable in any situation, is this common in healthy relationships, and if not what seemed to help ease it?	Its 2019 man. You're allowed to show some emotion and get a bit freaked every now and again, its perfectly normal. You don't need to worry about easing it until it becomes something that is happening every other day. That's when its unhealthy... Also tell your other half to chill out (maybe not directly like that as it'll go down like a lead balloon I'm sure). You do you and you've got your own shit to deal with rn without being tremendously attentive. You're #1 to you, not her. If shes cool she should respect it and chill.	+1 on just telling her. Likewise, if she knows what you’re going through, she needs to respect your time, personal space, and personal priorities.
Men of Reddit, what’s the creepiest thing a girl has done to you?	Some weird girl in high school had an obsessive crush on me since day one just because I talked to her once. She first started by telling a bunch of people and I had a lot of girls coming up to me trying to pressure me into asking her out. She also had her creepy friends keep reminding me that she liked me and that I should give her a chance. She got one of my close female friends (who was sort of friends with her at the time) to pass the message, but since I was more comfortable talking to my friend I told her to tell her I wasn’t interested. She got a case of sour grapes then spent the rest of high school harassing me and getting her weird friends to harass me as well.	Wearing a kilt. She decided to just check what was going on beneath it. No foreplay, just.. hey what do you have going on there, * reach *.
What's your most awkward accidental penis touch story?	Gay thread where OP tries to humble brag about a huge Johnson that everyone just can’t help but grab. First story did not happen, second is embellished at best	A girl in my gym class was going for the ball in volleyball as I was going for it. She slammed my dick hard enough I almost blacked out. Felt worse than when I got stabbed ( which was also an accident).
On the Ask of: "Never Stop Courting Your Wife", what can Wives/Girlfriends do for their SOs' to make them/you feel special, loved and courted back?	Stay in shape! Nothing says “I’m not courting you any more” like gaining a bunch of weight and draining the lust out of the sexual experience.	Some things my wife does to make me feel loved: Be the big spoon every now and then. Snuggle up next to me in places like the theater, train rides, etc. Hold my hand when walking Even though she’s reading, just sit out on the boat with me while I go fishing. She’s there to talk and enjoy company with me.
How would you feel if a woman gave you flowers ?	>I’m a girl and I always wanted to ask a guy out on a date and give home roses. Why? I would certainly appreciate the gesture, and sincerely thank you. When get home I'll probably throw them in the garbage. What else am I supposed to do with them?	I'm not a flower guy but I'm a sucker for gestures like that. The first time my wife got them for me (we had been dating for a while at the time) she brought them to my work, I was a mechanic and I was all greasy and oily absolutely cheesing walking back into the shop. The guys gave me shit but I loved it.
What age do you stop being naked around your kids?	Honestly I just think it’s inappropriate. Is the benefit that much that it overrides your child’s limited understanding of nudity. Just chuck on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt. I wouldn’t walk around with my knob out while I hold my 8month old baby. Just all kinds of wrong to do it regularly and I’m no prude.	I’m 28 and my mum still refuses to wear appropriate clothing. I’d say the point when your kid starts getting embarrassed is a good stopping point if you haven’t already
Men of reddit, what is the most disgusting thing you do in private?	Play with my cumstring after masturbating. Sometimes I fling it around like a sticky hand and see how far it stretches	I found rock candy on the dirty as floor of my car, got super excited and put it in my mouth. It was just a rock.
Men who avoided getting into relationships, how long did you try to stay single and what was the reason why?	simple: guys avoid relationships when they don't have feelings for someone. if a guy has strong feelings for someone, likely he won't avoid the relationship. guys usually want sex, and will have sex with someone they're not emotionally into. and usually don't want a relationship with someone they're not really into. sometimes we'll end up in a relationship that starts out as sex. but feelings never really develop. then it's just a matter of time before the breakup.	20-24 I stayed out of them because my girlfriend cheated on me. I had huge trust issues after it. A girl gave me her phone number one day, I thought she was the greatest thing in the world for 6.5 years till this past February when she broke off our engagement to “be alone” ..with her gym buddy.
If you were given the offer to restart your life since childhood with all the knowledge that you currently have to change things, would you accept it? Why or why not?	Not a chance... I may be able to change my own circumstances, but I could not stop people from disregarding each other, valuing profit over our environment and just been down right self-serving ass holes to one another. Humanities motto, 'Bless me, fuck everyone'. I will not suffer stupid people any longer than I have to.	Fucking absolutely. * I'd be a lot more assertive in school, in terms of relationships. I still might not have gotten one, but I'd have a better chance. * I would have spent a lot more time with my dad. I Miss him every day. * I would have bought as much bitcoin I could when it was 6 cents in 2011, and I would have sold when it was $19,000 in December 2017. I'd be a billionaire today.
How do I get guys to realize they’re attractive?	It appears that a lot of men’s self worth is tied to a woman sleeping with them. Do not listen to that advice.	"Talkin' ain't doin'." - Zoe Washburne And I don't use this quote to make an innuendo, but rather to point out that words alone often aren't enough to break through decades of male self-loathing. It takes time, effort, and attention.
I find it so hot when men are good with babies/ little kids. Do you feel the same with women?	Pretty sure that is an age thing not a gender thing. Most women of childbearing age flip out over anything "baby". Guys tend to not care right up until they're holding / seeing their own. Like a weird switch in the brain.	It's nice, but it doesn't make any dick rock hard or anything. More sentimental than that, I'd say. &#x200B; Or in other words, more like a heart-on than a hard-on.
From the male point of view, how can you tell that a female friend is attracted to you?	well as we men do not have female friends for the sake of friendship we can tell when they let us hit...actually pretty easy	They'll tell you several years later. Edit: Wow, two golds. I want to thank my mama, Vikki, Kari, Lauren, and Dani. Without these special girls life would be much less confusing.
Men in your 20s, what are your biggest frustrations with women who are the same age as you?	My biggest struggle by far is finding a woman interested in shooting/firearms. It is a deal breaker for me. They don’t have to like guns necessarily, but if their on the ban train or “don’t have those in ‘our’ house” thing. I’m out. They are a very large part of my life. I shoot as a hobby, I shoot competitively, and selling guns is a part of my livelihood.	Being in my early 20s, you could be dealing with a grown woman. You could be dealing with a total child. And it’s not always easy to gauge how they fall on that spectrum immediately.
What's your opinion on bumble and the fact that women have to message men first?	Honestly, super appealing at first as a woman. Now, ugh, it’s terrible. What is the point of both of us matching, me reaching out with a witty opener, and then 24 hours goes by without a response from the guy so we get unmatched? I hate the 24 hour response time. Edit: love that I answer the question (I hate the 24 hour window) and get downvoted into oblivion. 🤷🏼‍♀️	I have a sentence in my bio saying to start by telling me their favorite conspiracy theory. The chick ignored that completely, said only hey, then changed her tinder bio (matched on both) to include "tell me your favorite conspiracy theory".
Men: how do you approach the situation when your SO flirts with other guys when you are out partying?	It doesn’t bother me. She’s hot so she gets hit up if I didn’t want it to happen I’d have courted/married ugly chicks. Yes she flirts back, if she didn’t have game I wouldn’t be with her either.	That's gonna be a big "not cool" from me, chief. I don't even know if I'd bother having a boundary-setting conversation, cos it sounds like she's just going to keep doing it behind your back.
What's the worst sex you ever had and what made it so bad?	I don't get all the smelly vag stuff, I've fucked like 70 or 80 women and almost all of them either had no smell or taste or a pretty mild smell or taste. Women are usually immaculate when it comes to sexual hygiene.	She full on slapped me as hard as she could right across the face. Im okay with a little light roughness but that hurt. Definitely killed the mood.
What was your most humiliating hook up experience?	I was 17. Got drunk with this girl and her cute friend. Had them come over, and the cute friend was wayy to drunk she passed out on my floor. So it was me and my friend who i should mention, was going through a buzzed head lesbian phase. She was on the bigger side too. Im tall and skinny af. I climbed up on that and smashed it. I regretted it. But she was a cool girl i was just drunk as fuck. I tell people to this day im like remember when whats her face shaved her head and dyed it blonde? I took her down. Conqured that belly.	My first kiss. I stopped the car in front of her house, leaned over to kiss her. I realize the car is moving and we slam into the back of her dad's truck and her head hits the dash **HARD**. She had to get stitches and I got it bad from her Dad. &#x200B; Shoulda parked.
What makes your average guy attractive?	Confidence and being a nice gentleman. Can’t believe how many guys I thought were cute came out to be assholes and then they were ugly to me afterwards.	According to some studies, most women think that most men are below average in appearance. With that being the case, you need to use multipliers to make up the difference. You'd be surprised how much having good posture and a nice pair of shoes makes a difference. Make eye contact. Learn something, play an instrument, cook, improv, woodworking.... Become passionate about something.
Guys who waited until mariage to start having sex because of their girlfriend, how long did you wait and was it worth it?	Something I'd add is if you're jerking off a ton and watching porn, are you really waiting? At that point you'd be doing more harm than good in my opinion. Harm to your brain chemistry. A mans desire for a woman should be almost unbearable. Don't jerk off for a while and see what I mean.	As long as you're with someone who's going to be emotionally available, positive, and empathetic, you'll discover pretty quickly that losing your virginity is just not a big deal. It's silly to have sex just to be able to say you did, but if you're with someone you really care about and trust, it's silly to wait if you want to do it. Use a fuckin condom.
when watching porn, how often do you try to cum as the same time as the guy in the video?	I don't watch heterosexual porn, even though I'm a heterosexual male! I'm all about solo and lesbian porn... Soft core, mostly. Can't stand the sight of someone else's dick. I hope I'm not the only one with that... Problem.	This is hilarious to me. One weird thing I think is hot, is the moment when people change positions. A couple banging away in the same position gets boring after a while, but when they stop, pull out, change positions and stick it back in turns me on for some reason.
When did confidence finally happen for you?	I am all that like you, but I found out that the mindset is important. I don't have a girlfriend but will having one change my life in anyway towards an absolute betterment? No. Nothing will do that. I've just accepted that I prefer being alone and I'm okay with it. Comparison is no good. The second you start doing that, you see the things that you don't have. After realizing that my confidence has gotten better. Also I'm seeing gainz so that's a plus seeing your hardwork paying off.	Lost a lot of weight and finally started properly looking after myself. I have a proper haircut now, wear fitting, nice clothing and such things. I can clearly notice that my environment now pays a lot more attention to me.
What do you guys do after work?	I drink, smoke pot, watch porno, feed the cats, eat some toast, and maybe get some hours in on a hobby or video game.	I (29M) recently got into cooking. I finish work by 4, then head to the store to buy groceries for whatever I want to cook that night. It's a good hobby to develop. I'm not a good cook by any means, but getting better and eating healthier. I try to have food ready by the time my wife is home from work. The big hurdle is finding recipes that work for you. Stuffed Bell Peppers are simple, delicious, and make convenient leftovers that are easy to re-heat.
Men of Reddit, can you feel when a girl is having an orgasm while you’re inside of her? Does it feel substantially wetter/better afterwards?	If you can't feel her orgasming from inside you aren't giving her orgasms. Straight up. Or you've killed all the nerves in your dick from death grip masturbation. Or you have a small dick. Take your pick.	Why is the top answer not "It depends entirely on the woman and the quality of the orgasm." ? Seriously. I've been with some women who it felt live a water faucet had been turned on the second it happens. Some give zero indication whatsoever but then just tell you that they came. Just leaving you confused and trying to make it happen again. Some will have muscle contractions that you can feel around your guy. (Had an ex that did a lot of kegals, worried that she could rip it off) It's just depends. And 2 orgasms are seldom alike. In general of my experiences, it gets a bit tighter and a lot wetter. Edit: I guess it is the top answer.
I hear that girls in male-dominated classes like engineering and computer science get a lot of attention from the guys and get hit on a lot. Men in female-dominated classes (eg nursing, education), do you get the same treatment? If so, how often?	Heard second hand: the female drama majors are super horny and bored because the males are all gay. The few straight guys are exhausted all day like the single male lion servicing the pride.	Nurse here. It all depends on who you are working with actually. Ive worked places where nobody on my unit hooked up or was even single for that matter. Other places..... they can be coming left and right. But you learn not to shit where you eat. Plus they talk about everything from shitting, to their periods, to their boyfriends dick. So sometimes just hearing all that shuts it all down.
Men who have been mid-shit when the fire alarm went off at work, what did you do?	Oh for fuck.. Everyone has a fire alarm go of in their work. Why the fuck does it have to be "men"? Yeah, I guided people out but it was my dudy and I'm 100% sure my female employees could have done the same. This sounds sexist as fuck!	Texted a coworker and asked him what the shit was going on. "Hey, is that the fire alarm going off?" "Yeah" "Is it a simulation?" "I don't know man I am taking a shit on the third floor" "Well, looks like we're both fucked" "Yeah"
What's your secret weapon to ending a fight or argument with your SO?	Obligatory not a man but a woman, I think that when people have good emotional maturity, becoming pissed off isn't a thing that happens. I don't feel like arguments should have to be ended because they should never begin in the first place Good communication gives way to discussions, not arguments. Especially very very tough discussions, you never want those to be arguments because that's how things end.	Keeping on topic. Don't argue to win. If they change the subject just straight up ask what it has to do with X and just rewind the conversation. It annoys my wife but at that point she's annoyed anyway and we actually resolve stuff.
I’m wanting to get better at talking to people. How do you hang out at bars on your own?	Don’t. If you have interests find other people in that community through meetups or through stores that cater to your hobbies. That’s the best way. Bars are probably not the answer.	Traveling makes it hard to form a good social circle, so props on giving it a try. My recommendations would be sit at the bar and introduce yourself to the bartender. Explaining your situation, (I'm traveling for work, had to get out of that hotel room, etc) will at least strike up a 3-5 min conversation and plant a seed for more talking throughout the night. If you travel to the same place frequently, make it a point to return to the same place and remember the staff members. If people come to the bar to place rink orders, a simple 'Hey, how's your night going?' will at least illicit a response, and repeating it will increase your chances of actual conversation.
What's the difference between an experienced and an inexperienced woman in bed?	Surprisingly not much. I've fucked virgins and sluts. What really matters is how lazy/entitled the girl is. I've had sluts that will just lay there and take it and just moan and beg for it harder/faster without moving, and virgins that scratch my back, drive their hips down into it, and do everything in their power to make it apparent that they're LOVING it and want more.	when something awkward happens, if she laughs it off and doesn't make a big deal about it, she's good to go
Men of reddit, how do you avoid mentally checking out on life?	Read Marx and Trotsky. I know, but seriously, just do it. You're not crazy at all. I think you need a sense of proportion about these problems, everyone will tell you nothing can be done about them and that might be true for the time being. But things wont stay this way forever, history is moving forward and the best thing you can do is remind yourself that change is the only certainty, and that the apparent stasis the world and even your life seems to be in wont last.	I am checked out. I drag myself to a boring job every day and spend my free time punching people and training to punch people. I intend to punch people for fun until I'm too old, the teach other people to punch people until I die. (What Im trying to say here is that my hobby is boxing and not much else makes me happy.)
How did you manage to screw up a date you were on?	I paid with a gift certificate. This was before the more acceptable gift cards that look like credit cards. I didn’t tell her but I got the gift certificate by complaining about my service on a previous visit. Maybe this girl just didn’t like me but I attributed it to the gift certificate. She was cute too and had big boobs.	Asked a girl on date and we went to the boat show that was in town. We're looking at this huge yacht and she went down the ladder first. I went down the ladder after her and slipped on a rung. I kicked her right in the jaw and knocked her out. Medics came and got her. Never talked to her again.
How comfortable are you with changing your clothes in the same room as your female friend?	No Problem there . I showered naked in Front of my female room mates and in front of 100s of people on beaches all over Europa. What is it with americans and stigmatizing nudity?	i dont assume a regular friend would want to see me naked so out of respect to them i don’t change in front of em
Fit guys that used to be fat, how much did you weigh and how fast did you get fit? Also, what motivated you during the difficult times?	When I was 14 I was 5’3 and 180 lbs. I ran a lot and counted calories which got me down to 120 lbs in about 6 months. I stayed in the 120-130 lbs range for a couple years and then I started lifting weights a year ago and am at 150 lbs at about 15% body fat. So all in all, it took 6 months to lose weight and become skinny from fat. And then a year to recomp my body to look more muscular (but I’m not jacked or super strong by any means).	heaviest was 300 pounds 175 now took me a year and a half motivation illness I felt like shit all day and I was in pain all day I kept a photo of me at my heaviest as my wallpaper on my phone helped remind me of what I was and never wanted to be again
What’s something that most female writers get wrong about writing male characters?	Have you read or seen handmaids tale, this is not what men are like but extremist feminists would like to think that way. I love my mother my sister my wife my friends.	I don’t think they understand modern-day boys. Bullies aren’t going around like, “Give me your much money and meet me at the bike rack at 4:00. You’re dead meat!” I grew up on the 90’s and 00’s. Boy bullies nowadays are just dicks. Like they won’t fight you, they’ll just be a dick to you 24/7. You kind of wish you could just knock them out and it will be over, but when you try something like that, you’re the one who gets in trouble.
What are signs on a date that a woman is using you for free food?	Who is seriously that pressed for a free meal that they'd spend several hours talking with someone they have zero interest in? This really doesn't sound like a common problem that you should be worried about. Most women with normal jobs can pay for their own meal, unless they're hard up or homeless and haven't had steak in years.	If you suggest coffee or a date and she counters with dinner. If you suggest a reasonably priced pizza place and she counters with something expensive. If you ask how she likes to handle to the bill on first dates after she suggests dinner and she wants you to pay.
What's the worst date you've ever been on?	Grabbed coffee and she was really weird She asked if I wanted to grab dinner; I said I was busy. Then we left our separate ways	Was walking down the street and the guy pointed to a specific set of stairs and said, “This was where I proposed to (my ex)”. Needless to say he was NOT over her and things didn’t work out.
Guys with lots of female friend, what is your advice in not getting friendzoned all the time?	If you consider it “the friend zone”, then they’re not friends to you, they’re just potential hook-ups. Be honest with yourself, with us, and with them. Being friends with people means you’re satisfied with being friends. I’ve lots of female friends with whom I share purely platonic friendships. They’re awesome. I’ve got a couple of fwbs. Also cool. I’ve got a partner. She’s baller too. All of these are people I’d be friends with, regardless of sex.	I have lots of female friends, but I've always been genuinely friends with all of them. I'm not hoping I'll eventually get to date one. If I were to meet a new girl and be interested in being more than friends with her, I'd be a lot more flirty and make that clear. It's not really relevant to me now, as I'm married, but I would say the female friends thing helps because you are way more comfortable and natural interacting with women, you get the social validation, and they'll help you meet more people.
Guys who are with a woman who comes from a wealthier background, how has it impacted your relationship?	I love it. Am British with a posh accent from a family that was once wealthy and poor now. Marrying my wife was essentially getting our house bought for us, now approx £500000+ and never having to worry about the bumps in life.	Dated quite a few rich girls. One thing that has always struck me is that the family relationship is way different. Their dads are almost always these overworked heroes that they worship. Which, coming from a lower middle class background, I'll never understand. I've dated a few that wanted me to be like their dads, and a few that were glad I'm the opposite. The other thing is that the money never really matters, but it does. They've had way more opportunities and can always walk away from obligations if they want to. The price for this is that there are usually stings attached to the family money and most of them hate but accept. So it changes the dynamic because you have to be cool with the conditions that come with the money. If you aren't, changing that dynamic is next to impossible.
What is your story of girls being perverts?	I went out on a date on Sunday. We both play Pokemon Go, and they were having a community day. We were out catching pokemon when she caught a CP 69 Mudkip and immediately showed me and started laughing. Wasn't uncomfortable at all, though admittedly not very deep in the pervert realm.	Girls in middle school used to randomly pull up my shirt, I guess to see my little 12 year old abs? Weird. I wore a kilt as part of a costume to football games in high school, and many girls would lift it up to see if I was wearing anything under it. I would never, ever do the same to a girl in a skirt!
What do you think is the worst part of having an opposite-sex best friend?	You can't have a girl best friend if you're not gay... You can be friendzoned and pretend like a bellend that you're best friends, but deep inside you'll be always thinking about shagging your "best friend" 🤣	When you're at an event with long lines to the restrooms, you have to stand separately while waiting. Then one of you will get through looong before the other and you just have to stand around doing nothing.
Men, what clothes do you find look attractive on women?	Idk why but business/business casual attire really does something for me. I'm also very much into punk/alt style clothing. But honestly, if I find someone attractive it doesn't really matter what they're wearing.	You won't get consistent answers here. Some men like keds and ripped jeans, some men like skirts and heels. Who were those people that told you that your style was slutty? Were any of them men you would actually want to date? How you *you* feel when wearing that style?
Guys, when did you realise that the time has come to propose?	Beware. You say she says one thing then proceeds to do the opposite. Example, doesn't want to move fast... bang, your living together... say she doesn't want to move fast... when are you going to make one of the most important decisions of your life, quick, quick propose. Have you met the parents? What's the hurry? If you continue to see divergence between spoken and action it may be the character of the individual. Things have a tendency to magnify and be more evident over time. Worst case scenario: promises to love and honor then... 7 years in you are replaced but still paying the mortgage... no longer loving and no honor. Been there, done that. Best wishes.	My SO was moving into my place and having a hard time with her flat mate. She finally snapped at her “Sara, it’s been great living with you for three years, but I want to spend my *whole life* with X, so this *is* happening” When I heard that later I was hit in the feels massively and I realised I felt the same. Proposed the next day.
Men who have cheated, why did you?	My GF was a FUCKING BITCH to me, and along came a woman who made me feel good and happy. "Oh, you should have broken up with her first, you monster! There's no excuse for cheating!" Fuck that. If you want to have a good partner, you need to be a good partner. The way she'd been treating me, I didn't feel I owed her shit. I saw my shot at and I took it. It reminded me that female companionship can be fun and can make you feel good. No regrets.	She cheated on me repeatedly. I had no confidence at the time and kept finding ways to forgive her. When someone else finally *did* show an interest in me, it was easy to justify jumping on it. Really the basis for a very toxic relationship.
Fitness men of reddit, what is your best trick for getting into incredible shape?	Work out faster. What I mean is stop resting for 5 minutes between sets. Do a set, rest 5 seconds and then go again. Its weight training + cardio in one shot.	Show up. Literally nothing else matters other than that. Whether that be by showing up at the gym, or not eating all the shitty junk food you've become accustomed to. Just show up.
Identical twin Men, are your beards the same when they grow out too?	I'm not a twin, but me and my older brother look a lot alike except for our height difference. Our beards are almost identical in color and fullness and we currently have them trimmed to the same length. If you took a snapshot of just our bottom jaws, I think you'd have a hard time telling who is who. So I'd have to imagine twins would have the same.	I'm not sure about all, but my twin and I have the same beard growth and our beard and head hair are graying in the exact same places.
Which nightmare (or dream) has left you questioning your sanity or life in general?	the one where me and one of my best friends vividly shagged... 3 years after that one, we started dating lol	I’m not a religious person, but I had a nightmare where I could feel the presence of Satan in the most horrifyingly corrupting way imaginable. I couldn’t sleep the rest of the night, and it really made me a jittery person for several days afterward. I just felt so violated, even though it was just my own mind.
Men who financially support their partner: how do you truly feel about it? Has it changed the dynamic of your relationship at all?	I might be oldschool but I feel happy when I support my girl financially. It's not like she is profiting from me but I as the man feel sorta responsible for her. When we go out, she pays sometimes as well. It's just a manly thing to do, same as paying on the first date. &#x200B; &#x200B; Please radical feminists don't attack me because I said that I feel responsible for women.	It does not make me feel any different. My wife chose to stay home with our autistic daughter. Actually, truth be told, I am glad that she did. My wife is the single most important part of making sure our daughter get's the education & support she needs to become successful, which she really has. In the past year she has developed socially much better than anyone had anticipated. That's primarily because of my wife
What was the most WTF wet dream you ever had?	Aliens invaded the cheese counter of my childhood closest super market. I tried to get rid of them, but as I approached them, time would slow down for me, allowing them to evade. I love cheese, and as a kid, I always had this dream when feverish.	I was fucking a girl doggy style when I came she turned around and had the face of Ray William Johnson .
Men of reddit, what advice would you give to someone who's never been in a fistfight?	Get a pad. Put it on your forehead or cheek and assume a fighting stance. Have someone hit the pad lightly. Then get a bit harder. You are going to get hit. Understand it.	If possible always try to disengage. Fights are not worth it. Its pretty easy to do lasting dmg or reciev. Just need to fall wrong on your head. If you are forced, cornered or have not other option. Fight to win and not to show of. Its not a movie, no fancy move or other shit. Bites, Eyepokes, punches to the balls. Everything is allowed. Do what is necessary to be safe. And one other advice. Never headstomp. Its not worth to go to prison.
How often do you look at the butts?	Always. And if I fail to notice a good one, my wife will squeeze my hand to make sure I do.	If a nice booty walks past and it’s in my line of vision i’ll peep but i’m not trying to be super egregious about it IE craning my neck. Admiring a nice ass is one thing being a creeper is another.
I got told that having a popsocket wasn't manly. What's the dumbest thing that an insecure dude "called you out" on for being "effeminate"?	I was at the bar one day during the winter and was wearing this “ugly” yellow sweaters (you know the ones that look like your grandma made) and this dude kept calling me “gay” for wearing a yellow sweater...I shrugged it off for a while before eventually inviting him outside to “talk” about it. He declined the invitation.	They were selling bottled water at an event and the bottles were made of pink plastic because a portion of the proceeds off the sale of said water bottle went to beat cancer research benefits. Despite the fact that it was sweltering hot and everyone was dripping sweat and proceeds went to a good cause, some guy created a huge kerfuffle because he refused to carry around a pink water bottle and insisted the staff try to find him one that was less threatening.
What are some things you do for your health and personal care that maybe not all men do or know about that you’d swear by?	I got to a chiropractor every six weeks and get worked over, keeps my back and neck in line. I also feel wonderfully sore. I also try to get a manicure and pedicure one a month, I spend my entire work day on my feet and my hands take a beating daily since I’m a chef.	Lately I've been abstaining more from social media to the point that I barely use it anymore. It's done wonders for my productivity and has helped my stress and anxiety to go down. Also stretching does wonders
What's your "I stuck my dick in crazy" story?	I don't know if it counts. As a kid I had to put on jeans before going shopping with my family. I was too lazy to put on underwear. Well while zipping up my pepe got stuck in the fly. We called the ambulance and they had to cut my whole jeans but in the end I got free. To this day I have a scar on it.	Things were going well with this gal so we moved in. She was changing up her birth control and went off the depo shot (which apparently has some very nasty side effects if not renewed). She picked fights almost perpetually, over stuff like the color of her shoes and would stay upset for no less than 6 hours at a time. She was inconsolable after being moved in after two months. Twice she tried to jump out of my moving car while we were driving home. After a couple more months of the patterns escalating, I issued the ultimatum to get help medically, psychologically, something, and after a month no action so I moved out. At least the other housemates were around to validate that she was going nuts, it definitely made me feel like I was taking crazy pills myself having to defend myself most days of the week.
What was the most memorable way a girl approached you?	Memorable but not in a good way. I was a 215 lb powerlifter at the time, but I was also lean. So alot of women would check me out a little or comment in my size. I never liked that attention. I was in a convenience store getting some coconut water on my way to play ball hockey, so I was in my tight athletic clothes. Lady came up and said "wow, do you play in the NFL? You look like a linebacker" as a way of flirting. I just looked at her, said "well that's a reach, lady" paid for my stuff and walked away. I'm 5'9 so no one that knows anything about football would think I'm in the NFL, not as a linebacker for sure.	A girl came up to me while I was at a brewery with some friends and says, “hey you have a sticker on your back, did you know that?” I feel my back, no sticker. She proceeds to put a sticker on my back and says really quickly “and now you have my number too”, then runs off to be with her friends again.
How do you finally say fuck it &amp; change your life for the better?	i just say "fuck it". I dont care about changing my life. End of the day people will let you down and bitches will front on you.	You start listening to people that like you for being who you want to be. Not people that like you for who they want you to be.
How to make her think it’s not my first kiss?	No tongue at first, slowly and soflty open and close your lips onto hers... Mirror what she's doing, also they like it when you kinda grope their arse a bit if you've been kissing for more than 5-10 seconds	If it makes you feel better, I was my boyfriend's first kiss when he was 23 and I couldn't tell.
In your experience, how do the women in your life (not close family) react when you open up emotionally or display vulnerability/weakness in front of them?	This whole men can’t show their weakness thing is totally perpetuated by men. Women don’t thing less of you if you show your emotion. They embrace and prefer it.	Did not go well. They may be supportive at first but after that they start distancing themselves from me and eventually things end. It's very frustrating because i'll constantly listen and be supportive of their issues but the moment I bring up mine suddenly it's a turn off. As men sometimes all we need is just someone to talk to. This literally just happened too. I was seeing a girl who was fighting a spell of depression, I was always there trying to be supportive. She said she wanted me to open up to her. So I did tell her what I was dealing with. She was very supportive in that moment but in the following weeks much more distant and started being rude to me as well. last night I found out she started seeing another dude
25+ year old bachelors or Reddit, what are some of the most pathetic meals you’ve ever made yourself?	Even my worst meal came out great. The laziest thing I'll do for dinner is bacon, eggs and a hash brown patty. One thing you should never skimp out on or try to take the "easy way" on is your food fellas. You have to eat that. To dine well is self respect.	I can actually cooked, but when I was depressed in uni, I would make this one pot pasta.. In the microwave. I would put pasta, onions, peppers, garlic, habaneros, and other seasonings in the bowl with water, cook it for a while, stir, and Nuke again. By this time the water would have reduced, and I would drain it off, put a sachet of cupa soup and pour it back onto the pasta, crack a tin of sardines, add a pinch of sugar, squirt of mayo, and half can of sweetcorn. Like it sounds gross but I fucking loved it. I can only imagine the amount of toxins I absorbed from that fucking container. Another upside the steam would loosen the grime in the microwave, and ill give it a quick wipe down. such a good dorm mate I was.
What’s one thing you’ve learned about women that has saved you a lot of stress?	They are bluffing. You let her argue with you. The negative emotion hurled towards you is actually a radar signal to determine how soft you are. I used to have people pleasing tendencies, low self esteem and low assertiveness, this got me burnt by an energy vampire. Never again. Your fear of not getting pussy is the gift of power, if you know what you want, have solid boundaries, and confidence, their manipulation can not work. End of story.	They are far more concerned with their safety than men, first step with all women is to make them feel safe around you.
If you were to provide a single piece of advice to young men growing up today what would you say?	Don't use Tinder and look for women who have brightly coloured hair and or nose piercings. They are the most open minded and cool women you'll ever meet.	At present your physical fitness largely takes care of itself. This will not always be the case. Take up a sport you enjoy - one that you can keep playing into your 40's and 50's. Could be just weightlifting, or running or something like that - and keep at it forever. Particularly watch it around the end of your 20's. Your body will start to change and your lifestyle will probably become more sedentary - thus your calorie intake requirements will change. Watch it like a hawk - its very hard to wind back the clock, but ***your health is your wealth.*** &#x200B; Also, read novels and classic literature.
I'm a lesbian, what's the best way to politely "turn down" a man hitting on me?	You literally only get shitty responses? That's hard to believe - although I've become aware that different places have wildly different norms (catcalling for instance), so I'm not calling you full of shit here...just saying, based on my experiences it is hard to believe that most, let alone all, men would be shitty about it. But that aside, you're doing it right. If these are the responses you typically get, then I don't know how you can do it better. Nobody owes anybody even an explanation for why they are disinterested - I think we owe each other politeness if we are approached politely, that's it.	Don't offer an excuse. Just politely decline. A good dude will accept that, and a shitty one will act out in a way his own behavior will serve as a reason to tell him to fuck off.
Men of Reddit: Who was the biggest douche bag you ever came across and why did they suck so bad?	I see them on a weekly basis at the gym flexing in front of mirrors, dropping weights and grunting/yelling regardless of how inappropriate it is. I don’t understand how some guys can be such enormous douchebags, the roids bring out the worst in them	Use to have an obese, divorced, pathetic unhappy sad sack of a manager at my job in HS who use to try to always tell me things starting off with "to be a man means you need to....". Meanwhile he was easily the laziest most arrogant douche I ever had the misfortune of working with.
Guys, how do you feel when a girl approach you and asks you out?	Excuse me? A woman approaching a man? What is this kind of unicorn and where can I find her? I would love it if a woman approached me, just once, ever. But maybe I am ugly :(	If you like the guy, do it. Too many guys would love to be asked by a woman bc many others complain they have to do all the job and read the signals. So, yeah. Go for it.
Gentlemen, what's your go-to solution for being with a girl who likes being loud in bed without annoying your flatmates?	Tell her to shut the fuck up; it’s really not hard to be respectful of other people in the house. When you can be loud, be loud; when you can’t, don’t I am seriously turned off by people who don’t have concern/respect for others and a chick who was incapable of recognizing that might not last long	ASK her if she wants you to cover her mouth with your hand. I’ll do that if I’m targeting from the behind. Just wrap your hand around her mouth and let her moan in your hand. HANDS work. But always ask when doing that. Some women don’t like that
Men of Reddit, what are some reasons why you would go dark after a first date that went well?	"Hello, I know I could ask him clear question, but I felt like a bunch of randos from the internet could be mindreaders and do it for me." Maybe he actually doesn't like you, maybe he found someone else, maybe he doesn't have time, maybe he learned you have herpes and your herpes has 3 hepatitis. Who knows.	Couple times this happened to me, it turned out the dude wasn't really done with his ex. You have to be careful not to get too invested in first dates. Both parties might genuinely have a great time, but the other person has a whole life you don't know about. Don't take it personally without good evidence that it's personal.
What has been your most frustrating moment of an attempted invalidation of your hobbies/interests?	So, playing a game that you enjoy is perfectly fine, but... A) You should probably stop leading with it. People have their prejudices, but if they know a little more about you when they find out about the thing they have a prejudice about, they may give you a little credit. B) She could have been engaging in a little playful banter to see how you would react. In response to the insinuation that your hobby is a mark of an immature person, you went with childish petulance. Fail, dude. You might have turned that around with a little self-deprecating humor. Instead you confirmed the prejudice.	When people who watch tv all day complain that i play video games and say it's a waste of time.
Fellas, how did you deal with the flagrant emotions of an ex after getting cheated on?	I went on to a cheating exes profiles, all of em, and cipy/pasted what she did to her page, bio, sent a copy to every single friend...etc.( also changed the emails/passwords. Took her months to recover the info and get her accounts back. ) i DESTROYED almost all of her friendships, ruined her life to such a degree she moved to another state. Even her parents treat her differently from what i hear. She was removed from the will. Gods i felt good getting that revenge.	Yeah you’re justified in feeling those emotions, you won’t heal fully if you’re holding onto it though. In time work on letting it go but for now I would say it’s reasonable to fee the way you do.
We hear a lot about attractive women frustrated that a lot of her male friends are just trying to get in her pants - attractive men, do you have the same problem with your female friends &amp; how much do you hate it?	No, because women never initiate. They just sort of awkwardly hover nearby waiting for you to make the first move. That's easy enough to ignore.	I can't agree I'm attractive, but I get a fair amount of attention and female friends who want to sleep with me but it never severely bothers me nor do I hate it. Women seem to be more subtle about expressing it either way and I never put myself in situations where I'm alone with them. Only irritates me a slight bit since I'm more of a super-longterm relationship kind of guy and dislike the idea of one night stands.
What do you expect from your partner that you can't tell them?	You can remind your current partner that you like sex and can always breakup and find someone more their speed.	Trust and communication is the number one key to a fulfilling marriage. Without trust there is nothing. Sex is 3rd on my list. I did not get married to never have sex again. That marriage contract provided by the state says, I will only have sex with you for the rest of my life, unless we communicate about it first.
What's the biggest bachelor/bachelorette party or wedding night fuck up you have seen?	Bachelor parties are honestly retarded and I hope the toxic tradition dies out. It's either awkward or it's like the scenario you described which is worse. Edit: My bad, to clarify, I meant strip club bachelor parties.	My old boss cheated on his bachelor party night, swore all his friends to secrecy, went through with the wedding then told her on the first night of their honeymoon out of guilt. Married and split up within 1 week!
How does it feel to constantly be viewed as a predator?	What happens if you cross the street and end up I front of another guy? I don't think many women view guys as predators 😅	I always make a point to walk down an extra street if I see a girl going the same direction as me late at night. I'd hate to make someone feel scared about something like that. I tend to avoid playgrounds and primary schools too because people seem to think you're a pedo if you're around those types of places. I'm a pretty young guy but I've already had mothers give me glares and ask me to move if I'm sitting on a park bench near a playground. I just tend to avoid children in general, I was walking my cousin around the city a year ago and 2 people came up to me in the span of a few hours and asked her if she "knew this man" so needless to say I just stay away from kids most of the time. It's safer that way.
What's your most memorable fart?	Once I farted on school and someone pointed it out but I didn't know what a fart was back then	Back in Primary school I tried to muffle a fart against the seat. The hard plastic seat. Instead it became the loudest, most high pitched fart I've heard to this day. edit: a word
How often do you take one look at a girl and think "yeah she's cute but there's no way, no need to waste my time"?	Take it easy bro. They’re just chicks man. Don’t put em on a pedastal. They’re totally ‘whatevs’ to me. Most of em are fuckn crazy and gross. I’ve fucked a good few....and they’re certainly not magical creatures to me. In fact I’d rather fuck a Unicorn now that I mention ‘Magical Creatures’.....but you know.....PETA	for every little positive thing i think that would require effort, theres ten times as much push back from myself. if i think a girl is flirting with me, i will spend the rest of the day convincing myself it was all in my head and not to act on it.
Have you ever had experience when a friendship turned into a romantic relationship?	My current girlfriend of a bit over a year, actually. We met through a mutual friend when she was hooked up with another on a blind date. They went out for a while but between events in their lives and personalities not meshing they didnt work out. She and I stayed friends through all of it and one day we realized we both had out of the blue attraction to each other.	Yes. I’ve never actually “dated.” I’ve just started hanging out with women and at some point, we both realized how we felt and express our feelings for each other. It feels the most organic.
Tired of smoking weed and it's become a soft addiction. Dudes who quit smoking pot, how's life after giving up the devils lettuce?	It sounds like you're looking for an easy way out but there is none. You will go through withdrawal and feel like shit and have intense urges for a couple of weeks. You might even feel like killing yourself. But if you get through it, you will be glad on the other side, because it sounds like that's what you want	I gave it up for the wife. I must admit that I really don't miss it. I think a bit clearer now, more motivated in some aspects, but I did like doing yard work while stoned.
Men, what is the weirdest way you've taken a hit to the groin?	As teens we would play this stupid game called "steel balls" where we'd all sit around with our legs open and toss a lacrosse ball at one another. If you flinched, the thrower/tosser got a free shot with the lacrosse ball.	High school QB hit me with a real bad throw in practice. I would think he was being a dick but I was his blind side tackle which is one of the dumbest people for a QB to piss off.
How have you come to terms with having to text everyone first to have a conversation, knowing you're not anyone's go-to person to talk to?	This is a silly mentality, and I do not share it. If you want to be there for people when they need help, help them before they need to ask it. One shouldn’t feel bad about not being texted first this is the age where ghosting is basically socially acceptable.	I kind of keep myself busy and focus on myself so I don’t need to text other people. When I need to talk to them, I message them; otherwise I just keep to myself and do me.
Guys of Reddit, why are you so nervous and speechless around a very beautiful girl yet you obviously want to talk to them?	Most women value your status and not you as an individual. That is a truth that is dark to know. That said, you should probably try to make her laugh?	Because when I see a beautiful girl I automatically assume she'll want someone better looking than my self. I would love to go approach her, but it feels like it'll be a definite rejection and embarrassment. So I'd rather save myself from damaging my already low self esteem.
Guys who's wives are still crazy over you, what's your secret?	I married a virgin. We also really liked each other as people from day one. And we talked for about 3 months every day before we became sexual. And I'm not a loser. I work through my problems, stay in great shape, admit when I'm wrong, and dont think I'm the shit.	He never stopped doing the small goofy stuff to make me smile. Last week, I turned on the ceiling fan and a bar of chocolate came sailing down from one of the blades. He gets super excited if he has a surprise for me, standing on his toes, and I know it's because he's excited for my reaction. He's always trying to make my life a little brighter, and it never fails to make my heart melt. And it's not just the fun stuff. If he sees me starting to do the dishes, he'll jump in to help without being asked.
What is the most painful experience you’ve had involving your private parts?	Clearly I remember Pickin' on the boy Seemed a harmless little fuck But we unleashed the lion Gnashed his teeth and bit the recessed lady's breast How could I forget And he hit me with a surprise left My jaw left hurting	A centipede was hiding in my shorts and bit me in the dick. I cried for about two hours. Bad day.
How do you flirt with a girl that you’re already friends with?	I leave my plate of food on the dining room table and excuse myself to the bathroom. **That** is where I shit But if you’re going to go for it, don’t really flirt, just make opportunities to hang out one on one and see if something develops... just tread lightly man	I’m going to go a little against the grain here and say, go for the throat. Be friendly, relaxed, and don’t make a big deal about it. But get the question out ASAP. I was in your exact situation, and this girl was a w e s o m e. So I didn’t want to spoil our friendship by going in too much. I took a few weeks of flirting with this friend and dropping hints before asking to take a step into a relationship. Some other guy beat me to the punch! So, while not throwing her off, get it done because the potential pain is worth the potential significant other.
Men who’s SO had plastic surgery after your relationship with them began, what were your thoughts about it?	its not for the man it's the woman's choice. as a guy, i would only ever want my partner to get surgery if that's truly what they wanted to feel better-there's probably a reason im with this woman pre surgery that part of me would be disappointed in seeing her change. but then you love the person first ultimately and everything else second. i couldn't handle being with someone who was trying to modify themselves for me or future partners. that would just be sad unless it was truly necessary/lifechanging and god, if a guy ever convinces a woman to get surgery for him, that guy is straight up EVIL. no i'm not married, no i've not been with a woman who got surgery later. but i answered anyway	Had breast augmentation. Was all for it. Had great results. Biggest lift was in her self esteem. Clothes fit better and confidence went through the roof. That was 19 yrs ago and we just celebrated 30 years marriage. She just farted in the bed next to me.
How to pursue a healthy platonic relationship with a woman?	You're essentially trying to fight your own biology. You could have close females friends and still see them as a potential partner. I don't personally recommend it, but it is possible.	As a guy with mainly female friends, I think it's important to recognize that you can't fight biology in the sense that if they're attractive, you will find them attractive. However, that doesn't mean you have to flirt with them or see them as a potential relationship, that bit is up to you.
Fellow straight dudes, how many of you actually told your first time sexual partner that she was your first time? How many tried to act like you knew something? And how did it go?	She knew it was my first time and it was her's too. Wasn't much to hide given that we were each other's first date, first kiss, etc... It went reasonably well. There was lots of laughing because we didn't know what the fuck we were doing. After a few failed attempts to get it in, we managed. She didn't cum, I did, but she was happy we'd managed. Got better fast and before long we were fucking like bunnies. I was 18 and I think she 14? It was legal at the time, I was a Senior she was a Freshman and we had Romeo and Juliet laws where I was grew up.	I told her. She recoiled and wanted to have an (understandable) conversation about what sex meant to me, why I was a late stage virgin, etc. I imagine she just wanted to ensure that I wasn't going to get attached or harboring some sort of sexual trauma.
How common is it for guys to slap their dick on a vagina before putting it in?	Literally never done this and I think anyone who does is a moron who gets all their ideas from porn.	I did it and my girl thought I didn't know where the vagina entry was, so now I don't do it because I don't want to embarrass myself.
When you have a new girl over, how much do you ask or not ask when making moves?	Dont ask. It makes you look insecure. Try something small like your hand on her leg. If it seems to make her uncomfortable back off if she seems into it progress	Everyone gave pretty solid advice. I'm internally dying at the thought of asking a girl "Can i cup your breast?" when you're cuddling.
What was someting you told your SO that was 100% true but she doesn't believe you?	(I’m a guy first and foremost) that I didn’t care about his size. Then proceeded to ghost me after a six month relationship.	I went to toss a quarter in our change cup, which is an old Talenti ice cream container. Like a pint size so pretty small. Maybe 4-inch diameter opening. I was about 20 feet away and said "I'm going to make this shot 100% do you believe me?" and she said no. I drained it and she no longer doubts me.
If you could give one piece of advice to the single or unmarried women in your life, what would it be?	Stop trying to find an “emotionally available” man. We are men, not your girl friends. You can sit around and spend hours talking about your feelings with them. That’s why you have friends. Come to us with problems that you want solved. That’s what we are for.	Would you be with someone who behaved like you and had the expectations of you that you would have of a partner? No? Then make some adjustments. Be the sort of person you would want to date.
Why are some girls only seen as a means to a good time and nothing worth investing in?	Few things here: * I personally think waiting 1 month is useless. Assholes will stick around anyways, you will just get hurt more. Either wait a considerable ammount of time (6 months+) and risk losing the good guys, or go for something more reasonable like 2-3 dates and you won't mind as much the rejection if it was an asshole. * The majority of girls on Tinder mostly go for the same guys. Those guys get so many matches and girls into them that they usually like to just fuck around. Maybe try to go for someone a bit less popular but more genuine. I know this is easier said than done thought. * Lastly, no idea what you look like, but looking your best helps keep all guys around. Easiest thing to be improved is usually losing weight.	You’re looking for commitment while being on tinder & dating apps, where that’s the exception not the rule/norm. You need to change where you’re looking for guys.
Boyfriend is quitting smoking on the 15th. What are some things that I can do to support him?	Tell his ass to be strong. Tell him not to be weak. Tell him how him being strong really turns u on.	For me, it was about eliminating stress as much as possible. Exercise helped a lot, but keeping busy is a must. I found that going for a walk when I had the urge was super helpful. Everyone is different, but I actually hated encouragement while I was quitting. My wife would tell me how proud she was, and it's great... But every time she brought it up I would get a craving. For me, it was like, let's not talk about it. As a final piece of advice, I'd say... Be supportive if he relapses. It took me 4-5 times to quit, every time I did better though! Good luck to him!!!
Men whose idea of a handshake consists in crushing the other person’s hand, what are you trying to achieve?	We're not crushing. It's called a firm handshake. I immediately disrespect anyone with a weak handshake. If I gave a weak handshake, I would expect no respect.	I don’t know why this happens, but I’ll give you a work-around. When you go in for a handshake, you want that little bit of web between your thumb and index finger to hit the same on their hand. Really get in there deep with the shake. It will keep your hand from collapsing.
How Do Men Feel Love?	1. I lose weight. Particularly around the wallet area. 2. I wonder where said weight loss is going. 3. I put weight back on.	Might be a weird answer but being in love makes me feel completely and totally vulnerable. And it’s a vulnerability that for once, I’m okay with.
How does it make you feel when a woman says she "feels safe with you"?	A little annoyed, like now I'm going to get blamed when she feels unsafe because I'm not around. I really have things to do.	I recently had a girl stay over my place, we slept in the same bed but nothing happened because, while we had both been drinking, I was pretty sober. In the morning she told me I made her feel safe and kissed me goodbye. She then blocked me on everything and we haven't spoken since. So now I just feel confused.
How would you feel about your long-term SO being constantly nude around the house?	1. Don't bring other subreddit in here. We don't want to deal with that kind of shit. 2. Some people like being nude, some people don't. The couple should discuss these things among themselves and come to a mutual agreement. Everybody else can tie their opinion to a rock and throw it into the sea.	You can't fart when you're sitting on the couch if you're naked. Those are the rules and they are strictly imposed.
How would you want the girl you are seeing to tell you she found out she has an STI?	meh, forget all of these truth tellers. call him up screaming mad. tell him that HE gave it to YOU. then he'll have to feel sorry about it and you can manipulate him into some presents, fancy dinners, and endless apologies	I've had this happen. Just call him and tell him. There's no good way to tell him. Just mention he should get tested and that's that.
Inspired by an AskWomen Thread: Bicurious men who have tried having sex with men, what made you dislike it?	Definitely the kissing aspect or anything sensual. It’s definitely a shame most women are wet fish by comparison in the bedroom. Edit: Am really sorry but there is much more zest I’ve found in men over women. It’s my experience not saying it’s true all over and that’s the question the OP asked so get over it	Honest answer. I dont know. Kissing heavy petting all that shit, up and eager. Reached the bedroom, stripped off ready to go and BOOM, soft, couldn't get it back up.
If guys are expected to never be vulnerable, then how can I make a guy feel safe about being vulnerable with me?	Just train him the same way you would a dog. Ask him about his feelings and when he tells you give him a blow job. After a month telling you about his feelings and being vulnerable suddenly won't be a no no.	From my experience, your little involuntary reactions will tell him if he can keep showing more emotion to you. So when he shows a tiny bit of upsetness or anger about an event if you react in the right way, he will keep opening up more with each time. If his emotion is met with awkwardness, a joke or indifference, he will store that information in his subconscious and no matter how many times you tell him "I am here for you" he won't open up with you. Edit: Thank you so much for the awards, all those kind words and so many upvotes. Really unexpected! And to all the guys who had a bad "reaction" experience, please give us more than one chance. Don't shut us out and show nothing on your face. Let us know with a subtle facial expression that you didn't like it.
We've seen a lot of 'bad women's anatomy' what are some examples of bad men's anatomy?	Blue balls (aka Epididymal Hypertension) is a real thing that many men (including myself) experience. Just keep that in mind if you choose to escalate sexual activity but don't want to go all the way. Yes jacking off helps but doesn't relieve the pain immediately and very rarely is that option readily available.	My ex thought guys nutted on demand and that the vast majority of her ex'es were just shitty dudes that didn't want to give her more dick. I got some gems from that one 'I tell you hwhat.
Men of Reddit: what's the one thing you keep in your wallet besides money and cards. Some people keep a condom, some people Band-Aids, what about you?	I know it sounds pretentious, but for 18 years I have a credit card sized copy of the UN Declaration of Human Rights from Amnesty International in my wallet. Just in case of an argument with any right-wing idiot.	I keep a picture of my best friend when he was a kid. Always makes me happy to see my bro when I'm down, I love him so much. We're both in college and go to different schools but whenever break rolls around we always go out of our way to link up again. Always a great time with him.
How do I suppress my lust for other women?	U can't dude, its up to u if u wanna rod as many chicks as u want till u get bored or not	Just channel that energy into your sex life with your SO. Thats what I do if a woman gets flirty with me. I may have a brief fantasy in the moment, but then I go home to my gf fold her into a little pretzel and pound all that energy away.
Men who aren't passionate about anything, what type of career did you get into?	So you think your passion, if you have any, should be your rice bowl even if it pays you poorly? Think my career is my rice bowl and not the center of my life.	I have an intellectual passion in Philosophy (Bachelors) and sporting passion in Soccer (Currently coach kids). But battling depression makes a lot of shit I know I am and should be passionate about pretty muted. I have a masters in Accounting and work as a financial and inventory analyst for a medical supply company. I've automated a lot of what I do, so work flies by and I kind of just sit there with headphones on--not playing any music. I just don't want people bugging me. \-Elmo shrug-
What will make you lose respect for a woman?	Posting her nudes online or doing sexually provocative live streams to make money. Additionally, being a Feminist. Also, if she hates prequel memes. Edit: Dang, a lot of people really hate prequel memes.	If she doesn’t do as she preaches. Example: some of my friends have a group chat where they share nudes of guys they are sent. Most of these are sent after being asked to. They got real mad at one guy who sent a friends nude to someone else after he found out she had done this to him.
[Serious] Men of reddit what was it like having a girlfriend who was a victim of sexual assault?	It depends on of it is severely affecting the relationship. If it is I move on. I will not sign up to be somebody’s therapy or therapist.	There were times when everything is going well and something would trigger her and I'd have to stop just be there for her. Sometimes it'd be just normal daily activates, sometimes foreplay, sometimes during sex. Years later she rarely has this happen to her, but there are still things I've learned will trigger her and I just avoid doing them (coming up behind her to give her a hug).
How would you positively teach resilience and strength to young men, without falling into the trap of the "never show weakness, suck it up" mentality?	i grew up with that "be strong, don't be weak" approach that OP mentions. It is a bad mindset to have. But I managed to turn it into an embrace of stoicism. It's not bad to process your feelings yourself or to take time to think through things and solve your own problems as best you can. It means you are available to help others. I guess I'd try to pass on the stoic approach	Resilience and strength are not necessarily taught, rather formed in the face of adverse circumstances. The only reason I'm resilient and strong is because I had to be to make it on my own, and those qualities were byproducts of working hard to move forward in life. The best way to teach these qualities is through example.
What was the dumbest reason a girl gave you for not wanting to date you or when breaking up with you?	I was this girl: he had a toothpick habit and that’s what I told him when I broke up with him. I mean he carried them around everywhere and picked his teeth at the table. Legit nicest dude I have ever dated. Funny, smart, sweet, decent earner, had a great family and probably would have made an excellent partner and co-parent. All around everything a girl could ask for. But I could not get past the toothpicks and the vision of my future of picking up these wet tiny pieces of wood all over the house.	High school era...I dated a girl for two weeks. She dumped me because I didn't pay enough attention to her. Problem was, she didn't tell me we were dating. I said maybe 5 words to her at some party, and have never seen her since. Her friend told me. I had no idea what she was talking about, and didn't even know my new ex's name yet.
As a guy who gets easily attached, how would you recommend navigating a dating world where who ever cares least wins?	There's your problem. You've been single for two years, now you're desperate. It's not that you don't want flings, you prob couldn't even get em if you tried. What you're trying to do is lock down the first chick that shows interest in you because you put them on a pedestal. ask yourself this: would you still wanna be with just one girl if sex was taken out of the equation? what you need is an abundance mentality.	Be you! Care! Yes it won’t work for a lot of people but those people aren’t meant for you anyways. My husband was very clear that he was very into me and had no issue moving things forward and defining our relationship at a healthy pace. His transparency and honesty put me at ease and really made me trust him. He’s still my best friend and favorite person in the world and I trust him 100%. Don’t try to conform to what you think you’re supposed to be. Just be you and be patient to wait for someone who appreciates the real you!
Single men, how does your week look?	When I was single, all I would do is spend time on myself and my hobbies. I'd spend time with family and friends, I'd go shopping, sometimes alone, and take myself out. Honestly it's made me a better partner now because I know what I'm into, what I'm not, and really used it as an opportunity to find myself. Date yourself! Treat you to a cup of coffee or go see a movie alone. People say it's depressing but seeing a movie by yourself carries some serious big dick energy in my opinion. Go dancing or clubbing, go eat at a fancy restaurant, go to a wine tasting. Learn to be your own best friend and spend time with yourself. Not only will this help you heal but it'll also be fun!	Work, take care of the house, practice sports to stay healthy, read books. play games, watch movies, reserve a couple of days every month to be with friends. Repeat. Single adulthood for the majority of people gets repetitive and boring, despite what facebook and instagram shows. If you value your own company, don't stress out, stay healthy and keep improving yourself. If you've never been in this position, now it's a good to start doing just that.
Have you ever made a major “girlfriend vs. career” decision? How did it turn out?	Kind of disgusted by the amount of people in here saying "Always choose the job." Not every man is a cold-hearted, simple-minded robot.	I was strongly considering joining the Air Force to pursue a TACP career. I was training pretty hard and was just about to contact a recruiter. But military life isn't great for relationships so I ended up not going through with it. I don't regret it at all though.
What's something that made you stop pursuing that dream girl of yours?	When she turned me down when I asked her to prom, I didn't stop. When I went off to college and she moved away, I didn't stop. When we were living 150 miles apart after college, I didn't stop. When she had a baby, I didn't stop. When I got the invitation to her wedding, I didn't stop. When I went to her wedding and watched her get married, I didn't stop. But I did move away - 1,800 miles away. And then, gradually, I stopped. And then a decade later, Facebook.....	When I found pictures of her cousin's dick in her cellphone and she sent him videos of herself masturbating.... Wtf.
Teenage boy bedroom stink; when did your room stop stinking? How did it not bother you?	I didn’t know dudes like that exist Fuck... stashing trash under the bed Wearing shit and stashing it Basically living in a basement environment with the dark conditions Why do guys do that unless they’re depressed	It similar to the problem of people with chronic body odour.... A lot of them don’t know they have it or how bad it is. He probably needs a shock from someone... Hearing an outsider saying how bad it is, something like that.
At what age did you learn you were either very attractive, mediocre or just straight ugly?	Before yall read this thread (though this comment will probably be further down) None of this shit really matters long term. You are worth more than your ability to attract people. There are more things about yourself you could concern yourself with.	14 when girls in my class were gossiping, about the guys they'd date and my name popped up, followed by an "Ew never."
Men who were skinny then became muscular and bigger. How would you say your life changed socially after you made your gains?	I've become more muscular, but it only is visible by my actions. I don't *look* strong, but people forget muscle is dense. Since I don't look muscular, everyone still thinks me as just thin.	Socially, I get made fun of for having muscles in a sarcastic way. As far as dating, I am more attractive, but I'm still the same pussy I was when I was skinny. So overall, not really much has changed.?
Men of reddit, what would be your tips/insight/advice to a woman dating a guy who has never been in a serious relationship?	Don't try for sex until later in the relationship (makes you seem a little trashy), don't ever ever send nudes, in fact try to keep it as IRL as possible. Don't make sexuality or the internet the basis of the relationship. Be honest and straightforward. Be supportive about the never been in a relationship thing but not scolding.	Lots of talking. Communication is key. It's really that simple. And of course don't have any expectation for sex early on. It will probably suck.
What makes you feel the most capable and masculine?	OP I agree. Men are being destroyed with all the bullshit and that is what is. Men have become afraid to be themselves and that is a form of rape in my opinion. All the TV shows are about men being idiots and complete wimps, commercials are always making fun of you, it's pathetic and it's ruining the men who are growing up now. (guys upvote this the woman are going to nail me)	When my girlfriend puts her head on my chest and I put my arm around her. Makes me feel like the strongest shield in the world
What's the worst thing you've overheard someone saying about you?	During college I was walking to class one day and a car goes by and I could hear a guy saying "she's ugly". They were probably checking my ass, since I was wearing tight leggings and I have a nice butt. Guess he didn't like the rest. I can honestly say it didn't bother me too much, by that point I'd made peace with my looks.	In highschool I was super shy somewhat depressed had few friends and was a general loner. I overheard someone say they thought I would shoot up the school one day.
Men who grew up with a “nice guy” father and a controlling mother, how did you overcome the aftereffects?	I'd love to know the exact opposite too: Men who grew up with a good person for a mother, and a controlling immoral father, how did *you* overcome the aftereffects?	Distance helps and make a concerted effort in the women that you pursue. Make every effort not to replace your mother with a woman just like her.
People who have sworn off love, what's made you do it?	I say that I have, but I think it's got more to do with my high standards. For me to consider someone as a potential long-term partner, she needs to be at least a 7/10, be intelligent, capable of conversations about a wide range of topics, have relatively fair skin, be no taller than 5'3", and weigh no more than 135lbs. So a very specific type. This of course only applies to those I would consider viable girlfriends, not just someone I find attractive enough to sleep with.	Manipulative and emotional abusive ex and the aftermath I'm still dealing with from that. Not sworn it off for good, but who knows when I'll let someone close enough and allow myself to feel love again.
What’s the most offensive thing a woman has (Accidentally) asked you?	There’s no chance she was negging you? I’m sure after working out for three years you have some sort of visible muscles.	Had an older manager confused why so many women were interested me. Said I didn't seem like the sexual type.
How do you really get over someone?	time. i ended up everything with my ex one year ago and i closed full contact. 1 week ago she was in my town and needed to give me a bag so we went and had dinner together as friends. she has a cute thing that is calling me by my name when shes about to ask me something silly, and she would make this sweet voice and laugh. she did it at dinner to ask me to drive my car, and last year i would melt and love that little smile... 2 weeks ago i felt nothing, that's how i knew i was over her :) also we went to my house so she could meet my new cat and had sex twice but after that we remained friends and i know i dont love her anymore lol	There are no cheats. Time heals all. Perspective. If you have a habit of checking how they are doing - break it. No contact is the tried and trusted method, if that’s not possible, be cordial.
What’s the Most Romantic Thing You’ve Done?	I made a wooden ring for a girl in a wooden box that I also made, it was her bday, so I guess it was not romantic, but I think thats the biggest commitment that I have made. I had a crush on her though, it ended up that later on she was not interested in a relationship, because she liked older guys with beards. I know she liked me though, but suddenly pufff, stopped talking, not responding etc.. well her problem she missed out.	I drove ~100 miles to get my college boyfriend his favorite ice cream that was at the time only sold in certain regions, including his hometown. I hid the gallons of ice cream in my dorm freezer and asked him to get me some ice. The look on his face when he realized I had gotten the ice cream was amazing. Only a few years later the ice cream was sold much more widely, including at the grocery store next to my dorm.
How often do you have sex with your partner and how long have you two been together?	When I was 26 I’d be good to go anyplace, any time. I would have loved to have you around. I’ve never pushed someone’s hand away from my crotch in my life and hope never to. I hate to say this, but if he’s not getting it from you, are you positive he’s not getting it somewhere else? It may not just be a low sex drive thing.	I'm about your age. I could bang my girlfriend every single day, multiple times a day. One of my best friends told me he only cares about sex once a month. Your bf might just be like my friend, no real deeper reason than that.
What’s the best way to ask a friend to introduce you to an attractive girl they know?	As a single girl with other single girlfriends, it is ALWAYS a pet peeve of mine when my guy friends ask me to play matchmaker. I don’t mind saying “yeah dude Emily is single” but I will not talk either one of you up to the other. It’s not my job to get anyone laid, and in places where I have matchmade before, I’ve been put in the middle of their flirting (ew), fucking (double ew), and fighting (why would I take sides I like you both). Like don’t expect your friends to make it happen for ya, leave them out of it. Go introduce yourself, show some CONFIDENCE BOOOYAH	Introduce yourself: You spot them together talking. You walk up and say, "HEY!" to the dude you know, then you tell cutie, "I don't think we've met. I'm Pete. Hey." You then ask the two of them what they're up to. You listen for a minute, then excuse yourself so they can get back to their conversation (unless one or both invite you to join them in their plans/activities). The next time you see her, you can say, "Hey! I know you! You were with other dude. I'm Pete. How's it going?"
When you pee without holding your penis, does it go wild like a hose or does it just kind of stay still in one place?	This is the power of foreskin. It acts as a counter weight to the piss pressure and allows for hands free peeing. Anyone who says circumcision isn't child abuse has clearly never enjoyed this privilege	Trajectory changes with flow A constant stream stays steady, but starting and ending a piss cause movement; usually in the up/down direction but it can get wild
What's the most hungover you've ever been?	The most I've ever been hungover was the first time I sipped on alcohol. I definitely wasn't truly hungover, but in a way, that was the most hungover I've ever been.	When I was much younger I drank for around seven hours one evening/night, had about an hours' sleep and then staggered to work. I threw up in the sink as soon as I got to work but managed to start working - until I farted. I followed through (shit myself), the smell of which made me puke again. I passed out in the toilet for about 20 minutes, then just staggered home again without telling anyone.
Wife filed for divorce. What am I in for?	R.I.P. You fucked. Your best bet is to try and play the victim and really play the judges emotions trying to get sympathy, that's the only play I have seen that can work. If you can't you are ultra-fucked.	You should talk to an attorney. Each jurisdiction handles family court proceedings a little differently, so if you want accurate information about the process, you should talk to a pro in your area.
What's the worst decision your penis has ever made?	Penis: You might be drunk but i assure you the sex with this fat girl that seems to like you will be great. Girl: No you dont need a condom Me: No fuck you get me one she finally found one, i have fucked her for like 30sec and then I didnt want to anymore, she wasent the prettiest und i was very drunk, later I went to the bathroom to beat the meet and finish the job. I am not proud of what I have done, mainly because she was fat and had no ass.	Dick: "Hey, you're in bed with a super hot girl who wants to have sex with you, but nah, not tonight fam."
I’m moving out of my parents house finally after college and having a job, what advice or tips do you have for living on your own?	Garbage bags. You don't need to buy them. You get them every time you go to the store. My wife and I are in our thirties with two kids and some decent money in the bank. Our trash bags are still just free, plastic grocery sacks. We take the trash out every few days instead of once a week. Who gives a shit, ya know?	Have friends that aren't your roommate. Good fences make good neighbors, and if your roommate is your strongest point of social contact even the strongest of friends will begin to grate on each other.
How does one grapple with being unsure about having a child?	Dude you are 23. A lot of men don't want to be a father at 23. You are way too young.	If you don't want kids, then don't bring them into the world. That's a disservice to their future selves. Also, if you're in a LTR, you should definitely discuss this with your SO and see if that is a deal breaker.
Guys, how do you deal with the feeling that you're constantly "behind" in life?	I don't feel left behind because I own every decision I've made up until this point, even when life throws me curve balls. It's the saying, "hindsight being 20/20." You know you could have done better but with the information that you had, you made the choice that you thought was best and you can't blame yourself for that. I was really depressed about this a year or two ago but I decided there's no use crying over spilled milk, shit happens, and you pick yourself up knowing you're only going to stumble again. It's a matter of mindset.	1. Social media is an emotional cancer. Dump it as much as possible as soon as possible. 2. Stop focusing on what you don't have and start focusing on what you do have.
What's the craziest reaction you've gotten when you told a girl you're not in the mood?	My Mom told me to shut it and go do my homework since I wasn’t in the mood to do my chores.	Best: Want me to just suck you off instead, so you don't have to do any work? Worst: Are you cheating on me with 'insert the name of any woman she has known longer than 5 seconds'?!? Am I not pretty enough? Is there something wrong with me? When did you stop loving me?
What do you only know about yourself that you only know because someone else has told you?	Damn. My cat is named Asa after a singer. You know what I like Joaquin Phoenix as Joker. The best joker from all of them, and Heath Ledger set standards.	I used to silently mouth what I just said. For example, if someone asked what time it was I'd say, "A quarter passed 7," then they would be weirded out as I mouthed, "A quarter passed seven. I used to second guess myself in social situations as a kid. I fixed it by middle school. Has anyone else done this?
Men who started receiving female attention later on in life, how did it feel and how did you deal with your new “popularity” among girls?	I still don’t know how to handle it. It’s so overwhelming to be able to fuck a new girl every week. Fucked 420 hoes in the last 69 weeks, feels good bruh	Honestly at first I thought it was some sort of an elaborate conspiracy hoax among the women in our town to trick me somehow. Then I realized that there's no way all these people know each other and why would they scheme only against me. Took a while to get used to it lol.
What does vagina taste like?	Salty oysters. That's an in shape girl with good hygiene. It's alright, it's a light flavor. It's still not a good taste -- it's discharge, bacteria, and _SNOT_ -- how good did you think it was going to taste!? Far girls or girls with a problem? Worst thing ever!	I was dating this one girl. We were fooling around during the day and I went down on her. Later we went out for Thai food. She ordered an assortment of dishes for both of us to try. I swear she tasted just like the stock in this places Tom Yum Talay. It was just the light broth taste but not fishy. I kept this to myself as I thought it best not to compare her box to fish soup.
Why are your asses always exposed when you bend over?	Probably for the same reason women have 137.5 pairs of shoes on average. Just answering a gender generalization with a gender generalization (in case all the feminist snowflakes didn't get the sarcasm).	I see no other explanation than them being filthy sluts who are begging me to drop coins in there. Copper for my coppertone baby.
Out of all the shirts you own, what are the only 4 you actually wear?	I have the opposite problem. I'd love to wear a different shirt every day of the week but I only have like 4 longsleeve shirts and it's already getting to winter here.	I literally have a work shirt rotation and wear the same 4-5 shirts every week. Tts become a joke whenever I get a new shirt at work. Makes life a lot easier lol
Men with long eyelashes as a side effect of being hairy, how often do women wish they could steal your lashes?	I hear this nearly every day and it's just something I've some to live with. I get it now. It used to make me angry when people would insist I was wearing mascara and eyeliner. Later I used it to my advantage and had all the dates. Now it's just a part of my day for someone to want my eyelashes.	All the fucking time dude, like holy shit. My wife has always been jelous of my eye lashes, says they are wasted on me. We had a daughter a few years ago, and she 100% got my eyelashes. I told my wife that I wasn't wasting them, just saving them to give to her
What’s an appropriate amount of sexual aggressiveness to expect from your wife?	If she won't initiate, then she's probably not gonna change. That's just how some women are. They have all kinds of BS hangups and they worry about stupid shit like.... "I know he's my husband and all but if I initiate sex he'll think I'm a slut and leave me." Stupid shit like that. Go find one that isn't insecure about telling you she wants to fuck.	Her inability / refusal to have a rational conversation about it is a much bigger issue than the one that sparked your original question. I wish I had a solution for that one, but every relationship I've had that had "minefields" that overlapped with things one of us wasn't satisfied with in our relationship it ended, badly. You shouldn't expect her to tolerate you interrogating her about why she isn't jumping you every time you come home, but it's totally unreasonable that she gets upset every time you ask her reasonable questions about a topic that's rather important to a successful marriage. Communication is important, consider seeing a couple's therapist.
What has always been your biggest insecurity as a man?	My height. I'm doing well in all other "man" categories but I'm 5'10", which isn't short but isn't tall. I want to be like 6'1".	My lack of a successful career. I've never wanted to be or do anything in particular. Without that direction and drive, I just sort of ended up in a job that sustains me financially but is by no means impressive to anyone. It's less important for me to have a high-paying job since I have no plans to have children and support a family, but it does bruise my ego to just be a working drone with no sense of "success."
How many of you dudes at the gym are really as mean as you look?	Im the guy at the gym smiling, grinning enjoyin myself. I work my ass off n am focused but between sets im lovin life. Course i smoke bud b4 every gym sesh.	I was a competitive powerlifter, unless I was with my squad or even now days I'm always with headphones while working out. I'd always spot anyone, if they'll ask for tips I'll give em tips and I never try to be bad to anyone.
Other than the penis magic we can cast, what are some hidden things women don't know about us?	If a woman's attractive, every one of her facebook photos has been fapped to. Yes... including that one with your nana. Your eyes caught the light right and there was a comely indent in your blouse beneath the left squeezable.	Male privilege checks actually come once a week, not once a month, so it's actually four times what you might think.
What is the best place to take a woman on a first date? Why is it so good?	Female here. She is assessing you on the first day so you need to show your good sides. For that I would say you need to talk, so brunch, lunch or coffee are a good start. But you also need "elevated heart rate" because she is going to associate her feelings about the experience with you. You need an activity that will make her excited/nervous in a good way. So seeing something beautiful, winning/enjoying a game, a dancing, cooking or a woodworking class, a horror movie, rollercoaster, zoo and so on. This second part should be catered to her preferences/personality. In my case my husband took me to a lunch then to a really nice park. I was doing master's then so walking in the park with sunlight, nature sounds and fresh grass seemed like heaven. I still associate him with peace, sun and happiness.	Brunch. Morning first dates are great. You get together for a bit, not too early, not too late. Chitchat over coffee and pastry. If the vibe is good you ask them if they want to: explore this trail/ catch the matinee/ visit this gallery, whatever to extend the date into the day. If there is no click it is really easy to be all "welp, got stuff to do today, thanks for meeting me this morning."
What are some subtle things men do that show they have a lot of confidence?	Royce da 5’9” gave me the best advice ever. “Niggas sweat bitches while bitches sweat the chill nigga in the sweats.” And that’s a motto I think we should all live by	If they have no problem when other people correct them about something. E.g. if they're stating a wrong fact, and someone corrects them, and then their reaction is polite, interested, and attentive because they're happy to improve their knowledge. Insecure people will be more likely to bluster because their ego is threatened.
How do you compliment girls when you have a girlfriend?	If you’re girlfriend is so controlling / insecure that you can’t compliment another woman, I’d be concerned. You can’t go through this life and pretend other women don’t exist.	If its something you would compliment your mom or grandma on then do that, and word it exactly like you would if you were talking to them. Make sure people see you complimenting others and not women more than men and definitely not specific women over others. I guess you could tell your gf what you are trying to do, as something interesting to share and like a heads up not in a "is it okay if i.." permission seeking way. Good on you for trying to spread the happy feels.
Men of Reddit who felt overly attached to one person from your past, how did your current SO make you forget about it?	You’re supposed to have worked through those attachment issues before getting into a relationship. This is like asking how to safely take your clothes off while you’re taking a bath. Do it before you get in the bath, genius.	On one hand you shouldn't be dependent upon another person to make you forget about a different person. On the other hand, things from our teens can hold onto us pretty strongly. They are our formative years and when our brains make a lot of connections and pathways, and that's why the music we listen to in our teens generally holds a special place in our hearts our entire lives. For instance, I'm 37 and still love Limp Bizkit.
Today my motorcycle broke down and a passerby asked if I had any tools. I said, "I don't need tools because I am the greatest tool in the world." and only later realised that I somehow managed to insult myself. Men of Reddit, have you ever insulted yourself without realising it?	Every guy in r/askmen who talks about pushing their dick down to aim while sitting on the toilet. You've just indirectly said that you are overweight and/or have a small penis.	My husband had complimented me on my soft skin. I said it was my lotion and to use some. He started rubbing it on his body and told me “ I now have the softest cock east of the Mississippi. “
Men who served in a military, what did you do for a living after leaving the army?	Got out 06, applied and was selected as a mercenary for a famous company, got paid $150,000 plus $100,000 for hazard pay. Mainly guard duty along with some assassinations. Free lanced for the local warlord, made about an extra $500,000, but a massacre at a village left a bitter taste in my mouth, warlord not happy, went back to merc, killed a bunch more people, made about $10 million, now retired, living the life.	Air Force sent me to cooking school. 17 year old me wasn't to happy about it at the time thought I was going to be an air traffic controller or computer specialist...(lol) After I got out I went to work as a chef in a large hospital and increased my skills. Stuck with it because hospitals have great pay and benefits but soon realized I had a passion for cooking. That was 20 years ago. Today I am the director of that kitchen I oversee 150 employees and we have an excellent reputation for the food we serve.
Where exactly is the line between having a hard life and just being weak?	When you draw the line, you already took a decision. Fighting daily not to draw the line is the real strength. We all are (mentally) dancing above and below the line. Keep the pace, don't give up and be better than you were yesterday.	I don't think we get to draw the line for anybody else. People fight their own battles; I think they carry their own markers, too. I'm not here to tear apart somebody else's journey. If I can help them, I do. If I can't, I wish them well and go about my life.
How long are you open to waiting for sex when dating someone new?	Until we're married. There's actually no reason for sexual intimacy in a relationship you don't even know is going to work out.	I’d prefer it sooner but I’d be willing to wait if I thought the person had long term relationship potential.
Man of Reddit, How do you stop a porn addiction that ruins your daily life?	Such a big struggle that people overlook and think it’s normal, had a meathead from over r/testosterone arguing with me telling me I’m a loser for not wanting to masturbate and telling me to get some nice pictures and do my thing, it’s not normal to watch other people have sex. That’s weird. It’s addicting and many people like it but it’s not good for you.	When people try to quit a vice, they often retreat into a new one. For a lot of people, this vice is food, but that can be counter productive because you’ll get sad that you’re gaining weight and retreat to the comfort of your own addiction. Find a new outlet for dopamine, something new to keep you busy. Whenever you feel the need, force yourself to the gym. This will help you in the later steps. Do your best to stay in public. Walking around your town, out a coffee shop, where ever. Just dont be alone in your room with a laptop.
How did your S.O break the "fart barrier"?	Normal people don't delight in farting in front of, or on, other people. Children do delight in this, because they are immature and often enjoy behaviours that challenge social conventions. I imagine the vast majority of people don't remember the first time they farted in front of a SO any more than the first time they sneezed, or burped, or scratched an itch. ITT: people with delayed development and poorly veiled scatological fetishes. Just ask him/her to shit on your chest or in your mouth, stop pretending like the ”fart barrier” is a real thing in a relationship or a sign of intimacy.	I don't recall the first time my ex farted in front of me, but I do remember her slow transition from being embarrassed to use the bathroom at my small apartment to being comfortable enough to fart *on me* for a laugh.
Men of Reddit who had very little or no experience with everything that comes with relationships, what were the toughest parts to learn once you had serious relationship ?	Don't get into one,it's not worth it. Remember this saying,"tell a girl something negative,she'll remember forever. Tell her something positive and she'll forever ignore it."	Be honest with how you _REALLY_ feel. Don't accept everything because you are "different" or "nice". Stand your ground, especially when you know what the truth is.
What's your wildest "Lady in the streets, crazy in the sheets" situation?	That doesn't tend to happen in my experience. It's usually either reserved in both situations or crazy in both situations.	She was a 21 year old virgin and grew up heavily Catholic. She wanted it bad, even got sexy outfits. I miss being with someone confident and has absolutely no worries about their body. It was the fire that I miss because now, I somehow attract very sweet yet insecure women. So the thought of having great sex is just a thought.
How is it to have a foreskin?	Myself im not circumcised but I always keep the fore skin pulled back cause having it cover the tip just looks weird to me. Never got used to that look	When you take a shower you can store water in it, it's a useless fact but I just wanted you to know it's possible
Why are/were you not ready for a relationship?	They're just a pain in the ass. You sacrifice your freedom and happiness for the obligation of caring about some jerk and the pressure of their/their families expectations. Who has time for that shit? Particularly since there's plenty of other women my age who are totally down to just bang it out every once in a while with zero pressure for it to be anything beyond that. I'll think about doing a relationship again once I'm in my 30s, and I start meeting women who have been beaten down by the realities of the world enough that their expectations of how much effort I'm willing to put in aren't completely unrealistic.	I really value my alone time but i’m also clingy. I basically want the other person to fit into my life according to my very specific schedule. I know that’s dumb and unreasonable, so until i figure that out i’d rather be single.
What are your stances on paying for a girlfriend's groceries?	If she is going to go hungry, then of course feed her! My wife was hungry in college. If I knew, then I would have given her everything she needed (everything I had). My family had food, I could have packed her a lunch. I could have gave her cash. I spent money on stupid stuff that could have fed her. Now I feel guilty over it. Don’t be me. Buy the girl food if she needs it. Don’t go out and buy warhammer 40,000 army while your girlfriend is eating her friends unwanted leftovers in the university food court. A rice cooker is a great thing!	It's a nice thing you could do, although are not expected to. The points that jump out at me though are- * How comfortable was she asking? A lot of people do this as a last resort and really loathe asking, but some live off it. I'd be suspect that she asked at least.... * It could indicate that she's irresponsible with money
[21M] How to stop being feminine?	A lot of the answers in this thread are simply overly idealistic, or don't understand the reality of the current situation in terms of the world and sex/gender...If being who you are hasn't worked for the better part of 30yrs, it's time to be someone else. This is going to sound contrived, but you'll need to start small. I would suggest watching media about masculinity. MadMen and fight club. Really think about them. Find someone you like. Try to incorporate some minor behaviors. For example... Talking too fast feminine. Spend a month slowing down your speech. Pay attention to the way you stand. Etc.	You can: 1. Start working out and bulk up, and stop hanging out with women all the time. OR 2. Just fucking own it. Hang out with whoever you like to hang out with and behave how you behave. If someone thinks you fit their stereotypical definition of feminine, fuck 'em. You be you.
Many men claim, that they don't like heavy make up, so how come, the heavy make up pic's always get more likes/attention?	More than likely they aren't after the makeup. Seemed pretty obvious what their real end-game goal is. "Maybe if I like enough if her pics I can has the sex." It's pretty sad tbh, but so is uploading pics 24/7 for validation.	I worked with a girl that put on a ton of makeup to contour her face. I didn't think much of it, until I realized that **she was literally painting on cheekbones**. Kind of an interesting way to look at it. I'm sure glad I'm not expected to put on makeup to paint a jawline on myself, what a pain.
How many of you guys can sew? How and why did you learn?	Of course I know how. Learned how to do that and bake in home ec. Wasn't aware this was rare or a secret as pretty much everyone I went to school with learned how to do both to some extent.	I knit and I sew. I learned really to mend my own clothes. Im not much of a fashion person, I just wear what I like and what is comfortable. And I _hate_ clothes shopping. So I'll just wear items until they fall apart enough I can no longer mend it back together without looking like some weird Frankestein's monster type thing. I learned knitting as an excuse to hang with my female friends, they used to have stitch n bitch once a week, knit, gossip, drink. Plus its something for my fidgety hands to do instead of smoking (coming up on year and a half. o_0) I've recently scored a sewing machine, so oiling that and learning to thread and use it is my next thing. Cue the repurposed clothing -> produce bags, etc.
Men who have traded in a high paying job they hated, for a low paying job they love, what’s your story? Any regrets?	Haven’t personally done this, but I’d just keep in mind that you’re only at a job you hate for 8 hours a day, you’re poor 24 hours a day.	I decided to go from a $250k a year to a $80K. I just didn't like the stress and amount of time that the higher paying job came with. I can't say I love the job i'm doing now but it pays the bills and I have to do very little and hardly ever interact with other people. No real regrets and who knows one day I might decide to go back to the higher paying job.
What was something you had wanted to have so badly but when you finally got, didn't make you as happy as you expected?	Getting married was exactly this. Loads of pussy, no bitching, dinner was cooked and served to me at the table. Now I clean 95% of the house 100% of the time..I have to beg like every other married asshole for the kind of sex that I find satisfying..I'm not a fucking missionary. I have to ask if she plans to cook dinner at all on top of doing most of the other chores. And I get the added bonus of having to hear all the bitching about everything I do wrong while simultaneously ignoring what she does wrong. Marriage yaaaay!!	Adulthood would be the low hanging fruit... Owning my own home would be a personal one, don't get me wrong it's much better than renting but unless you are buying new they can seem like money pits. There is always something the partner wants to upgrade or something breaks or gets broken. Still wouldn't give up owning for the world, just I wasn't as excited as I thought I would be even at first, it was just a house that while technically mine is also the banks. God knows how people on average income buy houses in the South of England Edit: to Clarify I live in the UK
Men of reddit, do you believe in "you have to love yourself before you love someone"? If so, why?	If you struggle to love yourself then your personality won't be able to adapt to love someone else's personality. If you can't handle your own thoughts and emotions then you won't be confident enough to handle someone elses.	No amount of external validation is gonna silence the little voice in the back of your head that says "I'm not worthy, they're lieing to be nice, they don't really like me". You have to do that yourself.
Honestly a little embarassing to ask but... How the fuck do you take a selfie?	You don't. Taking pictures of yourself and posting them all over social media in a pathetic attempt to fish for attention and validation is the second most narcissistic thing you can do. I think first place still belongs to masturbation in the mirror.	For the love of god don't take a selfie looking down at your phone! No one wants to look up your nostrils!
How do I stop viewing sex as something that has to be earned by men?	Outside of what mass media and social media likes to espouse as what "should" be, you are experiencing what "is". In short and in general (there are of course exceptions) , women do not make the first move and women want to be courted. This why you feel you have to "earn" it and frankly you should try to earn it. Why would you want to be with someone to didn't make you earn it just a bit?	So I was talking to my partner about this, and it's something we even struggle in within our relationship. Even when they want to instigate sex they struggle to do so, this is a thing that is conditioned on both sides. I do think that there needs to be a re-framing of what's actually going on though. When women have sex the stakes are a little higher, so there is a larger amount of trust needed to be put into the person they are having sex with. You aren't earning sex, you're earning trust.
Attractive men of reddit who are dating a girl who is not considered attractive what’s your take on it?	I and a few of my friends have dated non-attractive girls before. Usually we were in a dry spell and needed to get out of the funk, but sometimes it was because less attractive girls put out easier and are lower maintenance. And for some my friends, they're hot but have no game so they have to settle for less.	I've often dated women who are not conventionally attractive. At the same time, you'd be surprised how malleable people's views of beauty are. If you treat someone who is beautiful on the inside as though they are beautiful on the outside, they start to see themselves that way, and so do other people. Obviously there are limits to this, but I'll take the confident yet goofy girl with a big heart, over the hot girl with no depth and high expectations, any day.
Would you look at a woman's breast when she is breastfeeding in public ?	I think that everyone who would stare at your breasts while breastfeeding is a freak of nature. Or, at least, a BIG pervert. I would never look at a woman's breasts while she is feeding the baby. If I happen to see it, I will just look away. There's nothing wrong with breastfeeding in public.	Knowing me I'd probably freeze like a deer in the headlights until my befuddled the brain figured out what was going on, and then I would awkwardly turn away as soon as I returned to higher levels of cognitive function. Probably stuttering out apologies if I noticed you noticing me
Past my 30ies since a few months, why do i suddenly feel so pressured?	because mid life crisis: where you feel like time is running out, and you never had all the big boxes ticked or you didnt get to do all the things you wanted to when you were younger.	Short answer is 30 is a big milestone that insidiously forces you to compare yourself to other 30 y/os who already have white picket fences, careers, spouses, etc.
Dads, what are pros and cons of having children in your 30s?	I am a 36 year old man with no kids and I have no idea why anyone would want them. Your wife pulled a bait and switch on you. That's not cool.	Pro: you're possibly in a more stable posituon than you were in your 20s. Con: They arent grown til you're in your 50s.
What differences have you noticed in how people treat you when you started to put an effort in how you look?	The day i stopped caring about what others thought about me and just enjoyed who i am... thats what changed everything around. Its your attitude that gets you treated differently. Not the way you look.	Not a direct answer to the question, but I just want to say that when I put effort in, I act differently because I feel more confident and attractive. That in itself affects how people react to me.
Men of reddit, is it universally known that when first dating someone, exclusivity is not common?	Yes, not exclusive until discussed. My GF of 5 years thought we were exclusive from date #1....nope. I saw other women for the first several months.	there is no universal standard. common dating practices are often regional. in some places, people are expected to *only* date exclusively. in others, exclusivity is only expected after a relationship becomes "serious." where sex falls in that also varies a lot.
What's the "smallest" you guys have ever felt?	I am a female but going to provide my thoughts on this... Going to therapy makes you the manliest of men. It takes some real courage to show up as you are and tackle things head on with a therapist. It shows how you value and love yourself so much that you are committed to seeking a life of inner peace and happiness. That makes you a "big" deal and not "small" in a lot of people's eyes. You are doing so great and I wish you well! Ps. Dont ever let people make you feel bad for feeling the way you feel about your issue. You have the right to feel the way you do and you are taking steps to be in a better place. That's already more than what a lot of people could muster.	When the police pulled up as I was being held down and punched repeatedly in the driveway. Bloody, hysterically crying I thought I was now safe. Instead I was instantly forced to the ground and handcuffed and arrested. Even videos of being attacked didnt matter, police literally said we dont care who did what. After a couple hours I bailed myself out. Long story short all charges against me were dropped even before trial, and I got an apology. What I also got was the knowledge that spousal abuse is a one way street. "Shut up and take it you're a man, You'll get arrested instantly if you call, There is no such thing as a female abuser". Really sucks sometimes.
How do I politely tell a guy that I don't want to sleep with him on the first date?	I hate this world. This behavior is normal and don’t let them tell you it isn’t. Why should you *have to* politely tell him that you don’t want to sleep with him on the first, or even second date. These days it seems like they just want to use our body and we are so afraid to be honest about needing more time because we are afraid they will leave. Someone that has suffered sexual abuse I find it impossible to have a relationship with anyone because it’s always them demanding sex before I’m even comfortable with being around them. Men in my experience are way to fast.	Unfortunately, you might have to be straightforward. Tell them you’re not willing or conmfortable on the first night. If you’re still interested in them though, I think you can still tell them how much you enjoyed yourself and would like to go another date. If they keep pushing/pressuring you, end it. It sucks, but you should never feel you have to be pressured into something you don’t want to do. Also, sex does not have to equal being in a relationship. Your friends have the wrong mindset.
Have you ever had a woman be way too into you and it was uncomfortable? How did that work out?	There was a fat girl named Brianna in my high school Public Speaking class who flirted and played around with me. She was 14 while I was 17 at the time. One awkward moment came as I was doing my work and we sat next to each other. She crouched on the floor and looked up at me, saying "I can see up your nose!" That moment weirded me out. She also at one point asked me out to the prom, but I wasn't into her.	Sure, I think everyone has at one point or another. I broke up with someone after only a few months because I was being suffocated, she said 'I love you' after only knowing me for a few days, I would get the infamous '???' passive aggressive texts if I didn't respond fast enough, all that stupid shit. For weeks after we split I still got anxiety whenever my phone would go off.
What is one thing your crush did that immediately turned you off?	She drinks wine like twice every other day I first thought it was fancy/didn’t mind but now I’m genuinely concerned	Ghosted for a bit then returned and then ghosted and repeated. First time was a huge turn off and I was pissed to the point of wanting to block her. But I was lonely so went right back at it each time. Should have just moved on after the first time.
Men who are 50+, what has been your favorite decade of your life so far and why?	My twenties were pretty good in a sick way. I was British special forces, so I traveled the world and killed people. I'm now 61, and these last few years since I was 55 has to be the best. I'm single, my daughter has grown into a beautiful adult human being, (she's 20), and the single available women are sex fucking mad. I ain't complaining.😎😂	When I turned 50 my mother said to me "The '50s are the best decade" and I found her to be correct as I lived them. The '60s are nearly as good, and then in the '70s the downward slope begins as the body wears out very slowly. In the 80s things start to fall to bits a bit.
Dear men, what’s the difference between the non-verbal downwards head nod and the upwards one?	I nod quickly down and back up to signal everythings okay, like when turning water on to a new sink, it means no leaks, its good. If i nod up it means fuck waters going everywhere and its usually occomoanied by a random short vocalization of frustration	Upwards: What's up man? How you doing? Acknowledgement of our knowing each other. Invitation to start talking. Downward: Acknowledgment of respect, agreement, understanding and/or wariness of each other or the situation at hand. EDIT: Thank you everyone for the awards, I appreciate them greatly. And I'm glad we apparently have a near-universal form of communication.
What's the weirdest "Do all men ...?" question you've asked or been asked?	I, a female here would like to know do all men expect a bj during sex? If that is the expectation why is it shocking if I ask for some oral service?	Do guys get together and watch porn and masturbate alongside each other? to this day I wonder how the fuck I might have given her that impression.
How important is penetrative sex in a relationship?	A good partner is going to let his needs, which are actually wants, go by the wayside because your needs are greater and require that. You want to be able to do that, but you can't, which is okay. Focus on yourself, and remember that a good romp doesn't need to be penetrative. You can enjoy oral stimulation, manual stimulation, or teasing. Mutual masturbation may help. You can both enjoy each other in ways that won't require you to have what most people consider sex, but is still wonderful.	In a normal situation, pretty important. In your situation? I can jack off. Your health is way more important. Keep fighting. You got this.
Guys old enough to remember the years before the infinite streaming porn of today: how would you describe it to those who aren't old enough to remember them?	We had to actually interact with women and girls in the context of their being...you know...human beings worthy of respect.	When I turned 18, I got memberships to all the local video stores. Daisy chained two vcrs together so I could record the adult movies onto one 6 hr vhs tape. Had to hide it from my parents. At one point, I placed it inside a Tupperware container and buried it in the backyard to keep my parents from finding it.
Fellow gents, what's the most hurtful thing you've overheard someone say about you?	I overheard my ex girlfriend (who had left me and got with my old best friend since kids) and other ex best friend taking the piss out of me trying to be friends with their clique I got kicked out of, it wasn’t what they said.. more this being the final straw that broke the camels back. Got back at her though, fast forward five years I ended up at a party with her and her friend, I led her on all night then fucked her best friend in front of her :)	Threads like these are why I discourage people from the "nobody ever judges you, really" school of reassurance. If they bank on it, they're always one overheard comment away from their mental defenses falling apart completely. Better to accept that some people are judgy assholes and that their opinion doesn't matter at all.
About what % of your friends met their spouse in their early 20s?	I don't have friends, so that's kinda hard to answer. I married my first wife at 19, finally got rid of her at 27. Met my current wife, and my partner, at 32 and have been with them 25 years. Most of the people that I knew in high school were married and had kids by 21. THANKFULLY, my first wife and I never had kids... If she has gotten pregnant, it would have been by someone else's dick, because I tried to keep mine out of her as much as possible 😂🤣	I think here in Utah it’s a lot different due to the Mormon community. I know people who got married the day after graduating high school. Others within their first year or so of college. I am 23(f) and the majority of the people I grew up with are married (with and without children) and are planning for more children, building houses, etc. Since I am not religious, I got a dog instead.
How do you deal with knowing that most people in your life don't really care about you?	Realizing that is both sad and liberating at the end of the day it's just you. Make mistakes, fuck up, learn, grow and become someone you like	They care a *bit*. You care a bit about the people around you, right? You'd get on with your day if you heard that the guy who checks out your groceries every week had died in a car accident, but you'd think it was a bad thing. Nobody's gonna care about you as much as you care about yourself - frankly, that being the case might be a bit unhealthy for the person in question. But that's okay. Your life is important to you, and that's enough to make it matter. When others care too, that's an extra, something more to appreciate.
What are your biggest dating regrets from your 20s?	I dated, and lost my virginity to, a disgusting obese girl who was extremely immature throughout my 20s because I lived in a backcountry redneck shithole of an area with almost no acceptable women. My biggest regret is staying there and wasting my prime years. I should have moved to an area of culture, intelligence, and fit women.	I met a wonderful woman who was wife material. Unfortunately, I was at that stage where I was interested in fucking around, and could not recognize it. She went on to marry a guy who was good for her. She deserved that happiness, and I'm glad she found it.
Why won’t you just go to / call your doctor when you’re not feeling well?	All these answers, feigning toughness and sticking it out so you don't have to hear bad news. Bunch of pussies. Wanna show how tough you really are? Go in looking for bad news. Ask for that shit. It's fear that makes a man hide from the reaper. True courage is looking the potential of a drawn-out agonizing death right in the eye and walking towards it. Ultimately, get your shit sorted out or stfu about it. Quit complaining about the same ailment over and over if you refuse to get it looked at. You relinquish you're right to bitch when you refuse to do anything about it.	I have a lot of faith in walking things off. I wouldn't budge over a week-long sinus infection, but years of incessant coughing would certainly be a tipping point for me. That's like asking for bad news.
What are some questions you wish you had asked your girlfriend before things became serious?	I'm in the military and I've made the personal decision to not vote in any sort of elections for personal/professional reasons. It came up in conversation because my girlfriend asked me if I had registered to vote yet because I needed to vote for Biden. I was taken aback that she thought she had any right to tell me who to vote for or that Biden was somehow a superior candidate. I tried to explain the situation to her tactfully and she just couldn't seem to understand it. Then I tried logically explaining that having two bad choices with one less worse than the other was not a good reason to vote for the less worse option. Caused a huge fight, recommend you lay your political viewpoints out early because when it comes up it will cause problems if they aren't aligned.	I would ask specifically “are you currently neglecting mental health care and medication recommended by your doctor who has been treating you the previous decade and did you really lose a court case where you stabbed your ex in the chest and ordered to pay restitution and do you still have sex in the bathroom at work with that weird guy Dale you work with”. Honestly would have been a lot easier if I had just asked that up front instead of finding out the hard way.
Men that decided to be single, why?	So I am excluding all the fwb, short terms and casuals since while they were an absolute a blast they are not relevant. Just relationships pursed as long terms: First long term: Ended in loss of attraction and was heading into dead bedroom so I pulled the plug. Next one: Dating was amazing but she was OCD to a pretty extreme level and I absolutely could not handle living with someone like that so I called it. Next one: She was an extreme extrovert and heavy partier and I am pretty introverted, we were mismatched and struggling because of it by the end so she called it. Last one: Both of us work higher end professional careers, she got posted overseas and I didn't want to give up my career so we mutually called it. Otherwise I suspect we would have worked out indefinitely. Current one: Steady as she goes.	I stayed single for a few years after getting divorced. Honestly it was nice to be able to do whatever I felt like doing. Friends going out? I'm there. Wings and beer for dinner? Hell yeah. Work til 7? Ain't nobody complaining but me. House a mess? Only if I'm the one who made it. Play video games all weekend? Sure. Eventually I started dating someone who fits in really well to the stuff I already like to do and decided to marry her.
what was the last compliment you received from a women that you don’t plan on removing from your mind anytime soon?	Why would I remove a compliment from my mind? Is that another way of saying "you won't forget"? I got complimented on my outfit by a couple coworkers today.	"You're a good dad." People (men and women) have said this to me before, but this woman specifically is a closer friend than they are and she had a really rough relationship with both of her parents. Just the way she said it made me feel less like she "was just saying it" and more that she was being honest. Times when I'm at my wit's end with my kid I remember that and it helps calm me down
What are your opinions on spa days for men? Do you think self care on your hands and feet are important?	No, we should stop normalizing consumerism for vanity. A woman always showing off her new nails and eyebrows is a turnoff. A man doing it is worse.	The last time I tried to cut my toe nails I ended up with blood on the floor. So I went to a local salon and the attendant gently removed all the in-grown stuff and did a great job with the rest of the nails. Lots of weird looks from the women customers but I don't care. I'm going to keep going.
What is your biggest, unconventional fear?	The human mind can not comprehend the aspect of “infinity” or “eternal life”. It’s a limitation of mankind. Because everything in the universe that we know of had a beginning and has/will have an end	That I get one of those anaesthetics that make you high for some surgery or whatnot. And my parents and friends sit in my hospital room and laugh at the funny things I say in my delirium and then I say something inexcusable, but everyone thinks that's my real secret opinion, because "drunks and kids tell the truth", and I won't even find out, because obviously nobody wants to talk about it...
What made you realize that your loyalty was being wasted on something/someone undeserving?	She insulted my dad, who is a Coronavirus doctor, to my face and kept going on about how covid was a hoax. Haven't talked to her in nearly a year after being inseparable. No ragrets.	Working in places where they expect you to repeatedly go above and beyond your duties without any hint of a pay rise or promotion.
How do you cope with being alone and unloved ?	It's very unlikely that you're unloved, unless you legitimately have zero friends. But if that's the case, the first thing you have to do is work on why "being alone" is a negative for you. Once you enjoy your own company, and are comfortable in it, everything else will come easily.	Usually, I don't care, but sometimes this feeling comes rushing and then I just mope a bit or in really bad cases, cry myself to sleep.
Men of Reddit, how do you balance how you want to look like vs what "society" wants you to look like?	I never understand why people care so much about what others think about their fashion sense. I show up to school in basketball shorts and some wrinkled shirt. I dont care, im there to have classes not to impress someone.	Where do you live that jeans and t-shirts are not OK for adults? It's standard adultwear near me, certainly in casual situations. You wouldn't wear them for a formal job but they are fine for casual work like mine. As long as they are clean, have no holes and fit well, there is no issue with them.
How do I level up?	Unfortunately I believe that is just an issue with the era we find ourselves in. Due to the older generations of men having been a bunch of evil jackasses, most young men today are afraid of approaching women cause of the stigma of "men bad" that the media likes to propagate.	>How do I level up? Be clear and upfront in what you want and don't settle for less. If you're looking for a relationship and X is looking for something casual, clearly X isn't the right person for you, turn the page and continue searching for what you want.
I know this is a first-world problem but hear me out. What are the non-obvious upsides/downsides to being successful and just staying single your whole life?	Let me start by commending your willingness to take a good hard look at your life. I think it was Aristotle that said the “unexamined life was not worth living.” I’ve been married for 26 years and to say it hasn’t been easy would be a massive understatement. But, until a man learns to consider another person as higher than themselves (that is, voluntarily placing another’s needs and concerns as preeminent to their own,) there is something lacking in that man’s development to full masculine maturity.	I used to know a dentist that stayed single his whole life, and he's been retired for years now, but as a dentist he made good money. Since he was single he could take his vacation whenever he wanted, he'd go grand tour on a motorcycle with some old friends, he'd buy a kick ass audiophile set-up. He enjoyed vast freedom (as you probably do yourself). Some times I think he missed not having some children, but whenever his nieces and nephews came to visit, he always doted on them like they were his own. I guess that's where most people that chose to stay single might have regrets later. Besides not having kids, like some other people have said, it sometimes sucks that you don't have a partner that you can rely on for support, and generally have someone you trust around you.
Autistic men of Reddit, what is something you don't understand about neurotypical people?	Omfg x is upsetting my wife. Clear solution is to fix/stop y. I suggest this. She is pissed because she wants support and this isnt support. Drives me up a wall. We get in big fights about stupid shit and I literally have no idea what the issue is.	My brother is autistic and your first two examples infuriate him. He’s gotten better over the years but I’m not sure this is a autistic/neurotypical issue but just a person to person issue.
[NSFW] What is a dead give-away that a woman watches too much porn when she's in bed with you?	“Squirting” I grew up with sisters who used to clown on guys they dated who begged them to essentially pee on them	Ironically it's the same thing some of the women complained guys did on them - thinking the guy should do his best jackhammer impersonation
When I was young I was always told I was annoying because I talked too much. Now I can't hold a conversation more than 2 minutes because of the anxiety of talking too much and being annoying. How can I be talkative again without being annoying?	You don't want to be, trust me. I have been extremely talkative my whole life; chatting has always been an utter joy to me, but it wasn't shared by the people I'm chatting with. They always seemed uninterested in what I had to say, always just giving me random noises periodically, maybe a monossylabic word if I was lucky. The truth is, people don't CARE about what other people have to say. It's something I've been growing more and more aware of as time has passed. Nowadays, I'm 28yo,and I basically don't talk to anyone. Everything I know, all the things I learn that I think are cool, all the trivia I come across, stay locked away inside my head, and honestly? It has made me less and less interested in learning new things.	Japan had an interesting illustration about communication as a game of catch. The ball should be going back and forth with the same power and speed. You can't only throw the ball, you have to catch it too.
How do you address your partner after they're legitimately mad because you were unfaithful in THEIR dream?	Just let her cool down lmao. She knows it's not real, she's not stupid, but the upset resulting from a vivid dream very much is. Getting all "rational skeptic" and "you and your silly woman *emotions*" on her won't help your case. *If* she starts actively acting possessive and holding you responsible/punishing you for her dream, that's when you ask her to stop and just go cool down. EDIT: I may have come off snarkier than I intended, I guess what I meant in the way of actual advice is **"Let her cool down and sort it out with her once she is calm without invalidating her feelings"**	My wife has had that dream, and she definitely wakes up pissed at me, but once she fully wakes up, she is mature enough to realize it’s a dream and we laugh about it. I’d be bothered if it affected the way she treated me for that entire day (or longer).
Men of Reddit: You’ve had a long and stressful day and you need to unwind. Which activity, beverage and snack/meal will help you with this?	Three 20 mg hydrocodone or 2 xanax bars 5 nips of jack Daniels Tennessee fire, a six pack of Heineken and watching a funny or uplifting movie I never seen before from a hot tub	I usually destress with a nice game of Cities: Skylines, until I have to deal with solving traffic at least
How do I tell our upstairs neighbor that their bed is super squeaky and we can hear it every time they bang?	All most of the answers down below are going to do is to either piss your neighbour off, or egg them on and fuel their ego. I had a neighbour complain to me about my wife and I when we first got together. Ignored them completely. Either start having your own sex and ignore the neighbours, or get yourself some ear plugs. It's not their fault you're not having sex. Trust me, your neighbour knows how squeaky that bed is, and DNGAF. In regards to the squeaks.	>Thinking about leaving a can of WD-40 at their door with a note that says "for your bed." Literally perfect
Do you think porn gives you unrealistic expectations which then leaves you disappointed in bed?	Sometimes. Other times my disappointment comes from a long build up to then really boring sex. I met a girl who really pushed for the long game, I started falling in love with her. I come to find she doesn't moan during sex, doesn't verbally express when she's had an orgasm, doesn't like giving head, and doesn't like doggy style (despite having the ass of a Greek goddess). It really sucks and I don't know how to tell her that I don't think this is going to work out :(	Yes for sure there is no way you can get a plumber same day, that alone keeps me awake at night.
Do you like it when a woman makes the first move?	Yes, for the 100th time, yes. You are boring AF. Since women have clearly told us (through false alligations and metoo, etc ..) that you dont want us to make moves unless its wanted, we stopped doing it, because we dont know if its wanted unless we try. And you know, other men exist, not just the 6' 6" 6figure men, these other men also want to hit it. Its not our fault you think you deserve the best men available, when all you can offer is boring question, nagging and a used kitty. Now its your turn to put on the pants and go out and actively look for a partner.	Honestly we find it flattering. And a relief. Sometimes it creeps me out, like when a 40-50 something woman heckles me while I’m doing my job as a deckhand (I’m 19 for context) but generally we like it when y’all make the first move
