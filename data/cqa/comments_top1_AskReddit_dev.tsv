Trying to start a business. If you could buy a handmade hammock for $30, would you?	I am sorry, but I don't think you will succeed or learn anything from the experience. I predict a wasted 3-6 months. Unless you get bored of it sooner than that.	Honestly? $30 seems cheap for a handmade hammock. Have you done market research with real people? (No offense internet people) but for real, undervaluing a product can be worse than overpricing. People assume an item with a low price (relative to other similar products) is usually going to be poorly constructed with bad materials... But I'd check out mturk, or do real-life surveying to see what most people would pay for that product, before setting a price. I'd also charge more for custom colors. That being said- If I had a tree, I would buy your hammock.
Guys, what kind of compliments do you want to hear from girls?	Recently called edamame "fagnuts" when explaining what a friend had put in a quinoa salad. She laughed her ass off and told me that was the reason that she married me, I understand her weird sense of humor.	I briefly went out with a girl that loves the way I smell. She told me and the compliment was nice but we're still friends and sometimes I catch her sneaking a smell when she's looking over my shoulder or something. No compliment has ever made me feel as good as I feel every time I catch her smelling.
What is something that is morally wrong but socially acceptable?	This may just be a little controversial, but abortions. Edit: Damn, you broke my gold virginity, discussing abortions of all things too.	The bystander effect. It's socially acceptable exactly because of what it is, that doesn't change the fact how horrible it is.
What's something you find irresistibly attractive?	Randomness. She'd come sit on my lap out the blue as I type this response for instance. Burp in my face, etc.	When somebody has a hobby or a subject they just love to talk about, I think it's amazing to listen to people
[serious] Redditors who walked out on their families (went out to "get some milk" and never came back): What were you thinking? Do you regret it later?	When I was in 8th grade(I am now in 11th) I temporarily moved out of my moms house into my fathers. I wasn't sure what to do because we had be fighting for a very long time and I just wanted it to end. 3 years later, and even though it is a regret of mine, I don't know how things would of changed otherwise. It was a very difficult time for me. Both my parents have a tendency to lie to me so I had no idea who to believe. It definitely changed how I view and feel about certain things. This went on for about 6 to 8 months. And I did occasionally spend time with my mom, but it changed our relationship and I'm still not sure for better or for worse.	Dealt with an over-controlling father. I have probably the most boring and lonely childhood. I have no siblings, father worked night shift so I never saw him and the times we could have spent together, he preferred to get himself drunk and watch T.V. I used to pick up cookbooks and teach myself how to cook because I was so sick of frozen dinners. I did the dishes, cleaned the house, mowed the lawn and fixed my own dinner for fuck's sakes. Joined the military after HS graduation and have never been happier. Thanks dad, for teaching me how not to raise my children. My life goal is to be happily married and be the best fucking father to some awesome as shit kids.
[Serious] Ex-cons of Reddit, what advice would you give people going to prison for the first time that people who haven't been might not be aware of?	Bring a few packs of smokes in your butt and don't tell anyone until you're on your range. You'll have a very easy first few days, and avoid packet thieves	I did 8 months in the county justice center. 1) Not everyone is out to get you, relax. 2) Dont relax too much, people will take advantage of you. 3) Learn if you can. I learned Spanish, started learning Russian, a little bit of a trade skill, and enhanced my vocabulary while in. 4) Stay fairly low key (but not a hermit), no one likes too much of a social butterfly.
Afocionados of J. R. R. Tolkien's works, what are some cool/interesting facts about Middle Earth that people who've only seen the LotR movies don't know?	Everyone is talking about the content of the books, but I always thought the context was equally badass, being written at a time well before modern fantasy writing existed, and literally being written in the trenches during WW1.	Sauron's still alive after Lord of the Rings due to him actually being an immortal god/spirit type being. He just exists as a little moody cloud of anger that's too shit to do anything after the ring's destroyed.
What false thing do people constantly assume about you?	That I eat a lot because I am overweight. I am just sedentary. My roommate has to remind me to eat all the time.	Being a Mexican who was born and raised in America, it should have to be that they assume I speak Spanish. I always get funny reactions whenever someone looks to me for a translation and I have to let them know that I'm just microwave burrito.
What quality did your younger self have that you wish you still had?	eidedic memory. That is, I could recall anything I'd read with perfect clarity word for word. Also not having cancer	Loving to read. I still want to read, but I really can't find the time to do it during the day. The only real time I have is after around 10:00 PM and by that time I just want to go to sleep. Then again, I'm on reddit right now while I could be finishing Rainbow Six...
I annoy Craigslist posters when they post cars for $1 by trying to buy them and then arguing when they tell me the actual price. In what small ways do you serve out justice?	I send chain letters to spammers. Any spammer who sends me a message gets added to a list serve, and when I get a new message, I hit "reply to all"	Just bought a used car. I HATE these fucking idiots. Post the mileage and the price. If you don't, you're wasting both of our time.
Reddit, when were the best times of YOUR life?	When I became one of the biggest male strippers in my country. Had packed out shows everyday. Was the biggest entertainment in my country for a while. Sadly I had a major pole accident and had too retire. People still recognise me as Hot Chocolate when I'm out on the town. Although Hot Chocolate is now only a memory for many, but a memory many will cherish for a lifetime.	When I was dating my ex. I have never experienced that constant feeling of euphoria, like the whole world could burn down but it wouldn't matter because our relationship was the only thing I needed in the world. Sadly it didn't last, but that short span of time was the happiest I have ever been.
Women of Reddit: What was your favorite "drunk girl in a bar bathroom" encounter ever?	A Man of Reddit here with a drunk girl in a bar (well, indoor concert venue) bathroom encounter: I was standing at the ice filled trough at a country music concert that was a benefit to bring back the Huntsville Prison Rodeo of all things.... When I look to my right there's a rather attractive drunk girl peeing into the trough standing up. Her jeans were around her ankles and she was "aiming" using her fingers to pull, well up I guess? I stepped back to enjoy the show and her drunk girl friend took my place. A cop immediately walked in that saw them go into the mens room. He also enjoyed the show, then as they finished up simply said "Don't do that again" and let them go on their way. Tl;Dr: Chicks can piss standing up after all. Stop complaining.	I was out on one of my first nights in Europe and chillin in the restroom, waiting for one of my friends to wash her hands( there was a line). I was talking to my friend and my accent was different than everyone elses, so it got some people's attention. I heard a quiet "foreigner!" And then a random super drunk British girl came up to me, grabbed me by the face, and whispered " you are the brightest jewel of all", gave me a kiss on the forehead, and then yelled " never forget!" as her friends pulled her out of the bathroom. Ever since then I like to yell " never forget!" as I'm leaving a room.
what are some psychological facts that people don't know?	More a fact of life. You will either upvote, downvote, or ignore this comment. In a sense, you are under my power.	People naturally like to mimic each other to fit in. When standing in a group of people, try crossing your arms or putting your hands in your pockets and see how many people copy you.
Former overweight people of reddit, How has your life opened up or changed since losing all that weight?	I don't think I could ever lose my weight. During my 5 year anniversary party I hit up my favourite place Fry It Up! These two guys came up to me and said I had the perfect gut. They wanted me to model for Mommy Monthly as a pregnant woman, and when Mommy Monthy Calls, you pick up the phone bro!	As of this moment, I've lost 150 pounds, and I did it in the span of about two years. Besides the obvious - increased energy, bigger sex drive, lots of attention from dudes/chicks that I didn't get before, blah blah blah - the two things I didn't expect were 1) my ass hurts from sitting on a hard surface (apparently my ass fat was serving as a natural cushion) and 2) OH MY GOD THE WINTERS. I used to not understand why my friends were always complaining about how cold it was in the winter, and I'd say "whatever, I don't have a problem, I'm gonna move to Alaska, you guys are pussies." Then I lost the weight, and I realized I'd been relying on being "insulated" all this time. I STILL can't stand the cold.
Who is someone you DON'T like but you RESPECT?	Honestly, (and I'm probably gonna get downvoted for this) Hitler He was NOT good in any way and he deserved worse than he got, but he accomplished A LOT and managed to pull the entire world into another massive war. He also had massive amounts of charisma which is what got him power in the first place. Yes, the world would be better off if he hadn't done anything, but I have to respect how much he accomplished even if it was horrible	There's a guy in my office named Bill. Bill isn't friendly but he's polite. He eats alone because he wants to (leaves the office, never goes into the lunch room). His cubicle has no pictures, no personal mementos. He never speaks in team meetings and doesn't contribute to office potlucks or theme days. He never comes out for after work drinks. He's pretty stand-offish. But my god his work is amazing. If you have a bad client, Bill will deal with it. If you have a tech issue, Bill knows how to fix it. If you have any work-related problem, Bill will know how to solve it. I don't like Bill. Bill has all the respect in the office.
What have your parents done to make you realize you’d never raise your own kids the same way you were raised?	Let my child express themselves the way that they wanted to and teach them that gender is fake. Also they're not going to be exposed to junk food until their friends from school give them some.	Never let me really explain a situation and made snap judgements based on prior behaviour (that happened YEARS ago) with little interest in understanding that I can grow and change as person over nearly a decade.
Drivers of Reddit, what should every new driver know?	Listen to your parents. If they say drive to school and back, do it. I didn't listen. $250 fine, and 5 points later....	Best piece of advice I can give: Assume EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE else on the road is a complete idiot and DO NOT think they will make a certain "action" (turning lights, speeding through orange while they brake at the last second. With this in mind, you can avoid A LOT of shit if you just drive on the safe side.
What is the worst thing you were forced into watching?	Friend forced me to watch Monthy Pyton the holy Grail with him and i was just dying inside. Sorry but i found it just too boring.	my friends dad brought home a bootleg version of transformers called transmorphers. It was barely watchable but I'll be damned there was a titty shot in the movie and I loved it
What is something of yours that you absolutely hate people touching?	I dunno why but I think this is something normal amongst all people. We get very defensive over personal materials that have become specially difficult for us to acquire. That said, I'm really weird. I have NEVER been bother by anyone using or braking anything material of mine. Touching my laptop screen? Sure, w/e that's what cleaners are for. Grabbing my phone? Have fun finding all my secrets. Not like I care really. Drop my expensive coloring pencils and prisms markers? You can pay me back, whenever. It's okay. But touch my daughter....I will rip your nails out with plyers and shove them up your ass and eye sockets. Woah. That escalated	My food. I'll happily buy you a seperate entre, but I hate people eating off of my food. For some reason.
What are some laws that sound dumb but actually have a good reason for existing?	Using your blinkers when you change lanes or make a turn. It is really useful for so other people don't crash into you.	In France, you can marry a person who's already dead. You need to prove that the deceased intended to marry you. It was instated during WWI. It was quite common for soldiers to sleep with their fiancée before going to war. If she got pregnant, he was going to marry her when coming back... except that not coming back was extremely probable. With that law, lots of kids who would otherwise have been bastards (quite a stigma at the time) became war orphans instead.
Parents of Reddit, how did your kids find out Santa isn't real?	I have endeavored to never give the impression that Santa *is* real, and to gently disabuse my son of the notion when he picks it up at school. To me, it's fucking insane to lie to your kids about stuff like this. What a huge betrayal of the trust our kids have in us.	Relevant story: My brother is very trusting by nature, so believed longer than most kids do. He was about to go into 5th grade and my parents were worried he'd get made fun of for believing, so sat him down and told him Santa wasn't real. Apparently he was a bit sad but took it well. He then asked about the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy, and got the answers on those. The kicker though is that after all that, he turned then with tears in his eyes and asked "Mom...is Thomas Jefferson real?"
Redditors, what was your biggest, "I TOTALLY CALLED IT!" moment?	The election of Donald J. Trump. I thought it was pretty clear from the get-go that most Americans hated Hillary Clinton. It was picking the lesser of two evils from the very beginning. Whether they chose correctly is yet to be known. Predicted from day one (non-American here).	I was on post duty in Afghanistan, it was about 4 am in the morning when the typical islamic prayer started playing, which is not unusual. Those of us around the drum fire trying to keep warm went back to bullshitting, and telling funny stories from back home. Suddenly the prayer turned into what sounded like some sort of rant. It sounded like some sort of hate filled speech that someone would give a public in attempt to get them to rise up against their oppressor. This caught us all off guard, and brought the group to an instant silence. I remember saying out loud "Fuck, $20 says we get attacked in 15 minutes." Sure enough, less than 10 minutes later we were taking indirect fire.
Reddit, what's one thing you get irrationally upset about?	When someone discriminates against someone else because of their sexual orientation, like this clerk in Kentucky. Just the type of shit head ignorant personality it takes to be someone like that, I just want to see them get the punishment they deserve. Which she is, and it makes me happy. Edit: Let me guess, I'm getting downvoted by some overly religious douche bag who thinks they have the right to tell someone who they can and can't marry. If so, fuck you. You're the worst kind of person and I didn't think those types were on reddit.	This is rather vague, but people that are oblivious to their surroundings and other people. You know the ones, blocking the lane in the grocery store, unaware that other people might need to get past them, randomly stopping on a busy sidewalk to stare at some random thing, not signaling a turn until they are physically turning. Is it really that hard to be aware?
If I told you lot that "Reddit: The Movie" premiered tomorrow, what would you expect the plot to be?	Fat shut-ins accuse random person of being a bomber because of the color of his skin. When it turns out they are wrong the film completely ignores that plot-line, and turns into a feelgood movie where the main characters give money to charity and fight for freedom of expression. (meanwhile, there's a tiny guy in the corner of the screen during the entire movie going NIGGERKIKENIGGERNIGGERWOMENAREEVILNIGGERKIKEGETMEASANDWICH)	It would be a 2 hour art film with no plot thousands of people standing in a huge white room. They are all gathered in circles, jerking eachother off, talking about different topics. Some circles jerk eachother off while they talk about how shit the other circlejerks are. Once in a while, someone from one circle runs into another circle, just to tell them how horrible their jerking techniques are. This goes on for 2 hours, until someone cuts the power and the whole room turns pitch-black
Younger siblings of reddit, what "game" did your older siblings play with you that was actually just slight torture?	"Lion tamer". My older bro, when he had to babysit my sister and I, would tell us to act like lions in a cage. He was the "tamer" and would hit us with a belt. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Also, he used to pin me down and drool spit towards my face, then suck it back in just before it hit me. Sure enough, after 2-3 times, it'd accidentally hit me. Disgusting. So when he had his very first child, I made sure to have my brother watch as I did the same to the newborn. Only...I made sure not to accidentally hit the baby with my spit. He was not amused. But I felt better, at least.	My older sister used to call me sibling to taunt me as I didn't know what it meant and thought it was a massive insult.
I love waking up a few hours early just to drink coffee and watch the news. Reddit, when did you first realize you were getting old?	Just a couple of days ago, I went to the mall with my little sister and my son (who is still in a stroller). We went to Forever 21. As we came through the checkout line, I was immediately met with complications. The stroller didn't fit through the queue, my son kept grabbing at everything, and I was continuously getting bumped by teenagers and other young twenty year olds. I get to the check out and the girl who was ringing me up looked at the stroller and literally rolled her eyes. It was in that moment that I realized that I am too damned old for this crap. Also- when your conversations move from talking about guys and partying to your child's newest achievements and their bowel movements- that's when you know you're getting old. I'm only 23 by the way.	A few years back, I was bored and turned on the pop station. I felt like I had just come out of a thousand year cryogenic sleep or something. "What the hell is going on? Who are these people? What are these words they're using? Why am I so confused?"
Lawyers of Reddit, what is the most frivolous/dumbest cases you've had to fight for or against?	Not me, but my friend's father is a lawyer, and he said a guy called and said he wanted to sue McDonald's because he thought he heard an employee calling him fat. This was during the morning of 9/11 while it was happening.	I worked for a divorce lawyer for a decade. In the midst of one divorce, the wife (who we represented) wanted us to fight for her to keep a set of commemorative shot glasses that her husband had gotten for a job well done on a project. Her reasoning was that she had advised him from home during that project and he wouldn't have gotten them if it wasn't for her help. No amount of "this isn't right" and "you are wasting time and money" would change her mind. The husband gave her the glasses rather than spend a grand with the back and forth and a hearing. She spent a few hundred though.
What is the weirdest thing about America that Americans don't realise is weird?	Lack of single payer healthcare, a culture of violence and imperialism, and blatant racial tensions brought about by prevailing white supremacism.	You have a two party political system where the two parties do eveything they can to make sure the other party can't get shit done... that just means shit doesn't get done!
What's a popular misuse for any item?	YOLO. People use it as an excuse to do stupid and dangerous things, but i think it shoud be the opposit.	WD-40 is often used as a lubricant, but is designed to be penetrating oil, as a solvent or rust dissolver. Its apparent lubricating property is very short lived.
What's the weirdest rumour you've heard about yourself?	That I've done ecstasy at a party. Never been to a school party and am straight edge so I was very confused lol	I was 18 when I had my first relationship, so I went through a couple of years in high school without one. Someone started a rumour that I was gay, and that this was the reason of me never dating a girl. \( In truth, I was just outright horrible with girls at the time. \) My best friends found this hilarious and they confirmed the rumour everywhere they went, making it even harder for me to find a girl to date. All worked out in the end though.
What screams "I'm educated, but not very bright"?	Useless degrees. Why exactly did you major in gender studies? Edit: I didn't expect to get ripped for this comment.	Trying to introduce studies or statistics into an argument while misunderstanding what they actually mean. Using large words incorrectly (bonus points if said with emphasis). Thinking having a bachelor's degree in some random topic automatically validates all of their political viewpoints.
What movie, that you saw in the theater when it came out, disappointed you the most?	Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Seemed to me like a blatant copy of A New Hope. Was not a terrible movie by any means, but I was really, really excited for a new take on Star wars only to get a recycled copy.	Eragon. I was super into the books when I was younger, and hoped it would turn into a Harry Potter-esque success with the movies. My hopes were dashed.
Why do we register sex offenders, make them known to their neighbors, searchable on maps and whatnot... But we don't do the same for murderers, thieves, dealers, etc?	Because America has an obsession with sex. Probably because half the country are a bunch of prudes that can't get any themselves.	I know in Indiana all violent offenders are registered. Child molestation and related crimes, rape, murder, attempted murder, and I've even seen battery on registry entries with no sexual crime listed.
People of Reddit, what was the dumbest thing you got punished for in school?	Firing a starter pistol off in the library. It was immediately confiscated and I was told to bring my parents in or I would be suspended. I never did and just pretended it never happened and avoided the library for the rest of the year. Never heard another word about it. Would probably be on the news if it happened now a days.	We got 25 questions for homework. I did 24 questions but didn't understand question 25, the teacher gave me "20 lines signed by my parents" for not doing my homework.
People of Reddit, are you aware of the YouTube channels who take screenshots of popular Reddit posts, put a text to speech voice over on them and get millions of views? If so, what are your opinions on them?	So here’s my rules on them: •They must include the OP’s name. •No text to speech. •They must bring something new to the table such as jokes or little skit type things done by YouTubers such as SorrowTV or Soothouse. •They have to do something other than Reddit videos. •They should leave a link in the description to either Reddit itself or whatever sub their video focuses on.	My roommate listens to them every day, and he will undoubtedly listen to this one when it is uploaded. He also conveniently goes by his first initial, so ill say hi, T! If you hear this, it’s your turn to take out the trash.
Programmers, what's the funniest comment you've found in a line of code?	Happened to look at the source code for the popular Team Fortress 2 banking site Scrap.tf Right at the start there's a very, shall I say "interesting" paragraph in the comments. If requested I'll copy/paste it for you guys	//removing this line breaks everything DONT DO IT /**i dont know how or why this works but it does. will figure it out sometime, in the meantime don't touch it */ /** This works as long as the user doesn't input a *. I don't know why and I spent 3 hours trying to figure it out. The below code removes asterisks, because fuck asterisks (temporarily) */
In your opinion, what is society's biggest issue?	The Internet. I feel like the 70's is known for its disco music and peaceful outlook. The 80's and 90's has hiphop and grunge. And the millennial will be forever know as the people who fell apart because they could not handle the Internet.... I like it tho.	Huge lack of ability to be objective about things. I get it, we are not robots, we have emotions that influence how we view things. Lately it seems people completely lose the ability to make rational decisions about things because there emotions completely take over. It's ok to have opinions on something, but people are blatantly denying facts because of there own opinions on matters. TL;DR Facts are facts, you don't get to cherry pick what you think is correct or not, and letting your emotions control how you view things is detrimental to society.
What controversial topic have you not been able to decide where you stand?	As an EU citizen, Ukraine. There is so much conflicting information coming from eastern and western media. I don't really know what to believe. I don't know which is the worst belligerant between Russia and EU/US/NATO. As most civilians, I guess the typical Ukrainian just asks for peace and when I see the mess we've left behind in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lybia and such, I don't think a western intervention is what they need right now. (well, no russian intervention either)	Disposable plates and cups. They sit in a land fill for ever and my little Indian inside sheds a tear. But hey I didn't have to wash dishes today so there's that.
People who didn't have "a passion", how did you decide what to do with your life?	Passion is a funny thing. Everyone I know that had passion? They are no where. "I really like art." Ohhhh... well, drawing pictures really worked out for you, didn't it? What you doing now? Oh, that's right: stay at home mom that puts her meh drawings on Facebook. "I really like music!" Ohhhh... and, I see giving up real jobs so you can tour with your Dave Matthews Band cover band, how'd that go? Oh, still doing that and complaining about greedy rich people and posting about Bernie all day long, eh? "I'm going to make video games." Or, you know... work at a grocery store for 15 years. But, whatever.	Taking the SATs in high school 30 years ago, we had to fill out a form saying what we planned to major in. I turned to my friend sitting behind me and asked what he was going to say. He said Electrical Engineering, so that's what I wrote. Had no idea what that was, but EE turned out to be my major, and my career. No regrets.
Janitors/Cleaners of reddit, what's the worst mess you've ever encountered?	Not a janitor, but when I was young I worked in a gas station. One time I walked into the bathroom to find a kitten that had been raped to death clogging the toilet. There was a condom sticking out of its butthole.	Janitor at a strip club. You learn quickly to convince yourself what you're cleaning is just spit. Spit on the urinal. Spit on the chair. Spit spit spit.
What is something that you do differently than most people, but you believe you have the superior method?	Cooking scrambled eggs. I use eggs, a little salt, some ground garlic, a dash of thyme, a bit of tarragon, a pinch of sassafras leaves, a few drops of lime juice, and a dab of cream. Not to brag, but I've never tasted better scrambled eggs.	Last year I ran out of bowls between loads of dishes so I decided to serve myself some ice cream in a mug instead. Now I do it like that every time. The smaller vessel means I don't scoop as much, plus it has a handle that makes it easier to carry :)
I gave myself a black eye trying to open a ketchup packet. What's the dumbest injury you've ever inflicted on yourself?	I wanted to do a frontflip, from other places then the trampoline. So drunk in the middel of the night I jump up on a bench and when i jumped of the bench i found out that i did not take off well enough so instead of a frontflip i did a faceplant and got a black eye as you did :) Could have been the best youtube video, so said it was not filmed -.-	chipped a tooth, separated my shoulder, and bursitis in my shoulder that turned septic requiring surgery. all from when i hit myself in the face wii bowling.
What are some small things you can do everyday to remind everyone that you're an asshole?	Use a wheelchair because your fat and lazy, not for a medical reason. I shit you not, I was at a concert last night and there was a wheelchair planted on the rail. The guy who owned it used it to save his space and was *walking* to and from the bathroom/bar and also at points would stand during the show. Lazy, entitled, piece of human garbage that is everything wrong with America.	The smallest, but most effective behavior ever, keep clicking a pen. This can go either two ways from here, they ask you to stop, to which you say sorry, then continue after 5 minutes. Or they deem it appropriate and they start doing it too, to which you then say, can you please not do that? Enjoy watching them boil with rage.
Has being a Redditor ever helped you?	Moved into a house with 6 strangers. While awkwardly introducing ourselves and making small talk, I blurt out "Anyone know when the narwhal bacons?" First, I was greeted with disappointing silence until they all yell "Midnight!"	I read the AMA about a guy who was a professional arcade gamer at Dave and Busters, which sparked a trip to D&B. He mentioned in one of his replies about the way to win at the Spin and Win game, and I hit the jackpot twice.
What screams I’m desperate for attention?	Men with man buns. Hipsters with shaved sides of their head and a beard with that stupid combover look Chicks with bright red/pink/blue hair. Now get off my lawn!	*texts someone to hang out but they say they’re busy.* “WTF I can’t trust anybody! Why can’t I ever make ReEaAl friends?! Why is no one ever willing to hang out with me?!” *Deletes social media for a solid 20 minutes then reinstalls*
Overthinkers of reddit, what do you assume was the worst thing someone has said behind your back?	I got a pixie cut and was sure that people tought I was a lesbian. In my defence someone did ask that from one of my friends	When I was in high school I went on a school trip with five or six other students. I ended up falling asleep and had a dream that they all talked about how much they hated having me come with. It was one of those dreams where everything said was somehow the worst possible thing imaginable. Eventually I woke up. The girl next to me asked how my dream was and as I started to tell her the look on her face made it clear I wasn't dreaming.
What conspiracy theories do you believe in?	White people are purposefully being bred out of existence. The saddest part is that they have created a generation of whites who don't even care that their culture, history, unique features, etc are going to go away.	Whenever this question comes up in this sub someone always mention alleged child abuse circles among elites especially in the UK and USA. I belive that is true and child abuse is very common problem in political and entertainment circles.
Managers, what were some strange reasons for firing an employee?	Yes to both, it is part of the job and he read and signed a document stating that he understood it. But easy come easy go.	I'm not a manager, but my preschool school director fired an employee on her first day because she put an infant outside, alone because "he was too loud."
What is the most brilliant marketing strategy you've ever seen?	Well, the GOP managed to convince the working class that supporting tax cuts for the rich and the destruction of worker protections was their better option...	Apple's original iPod is hard to beat. When they originally created it, most portable audio devices were black. By making it white, it stood out completely. Remember the commercials? They were just solid colors of dancing people with the white iPod. GoPro has also been a marketing force.
Tech/IT people of reddit! What is the biggest mistake you've made at work?	I used to work at a computer refurbish company. I was trying to install ram into a computer and forced it down and damaged a bunch of pins in the ram slot. I secretly swapped computers and ended up doing the same thing and had to tell a supervisor that someone before me ruined it and it was like that when I opened the computer.	We were testing out our new phone system and it appeared to let you set different hold music per site. So we loaded up Rick Astley for our hold music. A day or so later we're talking to several people on speaker phone at another site when they mute one of the phones they were using and suddenly.... *never gonna give you up*... The MD in the room got all snide about the stupid 80's hold music, the assistants are confused, and we are on mute laughing our asses off. So yeah, I rickrolled the hold music on our whole phone system. Might have to turn it into a yearly April tradition.
Now, what is the worst thing you've ever caught your PARENTS doing?	Caught my dad running this massive weapons of mass destruction operation. I was a rogue agent and when I found out it was him he cut my hand off. Fucking asshole.	I caught my mom smearing a combination of bacon, eggs and syrup on my gagged and tied up dad while yelling "HOW'S BREAKFEST IN BED, BITCH!".
Reddit, what's the most awkward situation you've found yourself in while with a friend's or significant other's family?	Edited for clarity. I was at my boyfriends house when we first started dating I had never had to meet a mom before so I was incredibly nervous. His dad told a story about how they used to go to the beach every summer and how his wife was the most beautiful woman on the beach. Which I thought was the sweetest thing. She says "I was fat!" and he's like no you weren't and she's like "I was ### pounds" and I said "well you look great now" and she said "well that's because I'm anorexic." My jaw dropped and I felt like I could hear the crickets outside. I just said the first thing that came to my mind which was "wow that's a bummer". I think she laughed but I still felt like a total idiot.	My ex boyfriends grandmother was in and out of the hospital for various ailments (both real and imagined) during the time we were dating. She also developed Alzheimers and went from being extremely lucid to fearing that she was going to die at any moment. We went to visit her in the hospital once and the moment I walked in she grabbed my hand, stared straight into my eyes, and told me that they were all trying to kill her. She begged me to look inside of her vagina for the probe that they had inserted to spy on her. Awkward doesn't even begin to describe that conversation.
May need throwaways: Reddit, what's the most scandalous or shocking thing about your employer that might interest us?	He rapes, kills, and eats children. And it's actually not a job, it's a Congressional internship. Please keep this on the DL though, Reddit.	I used to work at a Toys R Us in ...a random Canadian city, we were located above a large grocery store in a mall. Every night the candy at our store would be raided by the vast quantities of rats that lived in the grocery downstairs. Needless to say, we always had our candy priced low to get it out the door before the rodents got all of it.
Dentists, what was your WTF moment after you looked into someone's mouth?	One day a regular patient of ours came in, all seemed normal, pleasantries were exchanges but later on in the day I was going to a life altering amount of poor hygene. As soon as they sat in the chair and uttered an ahh at my request, I saw that since their last visit most of their teeth had been nearly rotten all the way through, not even kidding, I swear one of the back molars was hollow. Long story short they now need dentures.	Dentist for 34 years, father of this users account here, about 20 years ago this lady came in to the office asking to clean her teeth. When I looked into her mouth on the inside of her lower front teeth she had so much tartar that there was no gums around the teeth. Only the tartar kept her teeth in her mouth. When you do dentistry, you see some shit...
Employers/hiring managers/HR people of Reddit has anyone ever given you a reference that ended up costing them the job? If so what happened?	I was hiring a receptionist. I called her reference she was an old manager. She just said your hiring her good look with her showing up and hung up.	*I* was the reference that cost someone a job. This dumbass was my roommate's boyfriend. I hired him on at my shop because he needed some extra cash. He barely worked for the two months he worked for me. Like most of our lazy employees, we just phased him out rather than fire him. Anyway, he applied for a job in his field at a petroleum engineering company or something. It was a management position and he needed management experience. He put himself down as *my* supervisor. Well they called me because they wanted to know what it was like being managed by him. I thought it was a mix up and they said "no, he put himself down as the manager of the shop." Yeah, no. I told them that was a straight up lie. He didn't get the job.
What is a negative fact about a historical figure or famous person that most people wouldn't know?	George Washington was actually a serial killer. In the late eighteenth century, he was suspected to have murdered multiple farmers, including his cousins. He was pardoned after his service in the french and Indian war, and you can imagine why he was so successful there. Many people believe that this is why the Free Mason's gathered a ton of support in that time period, solidifying them as the secret society that runs our country.	After JFK was killed, Jackie Kennedy sat down for a long taped interview. Apparently, some of the things she said about her time in the White House were so shocking that she demanded the tapes not be released until 50 years after both of her children have passed. EDIT: People commenting about the book Caroline released about the tapes, it only showed a portion of them, and Caroline herself said that.
What humanized someone you always thought was a jerk?	This is really random, but hearing Jacob Rees-Mogg on some of the interviews he's done. He's able to laugh at himself and make jokes in a way I don't think any far-right American politician could. He's still a prick, but in terms of personality, i'd take him over anyone in the "Freedom Caucus." For real though, he could be Time Magazine's Man of the Year 1790.	My mullethead boss saved me from a firing after I crashed a machine when I was a new machinist. I heard it from another very cool older journeyman. I realized he had only been teasing me and actually liked me as an apprentice. I thought he hated me. I started teasing him back and we became friends. He understood I was poor and just starting out, so he helped me get all of my tools at discount. He just came off as a jerk with a mullet, but he was actually a good guy- with a mullet.
If you could find out one statistic about your life so far, what would it be?	I always wonder how many hours I’ve spent staring in to the mirror and licking my own toes. Believe me, it must be a lot of hours. Also, maybe the measurement of saliva that has slobbered over my feet in litres.	When I was naming my kids, a number of the names we were considering were thrown out because either me or my wife knew someone by that name and our experience with them made using their name akward. Like they were the smelly kid, they were bullies, had a crush on them ect. I always wanted to know how many people considered my name as a potential child's name, but eliminated it because of me.
What life lesson have you learned from videogames?	The importance of time well spent. You should play games at most for a few hours a week. Anymore and there is serious opportunity costs of time that could be spent doing more rewarding things.	No matter how good you are in single player, you’ll look much, much worse when you compare yourself to other players online. Every fighting game ever.
What's your greatest gaming memory?	well maybe my best gaming memory was back in 2010, I rember i snuck down to my fathers bedroom and i took his laptop from his bed, then to sneak up to my room again and play cod 4, back at dat time i was a god in cod 4 it was my favorite game and still is to this day, but i can't really enjoy it as much as i did back then, idk why but if someone feel like me please let me know.	It's gotta be those multilayer war stories. You know that one game of Halo 3 where you carried the team against all odds? Or fighting off the entire enemy team in Search and Destroy CoD, using all your ammo and then finally knifing the last guy while your team cheers. Definitely those organic moments that no one could script.
What hobby instantly makes any stranger 100000x more interesting and enjoyable?	Smoking, Seriously. I love hearing people's high stories, how they roll joints, their favorite strains, what their pieces look like.	Cooking. I can't tell you how often telling women that I love to cook has gotten me a successful second date because "men don't cook". The same goes the other way around as well, if a woman can cook, it makes her that much more interesting and attractive.
People of Reddit, what is something you deal with daily that the other gender will never understand?	Feeling that every guy that talks to me is only attracted to my body and doesn’t actually want to be friends. It fucks with my confidence and makes it so I dont trust any guy actually wants to be friends and it just makes it all the harder for me to make friends. Edit: changing knowing to feeling	Being in a room full of people and panicking because you aren't sure if it's your period or just random discharge.
Married people of reddit, what was your first impression of your current spouse?	Like I didn't get enough of these kinds of bullshit questions from my wife? I don't know what the hell my first impression was, I can't remember what I had for lunch two days ago. Isn't it enough that I remember to pay the bills on time and don't fuck other people??	"Wow, that kid has a huge head." And I don't mean his ego. His head is large for his body, like a Peanuts character. Whatever. I love him.
Get your throwaways out. What is the most politically incorrect belief you have and how do you justify/defend it?	I don't like Asian people. I have a natural prejudice against them. I justify this by telling myself it's there culture I dislike. I realized this when I made friends with two asian friends at work(who weren't friends with each other). I found out months later that they were both adopted by white families, explaining OF COURSE why I enjoyed their company, but not my other asian coworkers(not that I DISLIKED them, but I didn't actively want to spend time with them outside of work). TL;DR Asians have small penises and should go write me a concerto or do math or something.	I think it is healthy to judge people, but it is unhealthy to perpetually be acting on them. I think it's a natural part of a humans evolutionary survival skills.
What is the juiciest subreddit to binge read?	/r/latestagecapitalism. The mods on that sub would qualify as "severely mentally disabled" if they ever got tested. The average poster there is troglodytic in the extreme. It's a complete shitshow, but great if you just want to giggle at imbeciles for a while.	r/HobbyDrama - It started out as an AskReddit question "What's the drama going down in your hobby right now?" and it turned into probably my favorite AskReddit question ever. Someone started a sub while it was at its peak and while it's slowed down as a sub, it's still awesome. You'll find everything from KPop to Magic: The Gathering to local knitting communities to whatever, it's great.
Redditors, what is the worst 'life hack' you have ever tried and have you ever tried one with terrible consequences?	It's too stupid to explain. TS;DK: Never replace going to the doctors with a pen-knife, duct tape and vinegar kids. Or you'll have a permanent scar...	Tried that one that says "putting tea bags on your eyes depuffs them!" when I was about 13. However they did not specify black tea, so my dumbass uses an apple cinnamon tea. Cinnamon is a minor irritant so I had red tea-bag shaped rectangles around my eyes for a few hours
[NSFW] Plumbers, pizza delivery guys, etc - did your job ever turn out as in porn? What happened?	You won’t believe this but I delivered pizza to an address once. Every last woman was bent over. Begging for it. I gave it. Miss delivering pizza to primary yoga classes, though. Stupid whitey.	I once showed up to a customers house to install an alarm system. The first thing out of the customers mouth was “we are not having sex today”. I responded “.....ok”
Last night my flatmate nearly killed everyone living in our flat. What would you do? What should I do about it?	I would laugh, and tell the occasional story about how my drunk roommate almost killed me to people while drinking.	You need a concentration of around 10% natural gas to air in your house to become flammable, but a concentration of over 15% will not ignite. So when you smell gas, don't touch switches, open windows and doors and get outside for an hour or so. How do I know? Electrician and gas heating technician.
Real or not, what's a 9-5 job offer you would accept right away?	A billioner? Or working in brazzers Man toy for 20y old beauty? I will hate all of them on some point.	I would like to be paid to attend university without the exams. Being paid to learn without the pressure of assessment is a dream.
What made you famous amongst your friends?	There was like ... a decade ... where poker addiction ran strong in our group. A weekly tournament and grillout that usually drew two tables worth of players. Weekday bar poker in the satellite games at like 3 different spots that yielded points into the league. Weekend trips to casinos around the midwest when we got wind of random tournaments. And of course the occasional trip to vegas. I earned the nickname "gamblor!" for getting blind drunk and making it to heads up play, passing out at the table, going all in when poked, and then having mother fucking quads. I did it ***seven times***. One guy refused to play heads up with me any longer and would just chop it if it was me vs. him. lololololololol.	I have a moderately unusual name, and when I was in high school some asshole with the same name as me went around writing it on everything. So every time I met someone new they'd be like "Oh! You're that guy!" Even my grandmother saw it somewhere and got mad at me for it. Fuck that guy.
Ex-suicidal people of reddit, what saved you? And what keeps you going now?	I learned at 19 that your first love isn't necessarily your last, and that I'd have another chance to go to school after dropping out the first time. I learned that I would be able to find a high-paying job that I love. I didn't understand any of these things. I thought I'd be stuck the rest of my life with a shitty job, shitty man, and no higher education- turns out the world is my oyster! The Universe gave me another chance and I took ahold of it and will never look back. Be well, OP.	Realising that there is no one technique that is guaranteed effective. What's worse than committing suicide? Getting it wrong, ending up disabled and unable to do anything for yourself again.
What made someone the weirdest teacher that you will never forget?	My highschool chemistry teacher. Had a funny way of punishing students he liked. Once, I 'forgot' to finish my homework. He made me stand by the corner of the class where, coincidently, the dustbin was. Throughout the rest of the class, he scrunched up bits of paper and threw them at me at 10 minute intervals. Great guy	Grade 6 Sex Ed Teacher. Prize quotes: "I'm not going to talk about masturbation, you can use a doorknob to learn about that." "Sex is like coffee. Sometimes you have to have a lot before you know what you like. Right now I know I like mine strong, dark and hot." We were 11 years old.
Who is the most despised member of your family and why?	First Aunt. She owns about 30 guns (we are a very liberal and anti-gun family) and decided to loot my grandmothers house after she was put into hospice care. This was my mom's side btw	My uncle Gus molested both my aunt and my cousin, and he's been in prison for awhile but he's out now. The whole family has disowned him and nobody has seen him since before he went to prison the first time. The last time I was around him, I was 4, and I was running around my house and he exclaimed "She looks just like her auntie!" And my dad threw him out of the house. The second time he went to prison, it was because he was catfishing a 14 year old girl online. His wife was in on it too, the girl would call his house and his wife would answer pretending to be his mom. We don't talk about him
What are your blasphemous musical opinions?	Lady Gaga is a talentless hack who relies on gimmicks and Prince's music sucked so nothing of value was lost when he died.	Ever since the whole clear channel shit in the mid 90s, we're for the most part being spoon fed "hits" that have been pre chosen and have increasingly less musical merit as a lot of have been written or ghost written by the same small pool of producers. But throw it on a commercial bumper for a movie or good morning america and it's an instant fucking hit. So shut up and dance w- .... FUCK!
What popular movie has the biggest plot hole in it that no one seems to notice?	Independence day Computer nerd to the rescue muthaFUDGER! I got this virus for these aliens that'll fuck em up. But Goldblum, how will the virus be downloaded? Don't worry, I'll PLUG MY MAC INTO THEIR SYSTEMS	Either a plot hole or really stupid plotting: In TDKR, Bane breaks into the Gotham stock exchange in broad daylight and steals trading codes or some shit. The next day Bruce Wayne apparently makes an inexplicable stock purchase that threatens to tank Wayne Enterprises. Bruce is then thrown off the board in a 5 minute meeting - during which, no one brings up that maybe the masked terrorist who hi-jacked the stock exchange literally hours ago had something to do with it.
What are the downsides to dating you?	Never around. I live with grandparents and have no car, but go to college. Out of respect I don't stay out past 9. If you want to see me you have to pick me up and bring me back every time.	I'm not the best talker. I have my days when all the planets are aligned and somehow my brain just clicks together - I can be as witty and charming as I want. But on most days my brain is just a blank.
What doesn't seem racist but actually is?	Affirmative Action. It is actual, literal, institutionalized *blank*-ism. I would feel so insecure and worthless if I benefited from it, personally.	For government compliance I need to read a lengthy disclosure to my customers. To sum it up it basically says, to prove to the government we aren't being racist, what race are you? You don't have to tell me if you don't want to but if you don't I'm required to make a guess based on skin color and last name. And your ethnicity please? Oh did you say Dutch, we're looking for Hispanic or latino here. I always feel I little racist reading that.
When did you realize you needed to turn your life around?	I held my daughter after she was born. I finally realized what actual love felt like. I didn't feel it for my wife (her mom) or anyone else really. That was 24 years ago and marks the defining turning point in my life. I pursued relationships with people I love and that love me back and it has been amazing...not always easy, but amazing.	When the buttons on my XXL shirts were almost popping off. It was either lose weight, or buy bigger clothes like I had in the past. I chose to lose the weight. That was 5 years ago and I haven't gone back. Edit: My first gold! Thank you anonymous Redditor!
Liberals of reddit, what are some conservative viewpoints that you can actually appreciate?	At 55 years of age I have seen 'conservatives' take every 'liberal' principle, viewpoint or policy and turn it into some mean, vicious, thumbscrew for the rest of society. What I can appreciate is the single minded dedication to their viewpoint. I am neither 'conservative' nor 'liberal' as neither offer anything other than bouncing from being 'conservative' to 'liberal' or 'liberal' to conservative.	I appreciate how they want to cut down on government spending. I don't appreciate that they cut down on social services instead of military activities.
What's something you're proud to say has never happened to you?	I have never had Reddit Gold It just sounds so stupid, it only adds a few little things that don't really changed Reddit at all EDIT: Reddit gold? Goddamit Kevin	You know, last time I tried answering one of these questions, my response was "Broken a bone." One week later I broke my ankle in two places. So I ain't sayin' shit.
Was there ever something you didn't like, not because it was too bad, but because it was too good?	Well, I play a lot of Magic: the Gathering, so I dislike a lot of cards because they are too good.	Sour Skittles. Jesus, my mouth puckered up like an anus, but they were delicious. I had to stop eating them because the lining of my mouth started to peel.
What is something you don't understand about people?	I don't get trends. I really dislike some of the modern trends like dubstep, mobile games, Starbucks, Apple, etc.. It just feels fake and empty to me	How oblivious people are. My friends can stand in the middle of a path and not realize that they are blocking people's movement. I always try to get out of other people's way when I'm standing around.
Ex bullies of Reddit - where did you end up and how do you feel about what you did?	Not me but my bully is crazy now and obsessed with Aliens and other crazy stuff from what I can see on Facebook. I now suffer from PTSD and flinch every time someone raises a hand.	Was bullied heavily, clawed up the social ladder to a rung above the bottom, picked on the bottom rung. Apologized down the road via Facebook but never heard back. I regret my actions and wish I could be forgiven but I get why I wasn't. I was never physically violent with anyone. I was just mean-spirited, and shitty to a couple people. They know how I feel and I hope that's some small consolation. It's more than I deserve.
[Serious] People involved in incest, how did it affect your relationship afterward?	I had a three way with my girlfriend and her identical twin sister. It was surprisingly very open and they were really cool with it. They have a very chill relationship with each other. My girlfriend and I have never been closer. 10/10 will do again...	I dated my best friend for a while until his dad caught us making out and told us that we were cousins. We didn't believe it at first but my dad is a genealogy buff so we asked him. Sadly, 2 generations back there was an inheritance dispute in which my side kept the family name and his changed theirs to an alternate spelling of our great-great-great grandma's maiden name. We tried to keep in touch for a while but it always felt weird and different. Haven't spoken to him in about 4 years now but I'm sure we're cool. Edit: I'm sure this isn't as scandalous as you were hoping, but it was my experience with incest.
For those who have slept with celebrities - was the experience as fantastic as you had imagined?	It was glorious. Everything went amazingly, just as I would imagine. Except for right after, she so gently whispered in my ear," I'm gonna need about tree fiddy". It was about this time when I realised she was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.	A girl I know once brought John Mayer back to her apartment. They were making out and out of nowhere he decides he wants to take a shower. So they both get in the shower, and then he asks her to describe her biggest sexual fantasy. As she's talking, he starts jerking off while staring into her eyes. After he finished, he got out, put his clothes on, and left.
My (ex) boyfriend had his mother call and break things off between us, instead of doing it himself. Reddit, what stupid ways have you been dumped?	I got dumped in high school with a note (I was about 15-16 at the time). This was also before cell phones were *everywhere*. He couldn't even do it to my face. The note wasn't even delivered by him either! It was a friend of his who gave it to me. I got back at him by telling some of his friends when his birthday is. I got the stink eye for that. No regrets.	We lived in separate states and made the decision to move in together. She was under contract at her job, so I bit the bullet. I applied to a school in her city, saved up money, quit my job, packed up my car and started to drive the 11 hours to a new life. She ended it when I was on hour 3 of the drive.
Rich people of Reddit, how did you make all your money and become rich?	Well I'm a white heterosexual male so it was just given to me without any effort. I believe it was taken from minorities in some way but I'm cis so of course I don't care.	Started a few companies, worked on them for 3-10 years, and they all succeeded somehow. Car exporting, Real estate, and driving tours.
What's something unconventional everyone should try out?	This isn't unconventional but **learn an instrument.** When I was a teenager, I played the piano pretty casual but never really got that into it. It wasn't until I turned 20 and I had a few hundred bucks that was burning a hole in my pocket that I decided I'd try something else. So I bought my first acoustic guitar and it's been a real passion of mine since. I've gained a new appreciation for music, especially string instruments. Fuck your Macbook music and fuck your amplifier, man. It's all about the masterfully constructed wooden box with strings bolted onto it.	Go on meetup.com, find a group founded on something you like or something you've always wanted to try, and go to it. I never played a sport in my life then I ended a long relationship and was just desperate to try something new. So I got on meetup and picked a random thing happening nearby, which was an open gym for foam dodgeball. A year later, I have played five seasons on the local league, won a first place medal, and made a diverse group of friends.
Fast food employees of Reddit, what shouldn't we order?	I've worked at many fast food restaurants throughout the years. You shouldn't order anything. Low pay and low moral means that workers are way less likely to do their job properly, and they tend to slack when it comes to proper food handling and sanitary procedures. Of course, this varies and is usually prevented in stores that have good management.	Also at Culver's, if you're lucky you may get a cheese curd in your bag of fries if we don't notice it when we scoop them into the bag.
When I was little, I wrote "Sonic The Hedgehog" on a floppy believing that was all I needed to do in order to play said game. What stupid shit did you believe as a kid, Reddit?	i thought some old man in the sky was judging me, taking notes of all the bad shit i did, just waiting to dish out the punishment. just sittin there on a cloud shaking his fist at me. "Damnit Choast!, your mother said that money was for lunch! stop buying rubber band guns!!"	In the early Fifa football game series for the PS1 there was a option to play a round of 'Sudden death'. I thought that if i clicked on it I would be instantly killed.
What strange habits have you picked up from your line of work?	Former CO. Always had to sit where I could see the door in a public place. I'd constantly check to make sure my wallet was in my pocket (Carried a badge wallet inside with a prox card). I swiped my wallet at doors in my own home(prox card). I suspect every man I see with a child is a pedohile.	As an ER nurse, I tend to examine everyone's arms and hands to see what size IV I'll put in,
What was the worst job interview you've had?	Lady had massive cleavage and while I tried my best not to look, she busted me numerous times glimpsing at the sun. It just wasn't fair.	The interviewer insisted on knowing why I'd left graduate school. Now, I had left graduate school because my advisor died in a car accident and the whole small department was thrown for a loop and no one seemed to know or care what was going to happen to me or my just started research project. The asshole interviewer wouldn't even accept "My advisor died suddenly" and dug into the gory details until I was almost in tears (even intimating that I must have had "feelings" for my advisor.) I couldn't wait to get out of there and in my haste to leave I knocked some solutions off a cart (which had no business being in his office BTW) on my way out. I'd never been so humiliated in my life. After that, I was sure I'd never get a job in science.
Today a kid at my school was expelled for masturbating in class. What's the most ridiculous thing someone has been expelled for at your school?	When I was in year 4(not sure what that is for Americans), I called one of the kids in my class gay, he then proceeded to pick up a metal chair, start crying and throw the chair at me. Me being the badass that I am, I dodged the chair and it hit the classroom door and shattered it, needless to say, the kid got sent to the principal's office and was subsequently expelled. Not really too ridiculous but still funny nevertheless.	Smoking a joint in class. I mean seriously. This kid rolled and smoked a joint. The retardation level was off the fucking charts.
Is suicide an evolutionary mechanism?	No, one of my ex girlfriends was the smartest girl i have ever known she came out of school with 9 a stars and 2 a's. She was incredibly talented, beautiful, she was better at most sports than i am so genetically she was almost perfect. she killed herself because of a boy.. Suicide has no reason, it just happens and it's horrific.	Based on my complete lack of expert knowledge, I think suicide is a side-effect of intelligence. Intelligence is a survival strategy that works for our species, but it also makes us individuals aware of our own mortality. Not to say every animal that has caused it's own death has been aware of it's own mortality, but humans kill themselves with alarming frequency.
Self-made millionaires of reddit: what was your first "fuck it, I'm now a millionaire" purchase?	Won the lottery for 26 million, after all the bullshit I got a small sum if it. Anyway I donated $200,000, a few phone calls later I realized I had made a huge mistake.	An umbrella policy. Much later comes feeling OK about nice meals, tipping large, thinking about nice toys. One of the parts about self-making is spending a long time poor or insecure or at risk along the way. Security and stability for yourself and those that had the courage to stick with you through the bad times is (or should be IMO) much more important.
Redditors who got engaged but it didn't last till the wedding, what happened?	We were engaged for a couple of years. My boss always made fun of me because of it. My fiance said that we were waiting because we had to save up. After all, I'm just a receptionist and he's a warehouse worker. Eventually I fell for a guy working in my same Office. His name is Jim. Now we are happily married with kids.	Together for 8 years, engaged for most of that. We were high school sweethearts. We were happy, bought a house together but eventually just grew apart. It was an amicable break up and we're still friends. It just became apparent that we wanted very different things in life.
What's a skill you've learned that has improved your daily life?	make use of simple phone instead of smartphone , no selfie , no movie , no social media , no internet , only receive important calls and text ;)	Saying no to people. Don't feel bad about saying no, it's better than saying yes when you're not comfortable with doing something, and you don't make excuses on why you can't do something.
Why can't a notable and respectable figure from the Muslim world step up and explain that the film was not made by the USA, but by specific people only seeking to fan the flames of hatred?	They're xenophobic bastards. Most of the Muslim world hates America but we are too afraid of being characterized as culturally insensitive to take on their fundamental beliefs. Did you know that Muslims enslaved far more Africans than the Europeans? They still practice slavery in many forms in the Middle East. Most Muslims have fairly horrible attitudes to natural human rights. I don't advocate war but fuck them. Leave them alone and let them die of their own stupidity.	One notion you need to abandon is that the violence is a reaction to this video. In mere seconds with google you can find 100 more anti-islamic videos that are far more offensive, or any other sort of content that is highly offensive to anyone of any belief system or creed. People serving thier own misanthropic anti-american interests have just picked one out of the barrel and whipped up a mob of idiots into a riot.
Today I saw a father calmly leading his son as if he were blind. Why? The child had had his head buried in a book. What other examples of patience and good parenting have you seen recently?	I think you can encourage your children to read without catering to them to this degree. There is a time for walking and being observant, and there is a time for reading. A crowded train platform is _not_ the place. It's a cute story, but a bit eye-roll-inducing, if you ask me, which you didn't.	My father used to keep a pack of markers next to his bed so on weekend mornings when we would wake up and crawl in bed with him we could entertain ourself by giving him "tattoos" while he caught up on sleep. He'd snooze away- he's a farmer- it was a rarity, and let us draw all over his back, legs, arms, stomach. Then, when we finally covered him he'd wake up, walk to the mirror and admire all of our markings with pride.
What sounds like good advice but isn't?	Basiically _books good, phones bad_ I love reading. But there's so much unfounded, partial, imprecise and absolutely toxic shit printed out there, that you have the same chances to find something "good" there than in your phone.	"Want that job? Just keep calling to check on the position. It ingrains you in the hiring manager's mind and makes them consider you more when your resume makes it to the top of their stack." How it *really* works: The manager goes through the stack of resumes, finds yours, and throws it out. Then sends you a polite rejection email. You're meant to think the squeaky wheel gets the grease, but in reality, they just replace the wheel.
What's something people glorify, but really isn't that amazing?	I've seen a lot of people brag about their ability to eat spicy food. Congratulations, you come from a culture that needs to cover up the taste of poor-quality meat.	Overworking yourself. It's not healthy, it's not fun, it ruins your life and the lives of the people around you (friends, family, etc). People deserve to have a break.
What is something you hate that so many film makers seem to do?	Cast Jessie Eisenberg. Dunno what it is about that dude. I just can't take to him. Decent actor but fills me with rage.	I hate how much clipping there is in fight scenes, chase scenes, etc. I guess I don't know the technical terms, but I hate how chopped up everything is. Constantly changing angles and distances. It's just disorienting to be teleported all over the place and then suddenly you're, say, watching the protagonist fall out of a window but you didn't even realize he/she was anywhere near a window. EDIT: Thanks for all the recommendations & explanations, everyone! I've got a big list of things to watch now! Here's hoping some new directors will hear our pleas in the future!
What's your best "Idiot neighbor story"?	My neighbor moved in a few months ago and has been trouble ever since. He's a misogynistic racist bigot and the worst thing is - he won't shit the f**k up! I hear them arguing all the time but he acts like everything is fine. The only good thing is that he has a super hot (adult) daughter. She's married but comes around to the house sometimes. His wife ain't half bad either. Anyway, he's really having an effect on the neighborhood. I mean, the neighbors on the other side absolutely despise him. He says he want replace their fence with a wall... and make them pay for it. Sincerely, Canada.	My dad had a neighbor when he was young that played his radio loudly all day, even when he wasn't home or was gone on vacation. Every time he left the house and his radio was still on, my dad would go and trip the circuit breaker to his condo. One day he sees my dad, who was an electrical engineer, and asked him why his breaker kept tripping - was it faulty wiring? No, my dad explained, the loud radio was probably just putting too much strain on the circuit when left on all the time. My dad suggested he should try turning it down or off when he wasn't home, and see if that fixed it. So the man tried it, and surprise surprise, the circuit breaker stopped tripping! He was very thankful to my dad for helping him with that annoying electrical issue.
What's the most pathetic thing you've ever done to look busy and waste time at work?	If you're being judged on looking busy instead of the quality of your projects and efficiency of getting your tasks done then things are totally fucked.	I used to put documents on my desk in front of me, then lean over the top of them, holding my head up with my hands on my brow. Essentially looking like I was hunched over said document deeply interested and reading what new litigation was going around. I was actually sleeping with my head propped up.
Do you ever wonder if everything around you is actually real and you're not actually lying in a coma somewhere?	It has crossed my mind once or twice but then I realize hell is not sicker than reality and I am once more.	The whole concept of a dream is further food for thought. The fact that you can be in a dream, not knowing that your dreaming is mind boggling. If you can do that then why couldn't we be in a kind of " macro dream " in which we will wake up when we die and then realise that we were only dreaming.
What's a an actor/actress that played a role that totally threw of your view of them?	Just wanted to say, really loving this thread but why are people downvoting? Surely, when someone is thrown by a performance is a very personal thing? Jim Carrey is a case in point, that man has flip-flopped from serious to comedy his entire career but unless you've followed that closely how can you know? Only know John Lithgow from 3rd Rock then see him in Dexter, fair enough but the man has worked for decades so might not have caught his psycho performance in Raising Cain. I personally have upvoted those I agree with or added my own take on another's idea (maybe I could've been subtler) or tried to get to the bottom of someone's choice. It's not really a downvoting matter is it? inb4 downvoted to hell :)	Not a movie but I was open-mouth shocked the first time I watched Bob Sagat do standup. Can't look at Danny Tanner the same way ever again.
Who was your favorite teacher? Why?	My second grade maths teacher maybe my 8th grade bio teacher cause she had an ass of a Brazilian woman.	My mom homeschooled me for 8 years. She passed away to cancer almost 2 years ago. I am now in grad school for Physics and everything I learn I attribute to her for instilling a desire to obtain more knowledge.
Those who don't use your college degree, what did you major in?	No degree, only high school diploma. Network Engineer. EDIT: Getting downvoted for answering honestly? Welcome to the internet I guess.	Up until I was in college, I always thought that my mom majored in chemistry because she's an analytical chemist at a pharmaceutical company. Then I was struggling with a physics class, and she casually mentions, "Yeah, physics can be tough to get at first. But it's pretty fun once you get the hang of it! That's why I majored in it after all." My whole life was a lie.
How do I ask my friend if he (she?) is a boy or girl without offending him/her?	Generally in men, the ring finger is closer in length to the middle finger than it is in women. Unless they are gay. Adams apple should be fairly obvious. Do they wear a bra? Does their underwear ever peak out? How about facial stubble?	Maybe ask the teacher/professor? Just be like, "I'm not trying to be rude or nosy, but because we're studying together, I kinda need to know if I should say 'he' or 'she' when referring to them within earshot of them"... Or "compare" ID's/Driver's licences.
[NSFW] Men of Reddit, you can now sell an inch of your penis for $1,000,000. How much do you sell?	All the married ladies are probably thinking sell the whole damn thing so they can get divorced and keep half the money.	I'll keep my inches and then wait for all the other men in the thread to sell their penis' inches for cash, thus making me larger than the average population and get into porn. Make my money that way and keep my inches. All 3 of them
What seems like a rip-off, but is actually worth every penny?	Apple products. I hear a lot of people talk about the higher rated speeds and lower price tags for windows laptops, or android phones, but I'll take Apple every day. Way more reliable. Better support. Better quality products.	Dental work. The only thing worse than being ripped off dry for a tooth replacement is feeling the unbelievable pain of a rotting tooth :/
Redditors who have tried to hide on your cruise when it ended so that you could stay on the ship for the next round, how did that go?	Wish I could help but I would rather slam my balls in the door of a low rider and drive down a street full of broken glass and raw sewage than get on one of those things.	There was an episode of This American Life (I think) where a woman did this, but back in the day, like the 60s or early 70s? There were seating charts or something in the dining room so she couldn't sneak in to eat, and things that she assumed would be open most of night, like bars, weren't. She lived on a lot of bar garnishes and had to pretend she was drunk who kept passing out in the lounge. It was a lot less fun than she thought it would be, with very little sleep and cleaning herself up in public bathrooms while worrying she would be caught doing so at any time. She had to sneak back into her own country because she hadn't brought a passport.
What random fact should everyone know?	Your chances of getting shot by a cop during a traffic stop goes down dramatically if you shut up, take your ticket, and tell the officer to have a nice day because no one ever got out of a ticket by talking back to a cop.	Giant squid eyeballs and volleyballs are the same size. In case you're ever in an awkward situation at a party
What’s the most misunderstood concept about your mental disorder?	That all schizophrenics are batshit crazy. I am fine most of the time I just ocassionally see stuff. I space out too, but don't we all?	Bipolar does not mean changing from one emotion to the next within minutes. They last weeks at a time and there are, indeed, neutral states.
If you had to stand and speak in front of a class for 8 hours, what is a word or phrase they would realize you say often?	I once counted how many times a girl said like during a presentation in college and she said it something like 1-2 times a minute for 15 minutes. I wanted to die. Personally, I would say "The reality is" way too much when trying to convey that something is not as it appears etc. I overuse that phrase and must stop using it.	Apparently I say "Actually" a lot. I also use a ton of modifiers. I switch them up a lot but I tend to say lots of things like "sort of", "almost", "kind of", "a little bit". I soften all my statements with modifiers. I realized this while watching taped counseling sessions for class. Apparently it makes me look unsure of what I'm doing.
Bosses of Reddit. Have you ever experienced an employee not showing up randomly for days on end and only to discover they died unexpectedly? How did you find out?	Not died, but I had a guy not show up on a Monday morning, and about 10am, his wife called to say he was in the pokey for DUI. We gave him another shot, but he, ah, didn't work out.	My dad worked with this guy. He was never late, never called in and he didn't show up to work. No call no show in the casino means they fire you. His family all lived out of state so three days later his landlord checked on him because he was late with the rent and he never was late with his rent. He was dead. His family tried to get his life insurance but it was cancelled due to him being fired. The casino tried to say he had to call in if he missed work, no exceptions. I guess being dead is merely a slight inconvenience and you still need to call in to work.
What is the funniest G rated joke you know?	Why did the monkey fall out of the tree? It was dead. Why did the second monkey fall out of the tree? It was stapled to the dead monkey.	Two fish are in a tank. One turns to the other and asks, "Do you know how to drive this thing?"
What was the biggest "OH SHIT!" moment of your life?	I was on a high ropes course at a team building weekend for work. I was 30 feet up in the air on a telephone pole wearing a harness - they wanted me to jump over to this suspended trapeze bar. As soon as I jumped I was like "wait, is this harness held together with duct tape?" Missed the bar, fell like 10 feet and heard the harness snap... "oh shit!" I fell another 20 feet and woke up in the hospital 9 hours later	I was working for a trucking company. And the boss gave me $5k in cash to deposit. Went to the store. Left the envelope there on the counter...Went back a few minutes later...crying. Dude gave it back...phew!
What skills should a teen learn if he wants to get out of poverty ASAP?	Luck. There is no skill that can reliably get one out of poverty. The world doesn’t work that way. If you really want me to say something: effective communication. It’s free, it takes less time than ineffective communication, and it lets you market yourself when luck gives you the opportunity to do so.	He needs to learn that it will take a lot of time, and effort. Needs to learn how to save, how to live cheap. The idea that money is easy to come by if you work hard enough is a bit of a lie. you need to work hard AND be smart with your money. and even then, if you have debts its going to be a long road
If you found a device that would let you watch and listen to events in the past, no restrictions, what would you look at at? Why?	It would LITERALLY kill most jobs in the legal system. most types of lawyers would be gone from the criminal system. religion would be dead. only religious extremists would still exist, and only for a short amount of time because the military would track their movements and SQUASH them. plenty of other fields would change fundamentally. fact checking would be a snap. most investigation based services would be a minimum wage job due to a plethora of people able to use the equipment. oh, you meant just me. fuck yes i would. i would start with murder investigations, criminal cases, manhunts... i would also leak info regarding politicians to the press, with absolutely no way for them to know how that information was obtained. trump sucking putins peirogi? make that shit go public.	I'd watch when Marc Anthony got Cleopatra pregnant, for science of course. Then I'd probably watch the parents of most notable historical figures bang and see if there was any correlation between how they banged and how great of a historical figure was born, all for science of course.
To Reddit's armchair historians: what rubbish theories irritate you to no end?	Bush made up the fact that Saddam had WMDs. No he fucking didnt. There was evidence that Saddam himself wanted to give the impression that he possessed WMDs. More nations than just America were fooled. Yes the iraq war was managed horribly, but I think it was necessary.	Aside from all those conspiracy theories out there, the thing that angers me the most are the rewrites of history that try to rewrite events in black and white. Every conflict has to have had a side with good guys and one with bad guys. Every great man was either a complete monster or a saint. Reasonable and well intentioned people from centuries ago are depicted as if they would still be considered reasonable and good by today's standards. Too much of popular history as been dumbed down to the point where we have only heroes and villains, when for the most part we had mostly humans with all the flawed nastiness and aspiring greatness that this implies. I am not just upset about that because it is wrong and stupid, but because it prevents us from learning from history and repeating mistakes.
I've just received the news that a family member has died. I rang my boss to inform her there would be a funeral and that I would need to take it as a holiday. She then asked me to come into work after the funeral. What is the most ridiculous thing your boss has asked of you?	My boss text me to come to work 2 hours before kickoff of the LSU - Alabama game. I was knee deep in sorostitutes and pretty solidly drunk; and surrounded by 250,000 tailgaters. I could do nothing but laugh maniacally at her and then tell her that with my current situation and the resulting hangover there was not a chance in hell I would see her till Monday.	I had a manager ask me if she could borrow money from me. I worked part time only, my hourly pay rate was nearly half of hers, and she ordered out for lunch every day. I did not feel bad about saying no, but I did find it pretty ridiculous that she asked. edit: I should clarify that she was asking for $200 for bills, not $1 for a vending machine or something.
Reddit, what is your worst roommate story?	Why are most of the posters in this thread pussy little bitches who are afraid to stand up for themselves? Confront, call the cops, video tape, photograph, do whatever you have to do so you don't just sit there and take it like a little bitch. My god.	I had a roommate that would jerk off while wearing a condom. He then would tie the end closed and throw them in random places in his room. When he moved out I found them on top of shelves, in the closet, and in the hole on the wall where the door knob busted through it.
What TV character/personality do you hate?	Margaery Tyrell. I hope Cersei destroys that fake little bitch. It amazes me though how people take her seriously as a good person who cares about anything beyond being a queen.	The plucky hero who is "down and out" even though they are attractive, live in a nice house, have nice clothes, and everything goes right. Blegh. Such a boring story device.
Waiters/waitresses of Reddit what is the worst date you had to wait on?	A couple came into the chain restaurant I worked at. Both looked like they were mid 30s. I go to take the order and the guys says "hold on, let me call my mom. She can tell me what I would like better". The lady just looked at him like "I messed up..I messed up real bad".	I work at the quick service side of a restaurant. A woman came in with her teenage daughter and ordered a beer. Her daughter was upset, asking her to please not drink. At first I thought she didn't want to have to be the one to drive home. But the mom was determined to drink that beer because she explained, "My soon-to-be ex-husband is standing right outside. And he doesn't know it yet." I felt so bad for the daughter but it was just an awkward situation.
I've been told that when you meet the right person, you know immediately. How come when you meet the wrong person, it takes a year and a half?	Ive recently met the right person but am currently with who I thought was the right person. Working on sorting that out ASAP...wish me luck reddit	Because knowing something immediately is usually bullshit. And when you meet the wrong one, you delude yourself into believing they're great because you want them to be great.
Reddit, what was your scariest moment as a child at school?	Getting chased/kissed by boys. It was seriously the most frightening thing. It was like running from T-Rex. I got really, really good at kicking them in the balls though.	When I was VERY young, I told my teacher I had swallowed a nail and it hurt and asked if it was bad for me. I ended up getting an ambulance called and they told me I needed to be rushed to hospital as it could tear my stomach and potentially kill me. I was so terrified I thought I was going to die I couldn't stop crying and then went into mild shock. After they called the ambulance, I had to describe the nail and I perfectly described my big toenail (I used to take my socks off in the toilet and chew my toenails) I was a stupid child. I had no idea that carpentry nails were also called nails.
Reddit, is this normal?	Like that episode in HIMYM where Barney had conditioned Marshall throughout the years to relate sneezing to this sushi restaurant. Whenever Marshall would mention it Barney would sneeze so, after a while, by Barney sneezing Marshall would want to go to the restaurant. It was all a plot to see Lily's boobs.	Its pavlovian, I used to date a girl who would always put on the travel channel when we had sex, and I can't see Anthony Bordane(sp?) without getting way more excited than any man should make me.
What trend did you follow as a kid that makes you cringe now?	Voting democrat. I use to be a huge fan of Bill Clinton. Now I realize he is a rapist and a racist.	I used Bath & Body Works roll on glitter religiously (Cucumber Melon obviously). But I used so much of it that instead of having a little sparkle under my eyes, my skin was tinted green and caked with glitter.
Why are you happy to be single?	My school has 150 people in it. So let me break it down for you.. 150 students. ~75 women. Split up into 5 grades ~15 girls per grade. Let's say that I can only date one above and one below, that leaves 45 girls. I'll tell you right now, it's more like 30. -12 in a relationship. 18 girls. -6 miserable druggies. 12 girls. -7 sluts. 5 girls. -2 idiots. 3 girls. -1 pregnancy. 2 girls. -1 sister. =1 Girl. And she hasn't noticed me yet.	I am me, in all my weird glory. My time, money, mess, all belong to me. My success and my failures, all me. I know what makes me happy and I am responsible for that. Being single allowed me to figure out who I am and what I need to be a sane, healthy adult. Do I want a partner? Yes. But I've spent enough time single to know that I want someone who makes me better than I am now by filling in the gaps where I'm weak. I don't think if I wasn't so comfortable in my own skin and alone-ness, that I could so confidently say that and know what to look for.
Reddit, what is something my body can do that I didn't know about?	If you're a female then if you legitimately get raped, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. ^^^.s	Your mammalian diving reflex. If cold water (less than 70 degrees) makes contact with your face your respiration efficiency increases and you can hold your breath longer.
Single people of Reddit: What are some fun things to do by yourself to keep from boredom?	Until I am self sufficient and not living under my parents roof while in school I will refrain from dating. I just build platonic relationships is all.	Any damn thing I want. I think that relationships are beautiful and special when they're right, however when somebody else depends on you like they do when you're dating, that limits your freedom to a certain degree, with exceptions of course. I could read a book right now, or I could get piss-drunk and spend all weekend yelling at my tv. It doesn't matter because I won't be letting anybody down with my actions. The world is my oyster.
What is the most unethical thing you did in a videogame?	I sliced women in half with my claws in Prototype and when I heard their screams I got an erection. Sorry... Im glad nobody will see and upvote this.	In a game that I had when I was a kid there was a weird mole that could talk and he said something like "don't hit me please". When I tried to hit him he left an item that healed a lot of HP and he left afterwards. If you re-enter the room you find him again so I kept hitting him and re-entering the room because I wanted to fill my inventory with that item. The problem is that after hitting him too much he left saying that he will never come back because I was hurting him. When I tried to come back I found a girl who was sad because she wouldn't see him ever again and because they were friends. I felt bad
[Stories] What's your "something doesn't feel right" moment that turned out to be true?	I'm a woman and a photographer. A male acquaintance asked me to take some nude pictures of him. I was fine with this, I hadn't taken nude pictures of a man before and it could have been cool. Then he elaborated that they would be fetish and crossdressing pictures. Also cool, but I started to be a bit weirded out. Eventually I decided not to do this. Years later, I mentioned this to my girlfriend and a soon as I said his name she said "Oh god, stay away from him. He's made a lot of people really uncomfortable." So yeah. Glad I didn't do that.	When I was a teenager, I pulled up to a gas station and saw a 15-16 year old blonde girl get into a gold colored Oldsmobile with two middle age Hispanic men. She got in willingly but the scene made me really uncomfortable so I memorized the license plate. Later that day, I went back to the same place and saw a brand new "missing" persons poster with her picture. I called the police with the info I had. The car was pulled over two states away and she was reunited with her parents less than 24 hours after the ordeal began. I still remember that license plate after over 20 years.
My friend waited too long to call 911. His pregnant fiance got murdered. What is YOUR biggest regret?	Sad. Is there any reason to believe that it would have made a difference if he would have called earlier? (I write this question for the 1% probability that you are indeed his friend.)	Just about five years ago. My mom was in the hospital with an infection in an artificial joint. Nothing life threatening, but the infection and associated drugs were making her hallucinate a bit. I went to visit her, she had been there for 3-4 days. When I got there she kept on complaining that a pillow was behind her back, behind her chest and could I rearrange it. There was no pillow so I just tried to comfort her and wrote it off as another hallucination. I left a bit sad that I couldn't help her, but didn't feel like I could do anything. She suffered a heart attack that evening and died. I regret daily that I didn't tell a nurse or doctor to check on her mysterious pillow cramp. She was the best person I have ever known.
What "phase" did you go through that you're embarrassed about now?	Started my emo phase when I was around 13, 21 now and I'm still waiting to "grow out of it"	When I was younger I would ride my bike with a snorkeling mask because it was the closest thing I had to a motorcycle helmet and I wanted to look cool
Redditors who have dated famous people before they were famous, what were they like?	Well it’s all about interests. Subscribe to emails to find out events, look on fb for events happening nearby and go to them, be outgoing when you’re there and go up to people, etc. you may have to travel an hour or so, but you’ll meet a lot of cool people, even friends!	I casually dated a professional athlete when we were both in college, before he got drafted. Contrary to the stereotype of most successful/popular college athletes, he was a total sweetheart and a really genuinely good guy. He still is like that today, even though he’s now rich and famous. We still keep in touch, and he’s still got a great head on his shoulders.
Customers of restaurants that's appeared on Gordon Ramsey's kitchen nightmares, what was the food actually like before and after the show helped the resturant?	There have been allegations about fraud and shit getting made up regarding the cleanliness of the kitchens in the past. Frankly, that doesn't surprise me. It's not out of the realm of possibility that *some* owners at *some* restaurants would have messy kitchens. But the fact that Gordon seemingly finds disgusting rotten/moldy/expired food in the overwhelming majority of kitchens he visits defies belief (IMO). I know these kitchens are in restaurants that aren't doing well, but still. Plus, I have to question Gordon's ability to put aside his world-famous palate and think like a regular layperson. If the food is *that* bad (he hates almost all the food he eats), I can't imagine the places he visits would even be open anymore. It's always seemed more likely that his reactions are exaggerated to justify his being there in the first place.	It was a pizza place very local to where I live. Tiny, totally meh food. Ramsey did his thing, and a few weeks later I went there. Totally. Meh. Food. Also, slow service, long wait. The vibe was different - there was clearly an attempt to be more engaging with customers, but the actual people involved just weren't up to that.
What under $10 item is a total game changer?	A well-hidden notebook with all your passwords, codes, and information on accounts you have - all centralized in one organized place.	Those plastic drain snakes for hair. Looks like a zip tie with a bunch of cuts in the sides to make it jagged. For anyone with bathroom sink/shower/tub drains that are clogged, this thing is awesome. 10/10 would recommend before buying harsh drain cleaners.
What X-Rated history facts don't they teach you in school?	This is probably too easy but US schools still teach that Columbus "discovered America" and made friends who the the Natives. Instead of the truth that he didn't discover shit, as I always told my kids: How can you discover a place that already has people? Also he was a raping, murderous POS. Yet we still celebrate him annually..	X-rated for violence rather than sexuality, but if you want the most absolutely reviling accounts of human brutality imagineable, read *A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies* by Bartolome De Las Casas. One of the most memorable stories to me was > ... a Spaniard who was out hunting deer or rabbits realized that his dogs were hungry and, not finding anything they could hunt, took a little boy from his mother, cut his arms and legs into chunks with his knife and distributed them among his dogs. Once they had eaten up these steaks, he threw the rest of the carcass on the ground for them to fight over. It wasn't just disease that wiped out Native Americans so quickly in South America, the Spaniards were responsible for the genocide of hundreds of thousands.
What has been the worst attempt by your office/boss to improve "office morale"?	Had my boss treat our department to see Batman Vs Superman because a coworker had been an extra in it. Idk if you’ve seen the movie but... yeah.	I'm not sure what the worst was, but the best happened a couple weeks back. Our boss told us on Wednesday that Friday would be his last day. Morale shot up instantly.
What's the meanest thing anyone's ever done to you or someone you know?	I am pretty sure a couple I met at the dog park is raising my kid. That's probably the worst thing you could do to a man period.	This is pretty mild and not the worst thing somebody's ever done to me but for some reason I think about it occasionally. My first name is very common and there are always multiples of it stored in people's phones. I picked up a close (at the time) friend's phone and the contact list just happened to be open. I was listed as "bernath (ugly)".
What's a foreign idiom that doesn't translate well into English?	All of them. That's kind of the point of an idiom, is that it doesn't make any sense in any language.	if a situation has gotten out of control, in Finnish you say it's "left the mitten". that doesn't sound half as good in English.
Why are you not friends with your former best friend?	My close friend in law school was in favor of the Confederate statues remaining and slowly revealed himself to be racist in his reasoning -- he literally *did not care* about the opinions of people of color on the matter, because "tradition" and "respect" and blah blah blah. Tradition and respect don't outweigh valid considerations about racism. What sort of "tradition" stems from 100 years after the (American) Civil War? And "respect" is one hell of a dog whistle in this context. Unfriended. Haven't spoken to him since. He wasn't like this before a year ago (we graduated in 2008), or he hid it very, very well.	It was pretty clear that she only moved in with me so I'd be the rent subsidy to her and her boyfriend (who was not on the lease, but moved in first week). I let that go on for six months before demanding to only pay a third. I was still naive about her and didn't realise I wasn't really her best friend until we stopped living together. And she didn't contact me for six months unless it was about me babysitting her cat for free.
Reddit, what is the most intelligent thing your pet had ever done?	Jump off a cliff. I just closed my eyes and nodded in agreement. "No wonder you ~~are~~ were my pet."	My cat yawned, so I stuck a finger in his mouth. He sort of stared at my curiously as he shut his mouth, but didn't bite down hard. A few minutes later, he's sitting on my chest and I yawn. He proceeds to put his whole paw in my mouth.
People who dislike sports: why?	QUALIFIER; I no longer enjoy watching professional sports. Why? I did a degree in Human Kinetics and did courses in Philosophy of Sport, Sociology of Sport and Psychology of Sport all three together juat make professional sports atrocious really, bringing out the worst in humanity. Basically we've prettied up Roman Gladiators and call ourselves sophisticated. ALSO many professional sports have underlying sexism and racism and discriminate against at least one socioeconomic class. Its just annoying. We pour tons of money down the drains on HUGE arenas and economists agree they bring actually little economic return to their host cities. I could keep going but I stop here.	I never had fun doing sports myself, so I never got the hang on watching them on tv. For me it´s just a bunch of people chasing a ball up an down a meadow, or throwing a ball up and down a meadow or whatever they do with their balls.
What is a movie that has aged really poorly?	Indiana Jones was amazing when I watched it as a kid. We just watched it with our kids a few weeks ago and the action is laughable. Punches a foot from someone's face... clear timing fight choreography, etc. Like... that one guy standing on the side, tapping his feet while he counts to 5 before he jumps in and swings the sword 2 feet above his head, for the easy duck that he didn't even need to duck to avoid. So crazy. Grade school play level of bad.	Blank Check 30 year old police-woman flirts with and kisses a 12 year old boy then tells him she'll date him in 6 years. Eww
Besides sex, how can you make a shower more exciting?	Shit in it and try to dodge the chunks of poo and mini shit rivers. It can be a lot more challenging than it sounds. Especially if you have good water pressure and poop like a man.	What I like to do is cup the water with my hands against my stomach to make a small pool. I then let it fall to see how loud the water-smack could get.
Reddit, what's one little fact that you would like to know but can't?	I would really like to know if I ever go to work as an expat to America, I would end up living along bald eagles, flags, fat people on walmart, people getting their noses into your life wherever you go, etc.	I'd like to know where there is intelligent life, when and how it will contact us, and how will we (and they) react to it. Or just what aliens from other planets look like.
What one realization changed your life?	All the muscle, money, and good looks amount to nothing, what girls really want is to be dicked down on a regular basis	"I need to take control of my life, because no-one is going to force me to make something out of it."
What is the most brutal, emotionally destructive insult you know?	Besides the N word which is obvious, I once had someone call my husband a murderer for being a military serviceman. That really hit home, maybe because like many other military personnel he has had to take lives and it pissed me off. So much so that I retaliated against her.	My older brother and I were adopted. Our parents got divorced, and our dad remarried. He and our stepmom had two biological kids. Our youngest sister once said to me, “Dad doesn’t need you anymore now that he has his real kids.”
People of Reddit who have encountered a micro penis, what was your reaction?	I told him it was not going to happen, and that I just couldn't fake it. His pants were around his angels and he was fully erect.....though it was tough to tell.	The first penis I ever saw was a micro penis, so naturally I thought every penis looked like that. The next boy I hooked up with was hung like a horse and I freaked out and told him he needed to go see a doctor because "that's not normal"
What is the most dangerous encounter you've had with an animal?	Do certain humans count? I swear that we need to better classify our own species. Some people are *not* people	Was hiking and climbing up a bunch of rocks that form almost like a small cliffside so you couldn't really see where your hands were being placed. Went to grab the next rock to pull myself up and grabbed something that felt like leather and literally fucking pulled a copperhead snake down onto my head. As a man I did not even know my voice was capable of hitting such a high pitch. The snake didn't know wtf happened either so he just fucking went crazy and flew off after he hit the ground.
Have you ever been banned somewhere? If so, why?	I was in an argument on Facebook, and this woman threatened to ban me from the local bowling alley at one point because she was so enraged over my opinion. I went there that Wednesday, and nope, wasn't banned. People be crazy, yo.	I got banned from the time square Olive Garden because I kept making fun of the fact that it was the time square Olive Garden. They got very offended and said I wasn’t welcome back. To be honest, I’m somewhat proud of it.
Sometimes when i yawn, a jet of water sprays out my mouth like a cobra, why?	Yeah, I've seen it too! I think it's just different soft parts of your mouth coming together when you speak or yawn or whatever, and the saliva that gets in the way get 'squirted' away, sometimes out of your mouth. Looks freaky. :D	Dentist here.... It is just a squirt of saliva from your submandibular saliva gland . It comes out of a little oriface called Wharton's duct. It is very common to be able to make it squirt.
Have you ever been involved in a conversation with someone who is so smart it intimidates you to the point you feel like you’re not worthy of being involved? If so, how do you handle it?	A girl I was seeing was like this , she had much more knowledge of almost everything so I was constantly being corrected. I learned lots from her but we only lasted a week I couldn't date someone that much smarter than me.	There’s kind of a spectrum. I’ve met people who are super smart about one thing, and people who were generally intelligent in a Frasier Crane kind of way. I find the specific knowledge folks to be great resources for whatever their interest is, but usually a little preclusive or territorial about it almost. Generally smart people seem to be much more pleasant in conversation, albeit a little intimidating at first. I make it a point to grab coffee or lunch with these kinds of people. They often come across as lonely when you really dig in.
Reddit, in what ways was 2016 a good year for you ?	The evil witch of the west lost the election, thus WW3 avoided. And the salty tears of the crying libtards is nice too.	Stayed sober, quit smoking cigarettes, kept a job the whole year, stayed with my same gf, learned lots of stuff, finished my court problems. Basically put my life back together. Edit: fixed the extra word. Stayed is sober is not a thing Second edit: who would have thought that something positive would be my most upvoted comment. Ty people of reddit!
Why do American universities put two people in a room?	College is big business in the U.S. More people to a room = more people they can jam into a smaller space and as a result, more money to fill the university's pockets. Also, many colleges in the U.S. require you to get a meal plan if you stay on campus. Even more money down the drain. WELCOME TO AMURRIKA!	Saves money and space. Putting two people in one room, in some cases 3-4 people in a room saves a lot more time and space than one per room. Plus the gay sex.
What is a mystery that has bothered you for a long time?	So ur with ur honey and yur making out wen the phone rigns. U anser it n the vioce is "wut r u doing wit my daughter?" U tell ur girl n she say "my dad is ded". THEN WHO WAS PHONE?	The truth about the JFK assassination. I don't care about the 2nd shooter or magic bullet. I care about Oswald denying allegations, saying he was a patsy, getting himself, assassinated within 2 days of capture, thus never allowing him to tell his story. The guy who assassinated him, was Ruby, a low level thug with ties to organized crime. Ruby initially plead guilty, then asked for a retrial, as if he was going to tell the truth this time, then he Happens to die in prison from pulmonary issues. ---super sketchy.
What’s the story behind your username?	Well when I was around 9, all I did was play Xbox 360. Me and my friends all had names like XxSh4d0wW0lfxX, or XxSh4d0wW4lkerxX. And mine was XxSh4d0wCh1efxX. Over the years I’ve tried to make it less edgy but I honestly just might change it all together.	When I was 5 years old I played the Lego Star Wars Games. It was the first time I ever came in touch with the Star Wars Franchise. I didn't know the names of the characters and reading wasn't my speciality either, so I don't know why and I also don't know why I remember that, but I referred to Darth Vader as CaptainKlott. Again don't ask me why. I don't know. Two Years ago I livestreamed with a few friends and told that story to them (we played Star Wars Battlefront 2015). They and I found it so funny that I actually changed my Username in all of my games (if possible) from FireRise to CaptainKlott. &#x200B; Fun fact: I called Chewbacca Chocolate Man which I think is quite understandable.
What do people incorrectly assume/stereotype about you when they first see or meet you?	Somehow people always have weird associations because I always dress black and ask if I used to be into goth and stuff. And they often think I'm into fashion, although I'm not. I never go shopping and happen to be dresses very elegant without much effort. And they underestimate my interests,knowledge and intellect. I often hear things like "not just a pretty face", which leads me to think that they assumed that I'm simple and that they got proven wrong.	I have "male resting bitch face" and I'm a pretty quiet, kind of shy guy. Because of this and my sharp features, according to my gf, I am intimidating, look stern, and come off as an asshole. If you knew me, you would know that I am none of those things.
Nurses, Doctors or First responders, what’s the most horrific 4th of July incident you dealt with?	Took care of a dude who got plastered and blew one of his testicles off with a Roman candle. Nice guy. Bit strange, though.	I had a nine year old lose an eye a few years ago. An older kid shot a bottle rocket at him and the bottle rocket hit him in the right eye. The globe ruptured from the explosion. I had to pack his eye socket with gauze in attempt to kept the rest of the globe together but it was pretty obvious the eye was a total loss. The older kid was prosecuted for the incident.
What's a harsh truth you have for the opposite sex?	**we don't want to know about your period** Sorry if you have cramps take midol or say you don't feel well. This whole "omg I'm on my period" is out of hand. To guys this is bathroom stuff. Keep it there. Same to guys about your poop. Congrats it's well established everyone poops. Edit: not relationships. Although it shouldn't be a big production. My ex used it for an excuse to be mean. No she didn't apologize and constantly used it against me. "You're only mad because you don't get it"....	Just cause you make him hard doesn't mean you're all that special. A guy can get hard from, as I've heard someone on this site say, "a stiff breeze and eye contact."
What is your best, "Holy crap that actually worked." moment?	Sick of being nice guy for 20 years, treat a gorgeous girl like shit in public for being a total bitch, gives me her apartment key and invites me to have my way with her anytime. Never did, preferred being the nice guy.	About 15 years ago a buddy and I had to be rescued from a mountain, but the search and rescue team were having trouble locating us. They wouldn't attempt the rescue until they saw us due to the weather conditions and avalanche risk. I had the random idea to take pictures of the snow at our feet with the disposable camera I had on me. That did the trick. Apparently the flash reflecting off the snow could be seen all the way at the base of the mountain. That thought may have saved my life that night.
Your gravestone is now inscribed with the words of the last text you sent, what does it say?	I'm done with my job. Fuck that's sad. What makes it more sad. I wrote this to my crush. Who told me that we can't be a couple yet. She likes me. But she isn't ready. Or that's just me.	"Pffft. I'll be fine. Doctors can't be right about everything." Regarding me forgetting i was explicitly instructed not to drink caffeine while on a new medication. Then drinking 3 red bulls.
Teachers of small children, what are some hilarious things your kids have unwittingly revealed about their parents or home life?	Not a teacher, but my 10 year old son, while pouring the family milk for dinner, said something he definitely won't be saying in 8 years: "I hate full jugs!"	I had a kid ask me if it was normal for adults to wrestle every night before going to bed.
Who are the "McDonalds" of each musical genre?	Eminem. He used to be the best(like McDonalds) but his later albums are of much lower quality compared to his three classics. However i will say, Recovery and MMLP2 are good albums, they just arent classic status or even near it. Although before i get accused of Eminem hating, he is Top 10 unarguably, top 5 arguably, and therefore best rapper arguably. And Lose Yourself is the best hip hop song ever made.	Top 40 pop band: Maroon 5. Not the best, but the songs are easy on the ears, and the lead singer is easy on the eyes. Not a Big Mac, but definitely a McDouble.
Redditors who were once rich, how did you lose it all?	I was supposed to get a nice chunk of change back from my taxes but the federal government decided that it would be better spent on my student loans.	The problem in most cases, and I bet many on here, is lifestyle. You make $50k, you learn to live making $50k. You make $100k, your lifestyle changes, you make $500k a year, your lifestyle changes a lot. When you eventually stop making $500k a year, It's now really hard to go back to living a $100k lifestyle. My parents did just this and once had a ton of money, but they got used to the lifestyle. It took 10+ years to ween off the high end lifestyle and it cost them almost everything. Additionally, this is purely dollars and cents. It doesn't take into account the ego and perception. "You're not flying private to your vacation spot?" is a tough thing to hear from a friend when you're used to doing it. Started from the bottom, now we're here...annnnnnnnd back at the bottom.
What's your "I have no idea how I got away with that, but I won't question it," story?	In 7th grade, we had a big 100 point assignment that was due the last day before Winter Break, but it was so small and negligible only 2 people did it, and both of them happened to be absent. So that day we were all nervous because we knew the question that was gonna be asked by our teacher, but it never happened. 2016 comes around, nothing happens, so we all just look at each other (including the 2 kids who had done the project) and silently rejoiced.	Russian soldiers started executing people inside my apartment block (1994, Chechnya), so I pretended I was their supply boy for the army by quickly running up to one of the soldiers and asking if they needed more ammo. That was it, just look like you have a purpose and don't panic. They ended up sending me to actually get a box from their camp which I had no clue how to do but I managed eventually, and I ended up being a supply boy for the next month or so until they realized I was not actually with them. I didn't actually do much, I just stayed in their camp and ate their food and hid when they called names around. Maybe 50-60 people were killed in that apartment, I could have easily been one of them.
If the idiom 'they would turn in their grave' were literal, who would we generate the most power from when a dynamo was hooked up to their corpse?	The early feminists who actually fought for worthwhile causes like equal pay and voting rights. If they saw modern day feminazis and how far down they went, they could power all of NYC for a year by the multiple turns in their graves.	Why just one person? Imagine if we took all of the dead physicists of the last couple centuries, hooked them up, and told them we were going to use them as a source of infinite energy. The more energy they produce the harder they would roll.
Reddit, what's the very first thing you do when you wake up in the morning?	Turn on my laptop and check to see if my website made any sales and if my channel got any more subscribers.	I tend to step outside and I take a deep breath and get real high. And I scream at the top of my lungs "What's goin' on?"
What’s your worst birthday memory?	Abusive dads, dead hamsters, meh. Doesn’t compare to my shit Got an Xbox for my room. Wanted to copy the saves from my old Xbox to my new one. Ended up copying the fresh drive onto the old one, wiping all the data clean. Years of gaming, gone. Poof. I cried as the East-Asian waiting staff sang me happy birthday. True story. And you wanna tell me about your bad birthdays. Pathetic.	For my 16th birthday my mom gave me a brochure about wall climbing. Not a wall climbing gift card or the plans to go wall climbing, just a brochure. I don’t even like wall climbing.
What's the kindest way to break up with someone?	People hate on it a lot, but the best way I've ever been dumped was through text. I didn't have to see them, there was no awkward exit, and I didn't have to sit through their rambling speech before they got to the point. 10/10 would recommend.	Be honest, and do it face to face. Just say the real reason why you´re breaking up, and do it calmly.
What's the saddest thing you've witnessed someone do to impress someone else?	Everyone has done something like this at some point. You can say you don't give a shit what people think, but in the spur of the moment everyone can be a shit head for a second. Who hasn't said a shitty thing to a friend in front of a new hot girl to make themselves look cool?	This guy tried to show-off his "strength" by trying to pick the girl up from behind princess-carry style. She wasn't expecting it and he only picked up her legs without supporting her head causing her to hit her head hard on the tile floor. Whole room went silent. I think she got a concussion from that.
Fire up the throwaways. What's something that has happened to you that you wish you could tell your friends about but is too inappropriate?	I'm married and I fucked a hooker balls deep in the ass without a rubber. I don't regret one fucking second of it and I'm probably going to do it again. My wife is a fucking cunt.	My mom got home as I was in the middle of a furious fap session. I heard the garage door, went to quit internet explorer (this was a while ago) and the little shit just froze with boobs all over the place. I quickly tried to restart the computer, but that didn't work (WTF?). I finally ubplugged the power strip as my mom opened the door. There I am, in boxers, with the power strip in my hand and the computer is off. The first words out of my mouth were, "I don't know, weird huh?" -.-
[Serious]Redditors who have slept with their step sibling - whats your story?	Long story short, my step-sister hated my bio mom She started having sex with me when she was 17 and I was 15 When she turned 18 and moved out, she dropped the bomb that she's been fucking her son as a huge fuck you She did admit that she liked the sex	We were both 18 and horny No interesting story really, turns out that humans just have a strong instinct to just fuck each other, especially when you spend lots of time together.
My umbrella is not rust-proof. Reddit, what are some design flaws that make you facepalm?	One of the computer labs on campus has these group study rooms you can use. There's a couple couches, tables, chairs, a monitor that can be used as a second computer screen and a whiteboard. However one of the couches is in front of the whiteboard and the room is too small to move things around so the whiteboard's pretty much a huge pain to use.	The cupholder in my dad's car blocks the radio, so you can either listen to music or not spill your drink.
What is NEVER worth being angry at?	Honestly, sports fans cannot be angry at the game. You didn't contribute anything to it, you weren't on the team, you're simply there to support	Someone not reciprocating your feelings. Unless they were specifically an asshole about it and knowingly dicked you around of course. But it's stupid to be angry at someone just for not liking you back.
Reddit, have you ever confessed your love to somebody, how did it go?	I confessed my love to a married girl at work last year when I was already sure she knew how I felt. As it turned out she felt the same to me and started opening up about her relationship not being perfect and all that. Long story short she filed for divorce recently and I'm waiting in the hangar for the day the divorce is final to finally get what I want	I told her. She said "awww", laughed and patted me on the head like a fucking dog. Aint' been right since.
Reddit, what the best revenge you've ever gotten on someone?	* Be Highschool freshmen, didn't know anyone in this new school * Some kid that no one really liked but hovered around the popular kids made fun of me (I don't remember exactly what it was...) * The bell rings he starts running as hard as he can out the classroom for the cafeteria. * I stick my leg out he flies two feet and slams face first to the floor. Everyone laughed and applauded. No regrets	Fast revenge is good revenge. When we were kids my sister pushed a whole raw egg into my mouth while we were fighting. I threw up and pushed that into her mouth. Justice done.
What's something you just don't find funny?	John Oliver ~~>inb4 downvoted to oblivion~~ I personally don't find him to be a funny person in general. Some of the jokes he says are funny, but I just feel like the show would be funnier with a funnier host. It doesn't help that he repeats certain setups multiple times which weren't all that funny or clever to begin with. It's just a personal taste thing	When you watch a fail compilation video and see people making stupid decisions and failing (funny) but then the author puts random car accidents with cars running over people or things like that....... what the hell? "He wanted to cross the road but a car killed him! FAIL!! HAHA!"
You are teleported 10 years into the future for 10 minutes before you are brought back to the exact moment you left. When you get there you are in a closed room with a computer that has a web browser but nothing else. What do you search for?	I create an e-mail, contact Blizzard and tell them ideas for World of Warcraft expansions (I'd just tell them the ones that actually came out), leave a phone number and tell them to contact me in the future. Hopefully they'll pay me.	Unless I knew ahead of time that I was going to be transported 10 years into the future for 10 minutes and then come back, I'd probably spend the 10 minutes trying to figure out what the hell was going on.
What's a life-changing experience you think every young person should go through?	Pride Parade. I used to be this homophobic little fuck but one day I came across one and saw LGBTQIA+ people fighting for their rights and their lives. I couldn't help but change my views after that and about a year or two later I got my head out of my ass and realized I'm bi. I know so many people who have gone through similar things. I just think that seeing people in their real lives can change perspectives.	Having a bad or failed friendship. It sucks but I have learned so much about myself this way. I know how to spot red flags early and know the types of people to avoid. I really wish I had learned things earlier. I would have spent more time with the people that still matter to me and less time with the people who I am just an afterthought too.
Reddit, who was "that" kid in your school and what did he do?	Hit on his cousin and fucked around with my female friend i wouldve kicked his ass if the football coach wasnt watching	There was a boy named Jerry who liked Rubik's Cubes, he fucking had them everywhere, even in class. There was one where I went into the toilets and I just heard clicking of a Rubik's cube coming from the stalls, you always knew it was him.
Do you give money to homeless people? Why or why not?	I saw a homeless guy just spend his money on cigarettes and a soda. I only donate to people who play instruments or have something artistic/do something productive.	No. I donate and volunteer at a shelter every other week or so, at least when I'm in the states.
What would you do if you were invisible for a week?	Rape my neighbor, kill an old man, and then kill all of my coworkers. Edit: All but two of them. Those two escaped after I tried to blow up the office with nitroglycerin.	I would wear a sheet and try to scare people. When they are not afraid and take off the sheet, there would be nothing under it, and they would really freak out.
How often do you notice racism in your country?	If you live in America, your either a nigger, honky, chink, or a spek. Who'd think a country based on slavery and prejudice would remain racist?	almost every day - liechtenstein most of the time its phrases of which most people don't even realize they are being racist...
Non-Americans who have visited the US: What surprised you the most about the US, and what surprised you the least?	Most: that there are parts of cities where people are afraid to go out of fear of being robbed Least: everyone was fat.	Friends from Ireland were astonished by the mailbox. See, I put in a letter, and lift this little flag up, and that lets the mail carrier know that I have a letter to mail. After he picks it up, he puts the little flag down, and I know he's been there. "Feckin' brilliant, dat."
Redditors who hate your job, what's the time and call-in number for the conference call today?	Well I don't hate my job - I actually in fact love it. In 4 minutes - it's our Northeast core and small group markets sales reports. After each sales rep (aka me) gives our updated rep readout (i.e sales numbers) I believe the VP of our NYC group office will be discussing the new New York Paid Family Leave law that will go effective 1/1/2018. You are all more than welcome to join, but you have to have a company E-mail and log in through Skype business. See you all there!	This has potential for one of the most epic TIFU reddit would ever have seen. Please, someone, get in on this!
Parents of Reddit: Be honest, has there ever been a moment that you regretted having children?	Of course it is just biological. What isn't? Unless you have strong religious beliefs then you must see that everything we think, say and do is controlled by our biology. Doesn't mean that it will not give us great joy, love, delight, fulfillment, interest etc . Food, sex, scratching an itch, making friends, fighting wars, wearing clothes, loving our parents etc etc are all based on our biology . Having children gives us huge rewards because if it wasn't fantastic the human race would have stopped doing it and died out long ago. Remember most people do it more than once!!	One time when I was changing my daughters diaper she projectile shat so ferociously that it not only ended up on my arms/hands, but on our bed several feet away. I definitely questioned my choice at that point. Otherwise it's been pretty damn awesome though. You get to see a person go from knowing absolutely nothing about the world to figuring it out. Pretty surreal.
Reddit, what's the most obvious lie you've said to someone that they actually believed?	I love You. You stay with someone because you're a selfish piece of shit who doesn't want to be alone. The longer you wait to break it off the harder it gets. I'm a horrible person.	I convinced my nephew that the grooves in the asphalt on the shoulder were to allow blind people to drive. Didn't find out that he believed me until his friends from school were over and they too were convinced.
Which social interactions do you most dread?	Having to deal with someone who is socially inept. I don't understand why they have to make everything so awkward.	When I see someone from high school/university who I recognize, but isn't really my friend, walking towards me from about 50 yards away. The whole agonizing time you have to look away or down at the floor and pretend you didn't just make eye contact until you're about 5 yards away, then awkwardly look up and say hello and hope to god they don't stop and try to engage you in small talk.
What was something that shocked you when you visited a foreign country?	I was shocked by how much I detested American culture. The more I travel there, the more I hate it.	I lived in Japan for a year. The satellite radio at my school had a channel called "Rokki" that played the Rocky theme song on a loop 24:7.
Barbers of Reddit, have you ever made an enormous mistake while cutting a customer's hair?	every fucking time. i just want a trim…bzzzzzt. "how does that look? 15 quid please…" it looks like i could have done it myself at home with my own clippers, which is precisely what i am off to do.	I was in cosmetology school, barely had much hair cutting experience, and a friend of mine volunteered me to cut his brothers hair without notice at the end of the school day. The kid had a beiber cut essentially, and was too shy to tell me exactly what he wanted and since it was so close to closing time, most of the instructors had left, leaving me flying solo. It was just horrible. By the time I had gotten half way through, I could feel the seething, silent hatred of ththat poor 16 year old soul and handed my shears to the instructor. God, I was mortified for him. I just can't even explain it- he had a shag, essentially by the end of it.
What's the best prank you've ever heard of/seen/experienced?	My boyfriend's Dad (let's call him George) was at Oxford University when a Cambridge professor came to give a guest lecture at his college. For those of you who don't know, Oxford and Cambridge have this rivalry going on. At three am George and his mates went out, spray painted (quite well) the car a different colour and had it turned to face the other way. These were the days when cars couldn't be opened by clicking the keys and so only way the poor professor could eventually tel which car was his was from his number plate.	My flatmates cut out pics from porno magazines and taped them all over the passenger side of my car. The way my car was parked, I could not see any of it when I drove off to work. I was wondering why everyone was honking at me on the freeway and giving me weird looks. Finally, my manager at work calls me outside to explain why there are blowjobs on my hubcaps.
What's the most pointless argument you've been passionately involved in?	Arguing that, no, the Earth is not 6000 years old, it's 4.5 billion years old. Of course, arguing with a religious person is never going to work. They're seemingly incapable of changing their minds.	My junior year of high school I got into a very heated debate with my friend over whether Cheetos were considered chips. After half an hour of yelling about this he finally called frito-lay headquarters to ask their opinion on the matter. I was right, they're not chips :)
Wounded raccoon hiding in my daughter's wagon. Humane society won't help. What can I do for it?	put it out of its misery. its a coon, they're pests for farmers and home owners and they way to over populated.	Holy crap, it just walked past the sliding glass door on the back. It's holding one paw up like it's injured. Scared the jeepers out of me. I ran to put the dogs up and it's gone again.
In the movie Ratatouille, the chief Horst claims to have robbed the 2nd largest bank in France only using a ballpoint pen. How would you rob a bank only using a ball point pen?	Go to the bank, tell them that i want to open an account and pay in 3 million dollar. But first i want to speak to the manager I need reasons to chose this bank. Get alone with him in his office, grab him by his neck and.. gently put the pen in his asshole, chances he's gay are there. If he likes it, I'm gonna start a love story with him till i get the code to the tresor, bye.	Go to the teller and say "hey, I'll trade you a pen for a pen." After I take the pen the teller will realize that I gave them a decoy pen without an ink cartridge. Now I have scammed the bank out of an ink cartridge.
What is the most awkward crush someone has had on you?	The sister of a former friend once had a crush on me. She was fat and I think she was a nazi. Anyhow, back then I wanted to sell my phone, because I was about to get a new one. She pretended she was interested in buying it and secretly saved her number in it (plus writing down my number). After that she texted me every now and then. I was really disgusted by that fat pig, but couldn't insult her because she was my friend's sister.	My cousin once had a crush on me.. She was 2 years younger and when I was 20, she saw something on a movie where the girl waits on a bed naked and waits for the guy to come in.. So when I was coming home (I live with my grandmother) she came to my grandma and she waited on the bed in only underwear, nothing on the top.. However, my grandmother failed to mention that I was bringing my college girlfriend for the weekend.. As I was unloading my grandmother offered to show the room that my girlfriend was going to sleep in. However, they opened the door to my cousin who screamed profusely.. Awkward.. **TL;DR My cousin laid on the bed naked when I came home only to be walked in on by my college girlfriend and my grandmother**
What supposedly "sexy" celebrity just doesn't do it for you?	Emilia Clarke. Looks like a doll - huge head, huge teeth, short chubby body, kind of a pretty face in that Disney character way. I mean let's face it that show has many chicks hotter than her - Sansa, Mel, Cersei, Missandei... and that is only those who are currently alive.	There should be rule in this thread that you have to post a picture of the person you are talking about.
Are you gratuitous or frugal with your up-votes? Why?	Take your up-vote for asking sir. Edit: Pardon my presumptuousness - you may be a lady and not a sir considering the username	Anything I agree with, made me laugh, has a bunch of dislikes for no reason, made me think, or brings up an interesting topic, I upvote. If I appreciate it, I show it.
Non-religious people: why are you not religious?	I'm not religious per se, but I am a multi person solipsist, I believe everyone's reality is there own reality. If in your reality god exists, then for your reality he exists and he is real. However I believe he does not exist and in my reality he does not exist, that is MY truth and reality. Reality is subjective, you believe and it becomes your reality, however that is not the same as anyone else's reality. I respect everyone's reality as long as they respect mine, unfortunately most do not, I explain my reality and they always try to twist it to their reality, I nod and smile then refute their logic, I stay calm, they become angry. This is why my reality does not contain a rigid doctrine dictated by a religious manual several hundred years out of date.	No reason to be religious. I really wish there was a god and eternal life but wishing isn't going to get me anywhere.
If e​​v​​er​​y a​​c​​to​​r had the a​​bi​​lit​​y to r​​a​​ll​​y an army of all the f​​ict​​iona​​l c​​hara​​cter​​s t​​he​​y'v​​e p​​la​​yed​​, who w​​o​​ul​​d have the s​​tro​​nges​​t army?	I'm pretty sure the Harry Potter army of underage wizards and witches will outsmart all the adults and take down the most powerful foes.	Does voice acting count? Because if so, Mark Hamill gets not just Luke Skywalker, but Fire Lord Ozai, SEVERAL versions of the Joker, Colonel Muska, Master Eraqus, and even a video game version of Wolverine.
In what situation did you have to lower your standards?	My ideal guy would have to make more than me (and I already make in the top 15% of my generation), have a degree from a top-level school like me, and would ideally be a 6-6-6 (six feet, six pack, six figures) Jewish guy. Took a chance on a teacher. I make more than double what he does, he went to a state school, and he's a fit and attractive agnostic. I've never been so happy with anyone in my entire life. Turns out those other things really don't matter.	Whenever I've had to take a dump at a music festival - there comes a certain point where the grossness of the port-a-john beats shitting your pants.
Girls of Reddit, what sort of hints do you drop to guys to let them know that you're interested?	God, this type of question again.. I wish there was a reddit for adults or something. I'm tired of this teenage shit	My boyfriend and I, before we got together, kept magically getting to the bus stop at the same time. Our timetables coincided nicely, but I did occasionally have to miss the very first bus that turned up in order to make it happen.
What false assumptions do people make about you based on your appearance?	I'm a clean-cut, somewhat quiet guy with a small, but fit build who works in IT. People assume I'm just the typical nerdy, but amiable, married engineer with a couple of kids. Prior to college and my current career, I served six years in the Navy on a submarine. I have been halfway around the world, and been drunk and somewhat disorderly in several countries. I was an expert skier, a certified scuba diver, and an active mountain biker. But all that takes a toll on a person. I wanted to settle down with a family. So now I still have all my great memories, but now I wake up sober in my own bed.	Lots of people think I look like someone who majors in science or engineering at a prestigious university, but I'm actually a highschool dropout
If pointless displays of bravado really are an indicator of a small penis, who probably has the smallest penis ever?	The smallest penis is to none other than **KANYE**, for acting like he's the shit when we all know he's not.	Definitely not me, that's for sure. Too bad I can't answer this question in detail, I gotta catch a helicopter flight to my island of hot women.
What popular phrase infuriates you?	If you use 'literally' to do anything other than differentiate a figure of speech from metaphor, I'm probably not interested in knowing you.	"faith in humanity lost/restored." It's usually about something really stupid too. THIS 8 YEAR OLD DOESN'T KNOW WHO JIMMY PAGE IS. FAITH IN HUMANITY LOST BLAAARRRRGHHH
What line from a movie or show is indelibly imprinted on your mind?	Slightly NSFW [My friend showed me a porno he had seen on the internet, he fast fowarded to a part where the guy was doing anal on this chick and goes ass to mouth. The guy then says the best line i have ever heard in a porn. "Yeah, Eat your butt!" in the most serious of tones. I laugh every time.](/spoiler)	Mr. Madison, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
Which excuse do you hate the most?	"I don't have time" as a reason for not e.g. working out at a gym. Well, we all have 24 hours so if you can't set aside 1 hour equal to 4% of your day, then you just don't want it enough and your priorities are wrong.	Sort of unrelated, but I REALLY hate when I explain how/why something happened and they say "That's not an excuse" - Bitch, I'm not saying it validates or qualifies what happened, but it explains WHY it happened.
What design "flaw" serves an important purpose we wouldn't expect?	The electoral college in the US creates a system where the votes of lesser-populated states are worth more than those of heavily-populated states, yet without it, the United States would consistently vote for Democratic presidential candidates every year because the majority of the population lives in urban areas. Basically it prevents the US from becoming a one-party State.	The way that our larynx and esophagus are set up. We need all of that stuff in order to be able to make such a variety of sounds, which we need to have language. So, to me, it's worth choking on water every now and then.
What do people constantly underestimate?	The power of hate-speech. Yes, I agree, freedom of speech is important. But if word can make people hate a group and convince people to act on this hatred, you need to stop acting like they "are just words". Hate isn't born in a vacuum.	Water. Water only a few inches high can sweep you off your feet it's moving quick enough. Currents on the surface of a body of water don't mean anything. Swim too deep and you might never come back up.
What’s the most useless information you know?	You are holding your phone with your pinky below it and the other fingers on the back of it... all the while operating with your thumb.	In the original Dennis the Menace tv show (black and white,) there was an episode where Mr. Wilson revealed to Dennis the combination to his safe and asked him to keep it a secret. Dennis immediately started using it to call plays while playing football in the yard with the neighborhood kids. The combo was 18-24-36. I have no idea why I’ve never forgotten that.
What weird shit have you seen/heard happen in a subway?	On my way to work, walk into a car on the 1 Train (NYC) and find a (presumably) homeless woman squatting in the middle of the car, openly urinating on the bench seat. Did an about-face and took a seat in a different car.	The tube around comic con time is wild. You see see Naruto sitting on the central line at 8:00, Harry potter reading a metro on the District, Deadpool is always doing some weird shit on the tube. One year I was dark willow from Buffy (who looks like an aggressive af emo with black lipstick and black veins on my face) and I come from not a great area. It's fair to say that on that crowed af train journey during rush hour nobody sat near me thinking I was going to kill them or something. I also got some dirty af looks. Fun times
Today my mom hinted that I shouldn't go to a waterpark with my family, because she would be embarrassed of my psoriasis. Reddit, what's the most insensitive thing your parents have ever done/said to you?	Once my mom told me I should try to "suck in my gut better" so I don't look so fat... (I'm not really fat.. let's just say I like my beer and have a little bit of a ponch haha).	One of my friends held a friend of his while he died, after he had been hit by a car. My friend's mom, upon learning of this, then proceeded to say "That'll teach you kids to do your drugs and stuff. You deserve this." This accident happened at work, no drugs were involved. Our friend was in shock, and almost lost it when his mom said this. It was fucked.
What do you think will be officially banned in 10 years?	Boxing. Is it really a sport to pummel each other until someone falls down from a concussion. A sport with a well linked association to brain damage and early death. It seems to be fading, hopefully it will go away.	Tanning salons. In my country anyway (Australia). Our government has started to restrict who can use tanning beds and how often and we've had a couple of really big cases where tanning bed users have developed skin cancer from using them and have passed away. One woman before she died headed a very public campaign against using them. Edit: I've received quite a few messages informing me they have already been banned, beginning in 2015. I've also had a few angry messages about personal freedoms. I do agree. I also see it from our government's position however. Healthcare is free and this is an avoidable burden to the state (much like the effects of smoking).
What is the best thing about living in a third world country?	Reminder: Sweden is considered a third-world country and has one of the highest standards of living in the world. A third world country is one which did not align with the 1st world (the United States and its allies) or the 2nd world (the USSR and its allies) following the second world war.	You can bribe your way out of everything You can pee almost anywhere You don't need a permit to build up a shop.
Poor people of Reddit, What do rich people do not seem to understand?	Trying to heat the flat for winter and still smoke weed everyday. *what do rich people seem to not understand?	That there is no outside help if you fall down. If you live paycheck to paycheck or are poor in general, one life disaster can completely devastate your life. Many people in these situations do not have family/friend support systems they can fall back on during tough times. Either your family/friends are poor too or don't care to help. It's crazy how many people just assume there is always someone to help you out.
Chefs of reddit, what is your least favorite dish to prepare from the menu where you work?	Paninis, its a stupid sandwich that you toast. Go get subway, they have more options and they arnt wasting years of culinary practice to put some ham and cheese between bread.	When I was a cook I used to hate making quesadillas. We made them in skillets and I only had 6 burners to cook everything in my part of the kitchen with. When groups would come in and order 4 quesos and some other dishes and I would get yelled at because I took longer than the 15 minute window we were given drove me mad sometimes. Yes they are easy to make. Just they take up to much space and cause a back up of tickets when they come in bunches.
What can you not believe is socially acceptable now?	Sexually mutilating little boys penises. I'm glad it's not as common as it used to be but I want the barbaric practice to die completely.	People doing stupid stuff or being complete assholes to strangers so that they can post it on YouTube or on Vine.
What is something that your parents do that pisses you off to no end?	Practice Islam. Wake me up at 5 in fucking morning to bow to some damn sky man, donate a good chunk of income to religion, read nonsense scripture, have bigoted views, etc.	How bluntly racist they can be. They are not really exposed to other cultures much. As far as i know they don't even know they are being racist. But what pisses me off is that when i try to explain them how it's not nice to stereotype a particular group of people and call them "bad", i get told how naive i am and that i should get back to the "real world".
Young teenagers of Reddit, how do you feel about the way your parents shared photos/stories about you on social media before you had a say?	I let my mum post pictures of me as long as I'm not tagged. Plain reason is that I don't want the pricks at my school to friend my mum etc and it would just cause a shitstorm. I cba to fight that many kids. Secondary reason is the photos make me look gay. I'm not homophobic but I just don't want to look gay.	I'm nearly 18 now and have already begun the process of untagging myself from a lot of embarrassing pictures my mom has tagged me in on Facebook. I know it's dumb to care so much about pictures, but I get really embarrassed on how unphotogenic I am, and I don't want my friends seeing the many bad photos of myself my mom has up on her page that she tagged me in. The ones from when I'm very little don't bother me as much since I was a cute baby, but the ones from 13-now make me really uncomfortable and self-conscious.
What is the one movie you never want to watch again?	All of 'em? I'd rather watch a new movie than the same one twice. Never understood the whole re-watching & re-reading phenomenon.	I actually paid money to go see "Son of the Mask". I was the only person in the whole theater. It was a couple of days after it came out so I thought nothing off it. The only reason I stayed was because of the principal of paying for it. I paid money, goddamnit I was going to sit through this piece of shit. The sad thing is, half way through it, some kids snuck in, sat down for 10 minutes and walked out. Edit* Yes I know I could have gotten a refund. That wasn't the point. I think it's called sunk cost... Another Edit* Did you guys know Jamie Kennedy is going to be in the new " Tremors" movie coming out? Last edit* I was being sarcastic about the sunk cost fallacy. I never heard about it until today when I heard about 15 billion times.
Ladies of Reddit, what's something a guy you were previously uninterested in has done to change your mind?	Take all of this shit to r/askwomen. I'm tired of seeing a "I'm a total loser, what's a cheat code for sex?" thread every day. Get in shape Develop a personality Dont be a coward	Just remembered another one from my other job. There is a guy in my office who is really nice, but terribly awkward. He has a very nervous laugh that he does whenever I ask him a question. He likes me because I always share my amazing lunches with him. Then we had the Christmas party, we all got a little too drunk, then decided to go swimming. This guy didn't bring swimmers, so he just got naked. The weird thing is, when he got naked his nervous laugh disappeared. The rest of the night he was talking to me normally and we found out we have a lot in common. I'm not dating him, but I totally want to bang him.
[Serious]I'm tired of all the doom and gloom. What can you tell me about life, the universe and everything that will make me feel hopeful and happy about the future?	Once this life experience is over, your consciousness joins the universal consciousness and you can share and enjoy every experience in the universe without fear or pain..	Despite the impression you might get from the news, the long term trend across the planet as a whole since 1945 has been fewer people dying from war, less starvation, greater literacy rates and better quality of life.
If you could wear the same thing every single day, like a cartoon character, what would that be?	I have a Fluttershy shirt I adore. That would be it. Along with my black cargo pants and rainbow studded belt.	I think the best part of looking like a cartoon character is that my hair would always be some crazy thing with a distinct silhouette and I'd never have to maintain it because it'd always look awesome.
What made you cool in school that would be very uncool in adulthood?	I've hurt a lot of my classmates through bullying because they were gay, black, or fat. Yes, it made me look cool and intimidating at the time but doing that now would make me look like a selfish asshole.	In 3rd grade I broke my arm and got a glow in the dark cast, I also had glow in the dark shoes, I think it was the most my peers have ever liked me in my life.
What’s a great story you have but haven’t seen the right AskReddit post to tell it?	Hmmm, I'd have to think about it. I've told the 'masturbating an elephant' story a time or two. Never told a couple of 'close to death' stories, though.	So I was at my older cousin's house when I was and 7 or 8 had a fear of the dark at the time. We were sitting on his bed, and my cousin says that there's be a portal to a magical world under his bed and I, being the dumbass kid I was, went under the bed, expecting a portal in the wall or something. My cousin then turned of the lights, ran out of the room, and locked the door. I don't think I forgave him for that for the rest of the visit.
What is the coolest thing you've ever seen in real life?	Every day can feel like the most beautiful and amazing thing I've ever seen, when accompanied by music. There's a song for every sight, perfect enough to make your heart ache.	The Wall concert in Berlin 1990 Nothing like getting hugged by drunken East Germans all night. It was pretty cool having 400k people screaming "TEAR DOWN THE WALL" in Berlin at the end of the concert. Good times...
What internet trend annoys you the most?	"Good on you." I know Australians say it. I think maybe Brits. But it's never been an American thing. Ever. And don't give me that "OH YOU SPEAK FOR ALL AMERICANS?" crap. You know what I mean. But now, a bunch of dorks on reddit found it cool to speak like other cultures, and now everything I see something positive on the internet, all I see is "Good on him!" NO MOTHERFUCKER. Good FOR him. AMERICANS SAY "GOOD FOR HIM/HER/YOU." Stop it.	What YouTube is slowly becoming. I remember I could go to the trending page and actually click on great content. Now it's all just "Reaction" videos or teenage Vloggers using clickbait titles which just ends up being 10 minutes of them yelling into the camera.
Every single book I've ever read is just a different rearrangement of 26 characters. What are some things that, although obvious, are still somewhat amazing to you?	When I'm watching rape porn and my crush suddenly appears in my mind i just think "Hey, i could just walk up to her and rape her and be like kthnxbye"	I'm always amazed when I go up in an airplane and it's bright sunshine above the clouds. Of course it is, because the clouds are what blocks out the sun, but whenever I look up at a grey sky from the ground it still makes me happy to think that there's a sunny day above them.
What's the craziest thing you've done for a crush?	Fucked a guy in front of him...except my crush is my husband and I fucked a guy in front of him and he really enjoyed watching me. So now its a regular thing. (same guy, I don't want to risk std stuff and I know he's clean.)	My then crush accidentally threw away her retainer. I dug through the trash at our high school to find it for her. I admit it made me look desperate but she seemed to like me a little more after that. We have been married for almost 10 years now.
What is a ridiculous assumption you made as a child?	My Aunt lived with my Grandma and Grandpa she had the upstairs to her self we were not allowed up there so Grandma told us that that a horse that lived in the other bedroom and it did not like kids now and we believed her now I tell that to my nieces and nephews some stories shouldn't die	I thought that since 2% milk had 2% fat and 1% milk had 1% fat that whole milk simply had 100% fat (it didn't have a percentage next to it). I drank whole milk.
What is something you got into after the hype was allready over?	Most things. I am a contrarian by nature. I don't mean to be, I just hate fads. So if something is insanely popular, I just hate it. I talk shit on it and bash people into whatever it is. Then once the hype dies down I check it out and I'm like "Hey, this isn't that bad. I'm just an asshole."	Harry Potter All the hype made me not want to read the books or watch the films. I was sick of seeing it everywhere Then in January of this year I decided to give the books a go, I'd finished reading the series by May and currently working my way through the films
Today I had to explain to my Academic Success class the concept of "ebonics." I'm the only white person in a class of 30. Reddit, what are some of your "DON'T SHOOT THE MESSENGER" moments?	Telling my Social Justice class that Obama won because he was black and got the black vote. After much angst and borderline violence the professor stepped in and confirmed it. :/	In my mind, I see you saying that line with an ever-quieting falsetto: "most commonly used to describe a dialect popular in the^African^American^community."
What TV Series has the Best Pilot episode?	Nearly everyone in this post has absolutely no idea what a pilot episode is. A pilot episode is not the first episode, its the one created to sell the show. Often a lot is changed after a pilot episode. Perhaps OP doesn't know what one is either.	I thought Burn Notice had a great pilot - just wish they had kept the same level of humor they started with throughout the rest of the series.
History buffs, what is a commonly held misconception that drives you up the wall every time you hear it?	That Democrats were the KKK and Lincoln was a Republican. Both are true, but there is a lot of context and things have changed.	Louis-Michel le Peletier cast the single vote that sentenced Louis XVI Actually the vote was a pretty clear majority in favor of execution
What is hands down the best horror movie you have ever seen?	The Ring. The original Japanese version, not the shitty remake. The TV scene remains the creepiest thing I've ever seen in a movie. I actually moved my TV out of my bedroom afterwards. Totally freaky.	Alien (1979). This movie has scared me for so long because of how well they hide the Alien. I've never been in so much suspense [than when](#s "Dallas is in the air vents and is trying to kill the alien").
Dark mode users of reddit, whats it like? Is it nice not having headaches 24/7?	As a real fact, i code and chat only dark mode. Even on daily basis i can see white a lot.	Great actually, I specifically use dark mode to avoid headaches because I'm actually prone to chronic migraines! So thanks for noticing! 🙂
Babysitters of reddit, what's your demon child story?	This is my time to shine!! I was basically minding my own business looking for a shaded spot to chill. Without notice or discussion a child was given to me from the Gods above. It didn't go to well, I'm dead now. :(	I had one main family I regularly babysat for after college and they recommended me to a friend of theirs who had two girls. Both families were well off, but very different. Anyway, the second family's two girls were beyond spoiled. I mean, TV reality show spoiled. The youngest, who was five, would blood curdle scream for a good 15 minutes running through this mansion house when it was time for bed. I always felt like an asshole calling the mother but they didn't pay me enough to put up with that bullshit. I'd have to set the girl up in the "special room" and rub her back while she fell asleep after she spoke to her mother. I sat for them three times and avoided their calls after that.
People who keep the dealership license plate frame on, why are you giving the dealership free advertising?	Who gives a shit... no one ever bought a car because "Steven Nissan/Infinity" was on a paper plate. This is literally one of the dumbest questions i've ever heard. You poeple walk around with iphones, wearing nikes, with your fucking stupid hats with the tags on. On top of that.. you kids won't even put your cloths on unless it's a name brand. What a joke question.	Ive ordered a new vehicle and they drilled holes in the back panel and mounted a small dealer advertising medallion. Wife made them take it off and explain how could they dare to do that without our permission. Boy was she pissed.
Have you ever thought to yourself, this is it, I am going to die?	be at about a [7] omw to go fishing with neighbor he stops at mother in laws house tiny baby woman standing outside holding 200lb saint Bernard on flimsy leash pooch charges me this is how I die... mfw doggie stops and presents self for pettings Good dog. Edit because edit.	Yeah, I was skydiving and my parachute wouldn't open no matter how hard I tugged at it. Somehow I got it to open, but let me tell you it's not a good feeling...
Redditors who ran away from home as kids: what did you pack?	I never ran away, I’m scared of being alone in the outside world, besides I love my family. And u can’t take that away, and also cuz I’m a good boy	I tried once, and I did not pack anything. I was so mad about *something* that I walked right out the door and down the country road in my boxer shorts, I made it a couple hundred yards before I started to think
Youth sports referees of Reddit, what is the worst parent meltdown you've ever experienced?	I was about 14, reffing a basketball game, under 11s I think it was.... this one dude was just an asshole, ever screaming at his own son (who wasn't that good, but his dad seemed to believe he was a prodigy) while on TO... disgusting to watch. Anyways lucky for me, my dad was their watching me that weekend tournament, cause the dude rushed me when I called a foul on his son, he shoved me from behind to the ground, then gave me one kick to the stomach, my dad came out popped him with a 1,2 and dude was sleeping... lucky for guy tho I was able to calm my old man down saying the kick didnt even hurt, or he probably would have killed him	My spouse was coaching a youth soccer game (girls, U10) and the ref was about 15. He called a foul and a dad from the other team ran onto the field and began chasing the ref. Spouse, the assistant coach, and the team's parents formed a wall and yelled at the ref to get behind us. The kid was shaking, and in shock kept repeating he needed to get his corner flags. No, kid. The game is over. Go to your car, go home. We'll get your flgs for you. The daughter of the dude was just standing on the field crying.
What's your sixth sense?	I’m psychic and even work with ex CIA Stargate people. I predicted COVID, a terrorism event and even found a missing child before. So I guess you can say, telepathy, remote viewing and precognition to name a few of the Noetic Abilities I have	I have this awesome ability to leave my work desk at the right time and miss a call or two. I could be at my desk for hours and never get a call, leave for a few minutes and come back to a voicemail.
What made you NOPE the hardest in your life?	basically I asked if this chick I was seeing would have an abortion if I somehow got her pregnant, as soon as she said she wouldn't I NOPE'd it the fuck out of there..	I played Rugby for a number of years for a team, and while scrimmaging I heard a loud crack. When I located the noise, our teammate had snapped both the Tibia and Fibula bones right in half. His broken leg was flopping around like a fish out of water. That was my NOPE! moment.
Bosses of reddit, what is the stupidest thing you have had to fire someone for?	I've enjoyed reading these stories. Thank you!! If any of you would like to share your horror stories in the workplace, whether you've fired someone or was fired or any other insane workplace story please DM me. I would love to have it on my podcast.	We had someone call off work because his mother had passed away (no problem take time to be with your family). He then told us he felt guilty because he lied about it, he just wanted a few paid days off.
Reddit, my friends call me a scumbag because I automate my work when I was hired to do it manually. Am I?	Yes, you are a scumbag, but not because you have automated your work. You're a scumbag because you haven't helped your colleagues automate their work as well. If you brought your solution up with your managers they should reward you for improving the overall accuracy and increasing the amount of transactions. The risk is that the improvements might make some people redundant, depending on what kind of work you do, but at least you should be safe. They can't really fire you for doing a better job than the rest.	Eventually someone will realise the over 1000 a day is done by a program, everyone will then lose their jobs as the corportion realises that there is a cheaper way of doing things. But I don't think you are a scumbag for finding the most efficient way to do your job.
Teachers of Reddit, what's the most uncomfortable question that's been asked by a student while you are teaching class?	Oooh I've got a good one! I had a really stern conservative older professor once -they kind who can quell a rowdy student with a single glance. For some reason, he called his quizzes "quizzicals". One day after he announces a "quizzical" an air-headed kind of girl in the class pipes up "If you call your quizzes quizzicals, what do you call your tests?" Teacher turned the darkest shade of red I've ever seen and quickly exited the room. I suspect he never called them quizzicals again.	From a sweet little kindergarten girl: "Are you joo?" "Whats joo sweetheart?" "You know from that country, Jew people." "OH, no I'm not Jewish." "Good, cause my mommy don't like those Jew people."
You die and God asks you why He should send you to heaven. Your reply is your last comment on Reddit. What do you tell Him and how does it affect you?	I hope God is a Republican: “I believe Trump will help fix a broken system. I expect him to be attacked from all sides because of it. I stand with him. The swamp is full of dangerous vile creatures, they don’t want to go and will do anything to stay.”	> Everything is normal but at 4:20PM everyone has to watch the Bee movie I guess we will see if God likes memes or not
What is something that makes you cringe every time you think about it?	Stupid people and most of the people I see at Wal-Mart who might reproduce. Justin Bieber. Selena Gomez. Miley Cyrus. Toe thumbs. Ugly feet. Madonna, her gap teeth and anyone else that has that. 16 and Pregnant	That time I went into the bathroom, noticed there were no urinals, didn't think anything of it until I was mid-poop and a group of like 15 girls came walking in.
What was your most expensive fuck up?	I once told a lie to the U.S. population that resulting in a war costing the tax payers $6 Trillion within the next four decades. My bad. I said I was sorry, ok?	i work at a company that handles PHI (personal health info). I work in the mail room stuffing those packets. i stuffed two peoples PHIs in one packet and the company ended up getting sued for 1.2 million.
What did "the weird kid" in your school do that you will never forget?	Set fire to the bin, so I was at my chemistry class, when this kid set fire to the bin. Every student was legit standing there, watching the fire grow bigger. The teacher in charge panicked and took the nearest thing that can put the fire out which was my coffee! Should have used the water from the beakers instead but nah let's use my coffee. I will never forget this moment as I really needed the coffee since I was up all night doing my assignment.	There was a kid who shit himself running laps in gym and tried to pretend that it wasn't him. The guy has brown streaks down his leg and insisting it's not there, acting, literally, like his shit didn't stink.
Reddit, I got out of prison on friday. I was in since Feb 2008. What have I missed?	"the front page of reddit is nothing like what it was when i went in" "what's an AMA???????" **** this is complete and utter bullshit. maybe you children falling all over yourselves to believe this awesome cave-man-in-the-ice story should ask him for proof he is who he says he is, and that he's really as technology challenged ("what is this laptop thingy what is this interwebz i can has cheezburger?") as he claims to be. **** **@OP**: this is not "trolling", this is "lying". trolling is when you enter a discussion and derail the topic; it's not when you *introduce* the discussion, and then lie about everything. i don't mind that you're an annoying little middleschooler, but i do care that you're destroying the meaning of words and the art of communication.	Well I graduated from college, my wife had another kid, we've moved around a few times... Wait, did you want to know what's new with me personally or with the world in general?
What's your favorite recipe that takes less than 15 minutes to prepare?	Ordering a pizza **Ingredients**: Phone Pizza place choice and phone number Order **How to make**: Call restaurant and give them your order Wait for the pizza to arrive Enjoy!	English muffin pizzas in the toaster oven. English muffin halves as the crust, add sauce, fresh mozz (or any cheese you have on hand will work), add toppings, cook until done. Great snack!
What fucked your mind the hardest?	Trump getting elected. I looked around and wondered what the hell just happened to my country? Was physically ill for two days. And I'm not even a democrat...	That one time I was having a deja vu moment -- and remembered what happens next. *And then I watched it unfold*. Only happened once to me. Edit: I want to clarify that I've had deja vu many times before, but I've only been able to "predict" what happens next and see it unfold one time.
What is a sports-related opinion that you hold?	getting emotionally involved with other men playing a game to the point that it affects your life in a negative way is fucked up.	ESPN's Sportcenter used to keep me up to date in the sports world on the 4 major sports. Now, it is just coverage of the 6 largest cities sports teams, superstars, and touching stories. What happened to seeing every highlight package from every professional game. I don't care if it's the Minnesota Wild vs. the Florida Panthers, I just want to know what the fuck happened yesterday in sports! You blew it ESPN! You got cocky and got away from your main product and main viewer by catering to "Could-be" viewers. You gambled and lost.
What's a fun introverted thing to do on a lonely Friday night?	Introverted doesn't equal anti-social. So your question doesn't make sense because introversion has nothing to do with being lonely and avoiding people.	If I'm ever bored on a Friday night, and plan on staying in, I rearrange my apartment. It takes most of the night, you can drink while doing it, and it starts your weekend off with a different feeling and perspective.
What's your favorite mindfuck movie?	I'm honestly surprised that Interstellar hasn't been mentioned yet. I loved the use of the block world theory and the fact that the movie was just so well thought out that every time I've watched it so far I've noticed something new.	Here's a short list to get you started. These are all pretty surface level mindfuck movies that are common answers to this question. * Memento * Primer * Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind * Mulholland Drive * Moon * Being John Malcovich * Pi * Abre Los Ojos/Vanilla Sky * Inception
Those who have lost a SO to suicide, how did you deal with it?	I stopped one of my friends from suicide once. I slammed him against a nearly wall hard as I could, "That's not for you to do, that's my thing. I'll kill you when I decide to." Turns out I scared him enough to make him to realize that he want to live.	Alright, to all those who seriously reply; Ive attempted once and came close to doing it again a few times. I have a SO, I have family. Believe me, we are thinking about you, but the pain is genuinely too much. That is it, nothing more. It's a final solution, and we still love you.
What is acceptable today that you still don’t find acceptable?	Casual sex. I think it should be more meaningful. I don't hate on others for it. I just hope I raise my sons to have better morals, values and self-respect	Customers getting to act as rude as they want to any kind of employee and they get ZERO pushback because the company just cares about making money.
Reddit, what's your best "I like my _____ how I like my ______..."?	I like my women like I like my whiskey. ten years old, full of Coke and locked in my basement.	"My dad works in on an airline, and one day, a flight attendant asked the pilots if they'd like any coffee between flights. They both said yes, and she asked how they took it. The captain replied "like my women," in an attempt at humor. The flight attendant, without missing a beat, answered 'no, sir, the coffee here is free!'" - /u/Enect
What is your way of gaming the system?	I have a DirecTV subscription, yet I rarely watch the actual satellite and mostly download my TV. However, since I could TECHNICALLY have watched it on my DVR, I'm not TECHNICALLY breaking the law. Yes, I realize I could still be in the shiat if some firm decided to go after me, but I'm confident I would win out in the end. My bank account, not so much. Still, helps me get to sleep at night.	I change the channel as soon as commercials come on, so that they don't get the advertising they paid for. I know, I'm a real badass.
What dish is extremely easy to prepare, but makes you look like an incredible chef?	Pico de gayo. Chopped cilantro on a cutting board. Top everything with parsley. Just don’t serve out of a can. Most people don’t go restaurants for lazily prepared food. And for goodness sake stop frying.	Me and a load of friends did "come dine with me" it's an absolute masterpiece of a home cooking show, where contestants take it in turns to cook and entertain at their house. The other contestants score the night, and the highest score wins. I googled "easy to make fancy looking pudding" and apple roses came up. Apple and pastry that looks like a rose. Super easy, and it looked fancy.
What would the adult version of an ice-cream truck sell and what song would it play?	Books and One by Metallica, since that song is based off a movie, which is based off a book (Johnny Got His Gun).	why would it have to be different in any way? I still wanna get my ice cream from the ice cream truck as an adult.
Truckers of Reddit, what is something you have witnessed driving at night that gave you chills?	I love how half or more of these start off with not a trucker but....what don’t you mother fuckers get ! It says truckers of reddit not all yiu non truckers of Reddit	I25 south of Albuquerque, there's a huge dip, straight down one side of a canyon and up the other. I'm a very safe driver, so i took the downgrade slow and crawled up the other side with my hazards on. Looking in my mirror i see headlights from another truck at the bottom, then 2 jets of flame shoot like 20 feet into the air above it. This truck runs past me doing 80 up the slope. I didn't even know it was possible to put nitrous into a semi, i know it ain't legal, but i thought the devil himself was riding up on me.
Why do you love being the sex you are?	Being a man is fucking awesome. Society automatically looks up to you as a leader. You can make decisions that greatly effect your life and move on to bigger and better things. None of this is easy, but being a man makes it a hell of a lot easier.	If I so choose, I *never have to wear pants again*. And it would be completely socially acceptable. Edit: I am a lady. And from the rural midwest. Men don't typically wear skirts or dresses here...
[Serious] Those who lost their virginity very very late (30's, 40's etc), how did it happen?	I was thirty when I married my wife. So was she. We were both virgins until our wedding night. It was awesome. Sex is too important and special an experience to waste it on people whom you don't love or people who don't love you. A lot of people discount the value and meaning of sex, mostly to justify their own decisions. Those people are wrong.	I was/am 34. Just lost it last fall to a good friend/neighbor. We had been friends for years but never went out anywhere together. I've spent most of my adult life avoiding dating do to horrible social anxiety but am very comfortable around her. One day she suggested we go out to breakfast and I agreed. Several Bloody Marys later led to us drinking together after at my place which led to me making a move. That led to the bedroom. Now we are dating.
Employers of Reddit, what is the weirdest excuse an employee gave you for not showing up to work, that turned out to be true?	I had some one tell me "I overslept, because I was roofied". It was a guy! Lol. A few days later he showed me the video of him being roofied.	"Hey I can't come to work today. My fish is giving birth." Turns out that fish is extinct in the wild so they're worth quite a bit of money. And they eat their babies if they're left in the tank with them. No wonder they're extinct in the wild.
What's the most significant "you just fucked with the wrong person" moment you've witnessed or experienced?	"He never raised his voice. That was the worst thing... the fury of the Time Lord... and then we discovered why. Why this Doctor, who had fought with gods and demons, why he had run away from us and hidden. He was being kind..."	There's this old miserly looking man with a nickel who seems to just ride the subway all day. The nickel man only seems to have one purpose in his life, he sticks his hand out with a nickel on his palm, and he just points it at you. It's like he's asking you to look at his plain ol' nickel. He's like a reverse panhandler. One night, I was coming home drunk and saw the Nickel guy. He was doing his usual rounds, and he came to me. He stuck out his hand, and like usual you just let him be. But I was tipsy and I pulled the nickel out of his hand. Within seconds, he went from normal nickel guy to fucking crazy rip your face off yelling angry gorilla man. Till I put it back, and he became normal nickel guy again. I was mortified.
What's the worst thing you've had to pretend to like or be interested in for your SO or family member, friend etc.?	Drinking alcohol. Have a drink! Have a drink! Sorry, I'm not a functioning alcoholic. I like to have wine with a meal. I like a cocktail at a bar. Sipping a cooler while watching the fire while camping. But "Have a beer!" just for entering their house.	Remember what Vonnegut said: >“We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.”
What simple fact, if everybody knew it, would cause mass panic?	That hell existed. edit - no, I'm not saying that hell actually exists, I assumed we were talking hypotheticals. Good grief.	There are microscopic mites that live on your eyelashes, and bury themselves under the follicles. They don't like light and so they wait until night and come out onto your eyelashes to reproduce. Millions of people have them and don't even know.
Reddit, what's an opinion you have that make people look at you like you're a monster?	I think that people who are sexually attracted to children shouldn't be ostracised. Just because someone feels attracted to kids doesn't automatically mean that they'll go abduct some and rape them and post a video of it for their paedophile friends. If it was more accepted as a thing that some people just can't help, there might be more support available for those people.	I think there is too much spent on keeping people alive when there is no hope. Mostly I think this applies to old people (but I can see some younger cases also), it is going to cost $250,000 to keep granny alive and bed bound for another couple of days. Well granny had a good life, it is time to say goodbye to granny.
What is the one video game that makes you want to buy the whole console?	SNES: Mario Kart. Sega Genesis: Road Rash PlayStation: FFVII N64: Goldeneye Dreamcast: Guilty Gear X Game Cube: Smash Bros. Melee (would also accept Double Dash, Resident Evil 4, or Metroid Prime) PlayStation 2: Metal Gear Solid 3: Snakeeater, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Xbox: Halo (would also accept Dynasty Warriors) Wii: N/A Xbox 360: Orange Box, Assassin's Creed 2 PlayStation 3: Assassin's Creed 2, GTA V XBone: Fallout 4 PlayStation 4: Fallout 4 Edit: Forgot PS3: The Last Of Us. Edit 2: Forgot GTA San Andreas for PS2.	I'll pretty much always stay up-to-date with Xbox for Halo. Halo is the only thing keeping me from going full /r/pcmasterrace
What situation will always be awkward?	When you're having sex with your partner and you're doing anal. It's clean 99% of the time but this time, shit everywhere. That's the essence of awkward.	Clogging a toilet at someone else's house. Edit: I'd like to thank everyone for sharing their stories about clogging toilets at other peoples' homes. Truly an enlightening experience.
[Serious]What is the creepiest experience you or someone you know has had?	I was downstairs at night and realized that it was already 12am, so I needed to go to bed. As I was turning off the light in the hallway, there was something staring at me in the mirror. I found someone standing right behind me. But as I look back, no one was there. Then I looked at the mirror again and she was still there. She had brown hair and was wearing a white gown. Later that night, I had horrible sleep paralysis episode. I ended up crying when I finally awoke. I never experienced an episode like that since. Its been 2 years.	On my old street the boy who lived across the street from me, told me he would stare at my window at night. One evening, he came inside my house and was standing at the bottom of the stairs.
Reddit, what things have you learned about a friend that suddenly made you despise him/her?	That they not only voted for the 'W' but think he was the greatest president we've had in 40 years...	Friend of 10 years hangs out with myself, my girlfriend, and another mutual friend. Afterwards, he starts texting my girlfriend saying that she's cute and that they should fuck behind my back. Instantly cut him out of my life, tell him to fuck himself after he says that it was her that was sketchy. I saw everything that had been said, and it was very one-sided. **Edit:** A few days after he and I had this verbal altercation, he was arrested and received a DUI. No driving for 90 days. Karma might be a real thing, people.
What if I wanted to hire the homeless?	Pretty sure you can still do this for free. Rent a boat, pull up to an african dock. Throw a couple pieces of fried chicken in the hold. Once you have your desired catch, sail for home. You may need to purchase a whip from amazon.	"Is there any way I can do this without it being called slavery?" Yeah... pay them. You can charge rent for use of the houses/apt/whatever the hell they are. You can make an arrangement with the tenant/employee to deduct the rent from his paycheck. Or you can let them live there for free and just pay them fo their work. Make sure its all legal. If they are employees, then you have to look into the tax laws for employers. If they will be contractors for you, then you also have to look into those laws. Also, as a landlord, look into rental laws in your state to see your duties as a landlord and their duties as a tenant.
A man holds a gun to your head. He only says one thing, "Impress me." How do you do it?	Refuse to do anything, because I don't give in to threats made by violence, whatever the cost may be. A byproduct of this reaction is that its a pretty impressive thing to do when your life is on the line.	I would buy him the best darn silk dress I could find, buy the best damn tiara I could get on short notice, and then fit his feet into dainty slippers before being shot in the head because I misheard him.
What was the coolest thing that happened to you while no one else was looking?	Wow, it seems we all have similar stories! I once had some candy and some kids just came up all shy and everything at first, but eventually they started eating the candy and that's when things started going great! I -- uh-oh Chris Hansen just popped in, I'll tell you guys the rest later.	I was riding my bike through the woods a while ago and got my front tire stuck on a log. I started to go over, but I just sort of stepped over my handlebars as my bike went over. I literally went from crashing to walking in the same instant. I had no idea what happened for a minute. My bike didn't even hit me. So weird.
What's the best case of instant karma that you've ever seen?	Here, when people say something about gold and then log on to their other account and give themselves gold. In the real world, that pharma bro getting sentenced. Usually people get away and prosper from that kind of behavior but it seemed we needed a sacrificial goat and I’m glad at least that it was him.	Used to commute to DC from 40 miles away. Driving home one evening, this dude decides he MUST merge into my lane NOW. Beeping and all, he pushes me off the road. The car behind me was a cop. As soon as I was on the shoulder, lights and sirens went on and the dude was pulled over.
What is the smartest thing your pet ever did?	Not a pet but my six year old cousin knows a fuckton about airplanes. He can identify one by sound alone.	My dog is potty trained. She rarely messed the house before we moved. Right now we are between houses (cleaning out and fixing the new house) and living at my moms parents house. My grandma hates my dog, the feeling is mutual. My dog had been pooping in places where only my grandma is usually found, in her recliner, at her place at the table, in her room, in the kitchen where grandma cooks. And when my grandma went on a church trip for a week the pooping stopped, but when she came back it started again. My dog is purposely aggravating my grandma and I personally find it hilarious.
What do you want/need to get off your chest?	If only there was an aptly named subreddit dedicated to giving folks a venue to get things off of their chests....	I really don't like my life. I know it will get better eventually, but I don't know if I can wait.
What things annoy you that probably shouldn't?	Fat people. If some politician ran on a platform of imprisoning all the fat people in forced labour camps, I would work my ass off for them.	When a car beats me to a stop sign, and then sits there waving me to go. *Fuck you, just follow the fucking rules and go, you won...*
I just dropped a glass on the ground, and my coworker is acting like the world just ended. What are some other things that make people waaaaaay overreact?	Wearing shoes indoors - unless i've got a dog turd smeared to the sole of my left shoe AND assuming you don't have a bubble boy/daughter, I think it's reasonably ok to wear shoes inside your place.	standing up and eating in the kitchen. Like if I microwave a burrito, I will just stand in the kitchen and eat it there. People wig out because I do not pull out the fine china or some shit and sit down at the table
To all of the people who work the "late shift" at convenient stores (such as WaWa, 7/11, Quik E Mart), what is the craziest story that you have from your time working there past midnight?	A homeless guy who was friends with a tyranny hooker had the hooker press his Boobs against the glass of my glass cubicle. This was person looked like Flea with tits I shit you not.	Had a drunk guy come in fully clothed. Walked around for a minute. Stood in place for minute then head to the bathroom. When he came out he was wearing nothing but his t-shirt. Left the store hanging dong into 3 degree weather. Never saw him again.
Reddit, what's one thing you do on a daily basis that makes you ashamed, but you do it anyway?	Pay tax, and I'm not in a reveloution. I understand tax is required, but we get taxed on things we shouldn't and tax money is wasted on things we (the people) don't want it to be used on. Makes me sad, and I really don't do anything about it.	Nothing. I sit and do nothing when I should exercise. Everyday I think of this. And everyday I am ashamed.
In what ways do you subtly mess with people?	When I'm in a prime spot in a parking lot, as I'm leaving, I put the car in reverse but just stay in the parking spot for a minute or two. Just to test the patience of the car waiting to park in my spot.	When I go in for a handshake with someone I tuck my thumb in just before it happens so their hand slides up my forearm then ask them why they're trying to seduce me and tell them I'm married.
What is something everybody does but no one admits doing it?	If we're going to be honest, there's probably *nothing* everybody does, short of the basic breathing/eating/drinking/pissing/shitting functions. And people tend to be quite upfront about those. If you swap "everbody" for "most people", I think those are the most common : * masturbating * murderous/violent thoughts * suicidal thoughs Edit : have I said something stupid ? Edit^Edit : This is now my most controversial post. WTF ?	when you meet someone and ask them what their name is but forget to fuckin listen to the name so you have to pretend you know it until someone else calls them by their name.
What makes you a pervert?	It sickens me to say this, but, most guys are like that, it's not cause they're pervs it's in nature or something like that, some guys aren't like that, but yeah it's just guys >.< and girls and hormones	If all you think about is sex and you see everyone as a sexual object. I've got a case of it myself.
What is the most statistically improbable thing that has happened to you?	I am. Same for every one of you. For 14,000,000 years molecules have been arranging to for you and me at this exact moment. It's extraordinarily amazing that we exist.	Before cell phones, when I was a kid getting a haircut, the barber shop's phone rang, the receptionist answered it and said "Just a second, I'll check." Then she asked if anyone in the shop was named eriotto, so I took the phone (had to stick my arm out through the cape) and it was my cousin, who asked if she could come over and play. She was confused when I told her I was at the barber shop. It turned out the phone number there was only different from my home number by one digit. TL;DR: someone called me, dialed wrong, and I happened to be at the place they dialed.
What was the worst "why the f*** did I say that" moment?	One time in high school, there was this girl I had dated in the past who was starting to drink alchohol and hang out with people I wasn’t a big fan of. One day while in the halls of our school she described an instance where she had embarrassed herself in front of a large crowd of people recently, and I muttered under my breath that she, “was probably drunk”. Needless to say, there were some people upset at me that day	In 8th grade, there was this pretty girl that I sat next to who had a reputation for being depressed and sleeping around. In retrospect, she probably had a lot of emotional issues from her upbringing. One day, she asked me, “What would you do if I died?” The first that came to mind was: “I’d probably use your desk to put my books on”
Cops of Reddit, what are some of the best/worst ways people have tried to get out of getting a ticket from you?	Not a cop but one time I got pulled over by this little midget cop and I (all 6'8" of me) decided to ask if I could get out of the car and if she would like to hop on my shoulders to see the world from that high up. At first she was offended but I explained it was nothing demeaning or anything, and after a little convincing she hopped right up! She even requested I walk around town with her up there for a bit. We were a huge hit with the crowds (this was saturday night in downtown) and I'm proud to say 6 months later, we're now engaged! The kicker of the whole thing? That little meatball still gave me the ticket! Gotta love her though haha.	My dad was pulled over going way, WAY too fast on the interstate late at night (like 1-2am). He is an anesthesiologist, and got called in to work because someone had been shot. It turned out that the person who had been shot was a cop, and so not only did my dad not receive a ticket, he got a police escort to the hospital and he has refused to tell me exactly how fast they went. Hearing that story as a kid made me think my very by-the-book awkward dad was super cool.
What's a "don't knock it till you tried it" thing that you have continued to do?	My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. It's a bit hard to explain, but watching that show has somehow triggered a paradigm shift inside my brain and now my outlook on life is the best it's been in years.	Brushing my teeth in the shower. A redditor mentioned it, and I tried it out of curiosity. I love the feeling of stepping out of the shower 100% clean.
Teachers of Reddit, what is the most rigged school competition you have ever witnessed?	Not a teacher, but when I realized that I'm not a teacher I decided that I shouldn't submit a comment to a question asked of teachers. Then I changed my mind.	Fire drill contest. Fastest school wins. However the school with 2 stories and 3 grades doesn’t get any more time than the schools with 1 story and 2 grades.
[Serious]Redditors who have had to kill in self defense, Did you ever recover psychologically? What is it to live knowing you killed someone regardless you didn't want to do it?	I wish people here on reddit even understood what serious meant in the first place. From all the bullshit posts that are just flat out impossible in the first case with massive upvotes, I really really lose all hope for mankind in the first place.	I got assaulted in an alley in New Orleans 20 years ago. The guy hit me in the back of the head, cut me a few times with a knife, put the knife to my throat and told me that he was going to rape and kill me. I choked him to death. Felt his windpipe crumble in my hands. I've had PTSD ever since. Constant nightmares. I see his face turn red, blue, and purple. I hear the crunch of his windpipe. I feel him struggle against me. I have scars I see every time I get out of the shower. I did what I had to do and don't regret it but killing a man with your bare hands is a lifelong struggle.
Tech support of Reddit, What is the most common misconception about computers?	Restarting the computer ***doesn't FIX anything***. It bandaids a software and/or hardware problem *temporarily* until the circumstances are right and it can happen again. I wish people would stop parroting that asinine piece of "wisdom" like it meant anything.	Oh good there are so many... I've had numerous people think you can download the site and have access even if you are offline and the data will be current.
I claimed a Black person from Nebraska must have been "Imported". What's the most offensive thing you've accidentally said to someone?	I asked a black co-worker if he would like to be my slave. It started out as a convo about my hubby and the chores he does around the house and co-worker said I was a slave-driver and I said, "Wouldn't you want to be my slave?" all flirty like, lol.	Do-gooder in the street: "Hi, I'm collecting money to give to the disabled" Me: Well don't give it to me, I've got legs. I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
i just read one of my COLLEGE student's (I'm a ta) essay's which said that Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in retaliation for the US dropping the bomb on Hiroshima. Anyone else have a depressing example of education failures?	My mom was a Catholic elementary school teacher and when I would pick her up every afternoon I would great her by saying: "So mom, how was your day today LYING to the kids!" (about creationism). She would of course scold me and laugh it off. Thing is he knew the truth but that damn school curriculum keeps her handcuffed. So sad.	Had to proof-read a fellow students essay. Her essay was about the Sep. 11th, 2001 attack and how "millions died on that fateful day" I just wrote "Are you sure?" and moved on.
What's the most important cooking mistakes that people make?	Not letting meat get to room temperature before cooking it. It really does make a huge difference. Oh and not letting their meat rest.	Deciding that they can ignore the recipe despite the fact they know they can't cook. I see people who go "Oh, I can't cook." and then try and follow a recipe and go "Oh, if I do this instead it'll probably be ok." They'll decide they can change an ingredient, or miss one out, or change cooking times and temperatures, despite the fact that they are fully aware they don't know what they're doing, and somehow think that's fine.
Soldiers of reddit, what is something you wish you had known before joining the military?	I'm not in the military, but I'm pretty sure many of them would have liked to have known their commander in chief making decisions with their lives on the line would be a mentally ill reality TV star.	You will be responsible for millions of dollars worth of equipment and be treated like a child at the same time
People who have worked on horror movies, how scary (or not) was it on-set?	Not scary at all. In part because the movie was pretty shit and too this day still hasn’t fully released apart from a few festival screenings. But it was fun and I got to work with some semi-famous people (the brother of a really amazing actor and another guy who’s more famous to people in that specific role). But a lot of it because I was doing special effects and was helping create the scares so I knew exactly how fake everything was and knew that if they had just tweaked the shots in a few minor ways, all of the illusions we created would have totally shattered.	Not scary at all. Not only do you know what's coming but you have to do multiple takes of everything. Dying for like the 14th time really kind of takes the impact out of it.
[Serious] What is the most absurd thing that someone (or a company) owns because of a copyright or trademark?	A genetic variety of corn. The problem is when nature does its thing, and pollinates other crops that are non-GMO, that farmer is committing copyright infringement, and has to pay royalties, or destroy their crop.	The NFL actually has a trademark on the phrase "Super bowl". That's why when the super bowl comes around you see "Game Day" or the like when it comes to any promotions or bars talking about viewing parties
Kids Say The Darndest Things- What is the funniest thing you have heard a child say?	Kid: My mom wanted me to ask you "Are you my daddy"? Me: **HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH...*breathe* Whew lil' nigga that was a good one.	Supervising a group of children on a field trip. Black kid comes up to me. "Sir, David just said the N word." Me: "Err... the *N* word?" "Nipples"
Men of reddit, what is your #MeToo story?	I was making out with a friend who made it clear we weren't going to take off any clothes and she didn't want her breasts/butt/crotch touched. After a while I thought it would be funny to poke her breast, and she got really angry and called me out for it. Obviously not the kind of sexual assault to get locked up for, but it was still sexual assault and the normalization of "lesser" behavior is part of what leads to people escalating their behavior. Was a bit of a slap in the face to realize I was capable of the kind of rationalization of behavior that starts you down the path to seriously harming someone. I know most men will talk about when they were assaulted, but I find the other side of the discussion to be important too.	I was raped on and off from ages 8-11 by a family member. When I finally told, they cut ties with him but my family blocked me from pressing legal charges. He became a cop and now is in charge of keeping people safe, and that makes me sick.
What kindness have you done for someone that backfired so badly you will never do anything like that ever again?	I once stole my $3000 dollars from my brother in law to get woman's wigs and clothing so I could leave my wife and student debt behind me. On my way to the air port the cab driver called me a "freak" and laughed at me. Ill never look at cab drivers the same. I also bought McDonalds for a homeless man.	I was once in a situation where I was out of work for a while and could no longer afford my apartment. A friend of mine said I could stay with him until I found a new place to live. He wouldn't accept any money from me so I decided to show my appreciation by cleaning his place and filling the fridge with groceries. When he got home he proceeded to flip a nut, screaming at me for touching his things. He then threw all the food I had bought in the trash.
If Buzz Lightyear doesn't think he's a toy, why doesn't he speak when humans are around?	Plot Holes. There's a lot more of them in our favorite films. For example... ...In Holes-The same court sent two kids to Camp Green Lake, both for stealing the same pair of shoes. Instead of rejecting Stanley's story, they should've put 2 and 2 together and realized Zero was the thief, and Stanley was a victim of circumstance. In Frozen-Elsa's power are NEVER explained. Also, she's a God. She can create life. Elsa is a God. In Battlefield Earth-They're able to pilot jets that have been sitting idle for a millennium. In Men In Black 3-If the ArcNet, specifically designed to prevent earth from invasion, was put up in 1969, how did the first two films happen? In Signs-The Aliens only have one weakness: water. WHY IN THE SHIT DO THEY TRY TO INVADE THE ONE PLANET THAT'S OVER 2/3 OF THE ONE THING THAT CAN KILL THEM!?!?	A delusional mind can rationalize anything in order to maintain its illusion. Buzz freezes around humans because he is paralyzed by the powerful, near-insurmountable instinct that all toys feel in the presence of a creator species. However, he can easily justify his actions afterwards. "I just didn't feel like moving", he might say, or "sudden movements could antagonize this large, potentially dangerous being", or even "I was displaying a stationary Mhgr'reshian Battle Pose to frighten the creature away". You can argue and persuade and cajole all you want, but Buzz can incorporate any environmental stimuli into his worldview because his reality stems from a carefully manufactured self image. It's not until his self image is torn apart (literally, through the loss of a limb) that the illusion collapses and he is forced to face the reality of his existence.
Frequent flyers of reddit, what are some tips for plane rides?	On most planes, the arm of the aisle seat has a button below it to raise it up. Makes getting off the plane easier if the arm is up so you aren't trying to schooch over it while juggling your carry ons. For long flights, hand the flight crew a nice box of chocolates (sealed) as you board. They may find you a nicer seat or forget to charge you for wine and beer (I think the harder booze is inventoried better...). Maybe not, but it always is a good bet to treat the attendants politely.	This is aimed at Europeans especially. Always check the distance from the airport to the city. Ultra lowcost airlines in Europe (especially Ryanair) often fly to smaller airports as far as 100km away from the destination. Transit to the city often costs 2-3x more as the ticket, so in the end, it's often better to fly with a classic airline.
What do people do that you hate, but you actually do yourself?	Being overly pervy toward women. Sitting here at my computer, I know it's wrong and I wish all guys would be respectful toward them, but when it's hot out and the beautiful women come out of the woodwork in their sundresses or short-shorts with crop tops, I'm always leering, catcalling, and/or saying things like "Very nice!" or " *That's* what I like." I'm a weak, weak man.	Whine about minor things, it really gets me going. But here I am having a cold and oh my ...
What's the worst date you've ever been on?	I went on a date with a girl who complained about my dog. I pulled over and let her out on the side of the road.	When I was younger, I went on a date with this guy I met through a mutual friend. We ended up going to the mall for a bit to kill some time before our movie. While we were walking around, I hear a girl from the floor above us yell his name. He looked up, made this weird face, grabbed my hand and we ran like hell. I was so confused and I asked him what that was about. While still running he says to me "that's the bitch I fingered!".
What's the trashiest chain resturant?	The only correct answer is White Castle. The only reason anyone goes to White Castle is because the food is so vile it is guaranteed to make you vomit up all that alcohol that is going to poison you if you don't purge it.	This is DEFINITELY an Australian thing. But motherfcking *Smorgy's*. An absolute shit show of a buffet where everything pretty much looked and tasted like cardboard and all the tables were either greasy or sticky, never in between. But my god it was the best place to go to as a kid. All the fries, ice cream and plastic jello you could ever want, plus each one had an animatronic show in the middle of the restaurant. They closed down eventually, but from what I heard it was because they could no longer hide the rat or cockroach problem or something along those lines. There was even a rumour at my school that some kid died while climbing the talking tree. It was magical place.
What is the dumbest conspiracy theory somebody has tried to convince you about?	God. I'm not being flip and not trying to be offensive. The whole idea of God just seems extraordinarily ridiculous to me.	My mom is convinced that the government forces you to buy the new twisty type of lightbulbs so that your Caller ID doesn't work. She also told me in high school that we couldn't get the internet because the phone lines (dial-up) connect you to the devil.
Doctors and nurses of Reddit who have delivered babies to mothers who clearly cheated on their husbands, what was that like?	About 5 years ago I delivered a baby to a Caucasian couple, but the baby was obviously mixed. When the husband saw the baby he looked at his wife and said "Can you believe this idiot is reading this Reddit comment thinking they are going to get a juicy story?" Edit: wouldn't you like to know	I was assisting at a Caesarian when I was a junior doctor. The woman’s dark skinned partner had been in prison 9 months or so. I took the baby immediately upon delivery and announced cheerily “It’s a boy!” Her first words were “Is it black?” Luckily the baby was a mocha colour that could have gone either way, and I told her in a mildly confused manner “Ahhh, it could be?”
Atheists of Reddit, what questions do you have for religious people?	I just... How? How do you rationalise all the abuse and inaccuracies if not for human invention? How could a perfect, loving God be the god of a world filled with so much random horrible shit?	Has the notion that if you were born in a different geographic region you'd most likely have a different religion ever bothered any religious folk here?
Wheelchair users of Reddit: What basic principles of WC etiquette do you wish everyone would follow?	I'm not in a wheelchair but my 9 year is and when you see me pushing him in a store, would be nice if you didn't take the whole isle and being rude when I run over your feet because you decided to be in my way	Just b/c I am does not automatically mean that I am also blind, deaf, and have an IQ of 30. Don't stand too close or speak too loudly. I'm just fine minus the wheelchair part
People who sat in an exit row on a plane and your duties were called upon. How well did you do?	The whore in 3A got mad because I let her baby drown. Fuck 'em both. I wanted a smaller life vest so I wouldn't lose my beer. Maybe if she lifted a few weights, or fought harder, she wouldn't have a dead baby right now!	I sit in the exit rows on Southwest flights because it has more leg room, but in all seriousness why do they let you drink in those sections? I drink on pretty much every flight and it would never be a problem for me because I don't get hammered but you'd think for safety concerns that if you decide to drink they'd take you off of those rows. IDK just a thought.
Fast-food workers of reddit, what's something all your customers should be aware of?	Not in fast food anymore, but if you pissed me off and you just so happened to be middle eastern(the one's who were nice were safe) I'd say the pepperoni we used for the pizza was beef when in fact it was all pork	Fuck that stupid "secret menu" bullshit, tell me what you want, ill fucking make it, dont ask for a "double mcstuffins coffee quarter pounder macr fries with special sauce" just because you got it off buzzfeed doesnt mean we all know what tf that is.
Germans of Reddit, what is the family environment like when a grandpa or other close relative used to be in the Nazi regime? Is it just ignored?	Not a German but living in Germany for 30 years. The standard answer is: "my grandfather was there but he had no choice. It seems 100 thousands of them just has no choice, because all the other 100 thousands had also no choice." Honestly I hate this answer. A lot of people died and soooo many *just accepted* this? I am aware that it's not that easy - that's why the answer "had no choice" is a bit too easy.	My great grandfather was a soldier, but he was not really supportive of the regime. Many interesting stories though, that man put hollywood action heros to shame. It wasn't ignored in my family, I was educated about the gritty stuff early on.
Redditors, what's one thing people would never know about you just by looking at you?	That I am extremely "dark and twisty." On the inside. I'm a blonde haired green eyed conservatively dressing middle class suburban woman. You'd think that I would be all Nicholas Sparks and Hallmark movies. I love horror stories and movies, true crime (the worse the better) shows like CSI and Criminal Minds. Almost everything that I have read in the past year has been some sort of murder mystery. I also love disaster documentaries and books about disasters.	That I have anxiety. I look like a lean-back, cool person... I usually don't *look* stressed out, even when I am... until I start talking
What's something everyone thinks is great, but is actually a scam?	Money. The only thing that makes it work is our collective belief that it should. But really, its meaningless and arbitrary. Some people will then bring up the gold standard as meaning something. I then point out that they are giving arbitrary value to shiny metal. People tend to be hostile to this revelation.	School pictures. Especially now in the age of very good cameras, smartphones and touch up tools. Seriously, as a parent, I can tell you that I really don't cherish my kids' 3rd grade school pictures anymore than the 10,000 terrific candid shots we took from our vacation that year. We don't even pay up front anymore, they always take the pictures at the school anyway even if you don't pay. They send you the proofs trying to get post-sales. So if they come out great, buy a few, but otherwise, skip it. Just get a high school graduation shot if you must. The rest are a ripoff.
Reddit, what was your first kiss like?	We were hanging out and I was lounged on the couch. She jumped on me and bit me on the neck (because she was crazy like that and I liked it anyway). I turned my head down towards her's as she came back up and it just happened. It was a strange relationship, best friends for 4 years before we actually got together properly. Then it ended cause she went crazy religious.	Mine was depressing. I was in 7th grade and she was in 8th. We made out for a few seconds then it was done. The kiss itself was meh, but later I would find out that she had to kiss me because she lost a bet and the kids she lost to thought I was gay. So yeah it sucked that she didn't even like me or anything and everyone thought I was gay because I had a combover.
Has someone ever said something to you that will haunt you forever, or that has changed you forever?	I was being a 7 year old in the grocery store and my dad turned and told me I was being a pill. It was his voice that just let me know I was in extreme trouble and should stop. Another time I was being 12 when my mom's dad was in town. My mom got really close to my ear and whispered in a venomous voice "you are being a little shit and I want you to stop". I did, never heard he say anything "worse" than crap, which she didn't like to say.	A few years ago I was at the store with my dad. We were about to get in the check out line but he realized he forgot to grab something. I stayed up front with the buggie and wait on him. While I'm standing there I make eye contact with an older gentlemen so I smile at him. I will never forget how that mans eyes lit up. He walked over to me, shook my hand, and thanked me. That thank you really impacted me. I brightened this mans day just by smiling. Now I make it a point to smile at everyone I make eye contact with regardless of my mood.
Guys, what turns you away from girls?	Highly insecure girls to the point of paranoid jealousy. And of course, narcissism with a dash of bitchiness. Need I say more?	A lack of honesty. Just tell me how you truly feel and I can handle it, there's no need to dance around subjects or lie if we're together or one of us wants to be with the other.
What did you find out about your S/O after moving in with them, good or bad?	She had borderline personality disorder. That's very, very, very bad. LPT: never start a relationship with an inhuman monster, who lives to devour human souls.	Bad: He won't clean anything unless I specifically ask him to, he just doesn't realize the dishes are stacking up, or that there's shit everywhere. And that makes me seem super naggy all the time. Good: He is super patient with me and my bad moods, and gives me space when I need it. He also tries all the random shit I cook and he's honest with me as to whether he likes it or not.
My parents just received a certified envelope in the mail from someone we do not know. All that was inside the envelope was a cashier's check for $1,000. No notes inside. We called the bank and it is apparently legit. Could this be a scam of some sort or is it random kindness?	why is nobody stating the simple fact that the money obviously doesn't belong to them? if it was issued by mistake and you cash it you're still stealing. do the right thing and tear it up.	This is my guess as to how this scheme will play out. You will go to the bank and have the check payed out. The sender will now call you and ask kindly to not cash the check as it was sent by mistake. You will inform him that it was already cashed. He will say "oh my, would it be possible for you to send me the cash. It was truly a mistake, please keep $200-$100 dollars for your troubles." Feeling bad for this poor soul you send him the cash, and a few days later you get a message from the bank saying "sorry, the check you cashed was made fraudulently, please return the $1000."
What is a question a child has asked you that you just don't have the answer to?	Im a teacher and i never have good answers when kids ask about dress codes. I just enoforce them because im supposed to but i really dont care about what theyre wearing	I'm not good with kids. I used to work in this restaurant where the chef's wife would stop by some afternoons and bring their daughter. Not 100% on daughter's age, but not yet in primary school. Anyway, the daughter takes a shine to me, and to my amazement, I actually manage to engage with a child. For the first time. Mother says "Oh, you're good with kids. Why don't you hang out with [DAUGHTER] while I go talk to [HUSBAND]?" She leaves. First thing out of the kid's mouth: "Why do dogs have to die?" "... Uhhhh"
Whats the most fucked up thing youve ever done?	Catfishing. I was pretending to be a girl about his age on an online game, but he was 10 years older than me. I pretended to be into him and he bought it. Better yet, he fell madly in love, broke up with his current gf at the time, shot down all girls that approached him... for a few years. Then I told him I would come and join him, shortly before christmas (the pretend girl lived on the other side of the country). That day I "broke up" with him. The story is messed up all around, with many more twists and turns than I can write down in a single sitting. Long story short, I catfished him so bad that he killed himself.	I've told this story before. I posted an ad on Craigslist as a man wanting to watch my wife get railed by another man. Within minutes, I had over 100 emails. I emailed about half of them back and asked them to meet "us" at the local Starbucks but to wear a blue shirt to recognize them. I then headed there to watch the madness unfold. About 20 or so showed. It looked like a blueberry clusterfuck. One guy even walked in and saw all the blue shirts and realized he was getting played and ran back to his car.
What is an interesting lesser known word you like (and its definition)?	anachronism. It means a temporal error in a story. I just use it whenever I mean acronym and so far nobody has called me out on it lol. "Did you know that TIME is just an anachronism for The International Magazine of Events?"	**Tmesis** - when you put a word inside another word for effect. * e.g. Abso-fucking-lutely, in-bloody-credible, etc. *Fun fact: It is the only word in the English language which starts with 'tm'*
Ongoing sexual harassment from my landlord is making me extremely uncomfortable. What options do I have here?	I'm sorry but I fucking hate these posts. "Reddit, I believe the man I live with is a sexual predator who is constantly making unwanted, creep sexual advances. What do I do?" How old are you? 10?! Fucking leave or alert the authorities. I'm sorry you're in this situation but this is common sense 101.	>He got my room mate a Hello Kitty poster, telling her that he knows she likes Hello Kitty. The only Hello Kitty things she owns are 7 pairs of Hello Kitty underwear. Whoa whoa whoa, time to go!
What did the the drunkest person do at your party last night?	The drunkest person yesterday was my SO’s 6 yo brother who had a serious sugar rush from all the candy and soda we gave him. 6 year olds are weird by default so nothing out of the ordinary happened. Well, he fell asleep surprisingly early. That was a bit weird.	He tried to puke in the trashcan but missed and threw up all over the window behind it. Then he yelled "looks like someone spilled the salsa" then he fell over slamming his head into a bowl of chips sending chips everywhere
My father passed away 3 years ago. Sometimes I look up our old house on Google Maps to see his truck still parked in our driveway. Reddit, what unexpected instances of technology has helped you to remember your passed loved ones?	My drawing teacher, Mark Aguhar, killed himself last year. Despite the fact that I barely knew him, I lost my shit when I realized that I had a picture of a portrait of him on my phone. I think I cried for the first time in years.	I really hate to tell you this, but Google just announced they're updating about 200,000 miles worth of street view data. If you find solace in these pictures, I would take screen shots as soon as possible in case that location is included.
Pizza delivery men of reddit, what was the scariest or creepiest thing you experienced while delivering a pizza?	Tripping into a time machine set to 1000 years in the future. The guy's name was I. C. Weiner. What kinda name is that? When I woke up, there was a 1-eyed alien with big boobs and yoga pants. Weird...	Penis (erect) hanging out of the mail slot with a sticky note on top that said: Money is under the doormat, here's you're tip. Police were involved, and my Manager was actually upset I didn't leave the pizza, and get the money for it.
Reddit, what was your video game moment of glory?	True story: mine was beating this chick in goldeneye with a bunch of our friends around. Everyone else has given up and it was just us left. We made a bet that if I won she would suck my pre-teen weenis. I won and she totally followed through. In front of all of our friends. It was both of our first experience sexually, terribly awkward. She gagged as soon as it went in her mouth. I should have married that girl. Brb, looking her up on Facebook.	Friend kept on beating me at smash bros. In a moment of trash talking he said "we should play Soul Calibur so I can beat you at that too." I'm good at Soul Calibur. I'm **VERY** good at Soul Calibur.
What is the best wager you've ever seen someone win/lose?	Someone bet that I couldn't survive a gun shot to the face. Niggers, I am Randall, I can do whatever.	Playing some snowboarding game on Play Station. Loser had to wear my dog's Invisible Fence collar through the electrified field. My friend, who lost, actually foamed at the mouth a little.
The cartoon movie Aladdin has one female character. What realizations of childhood movies made you scratch your head?	This just in! Movies never have an equal representation of genders, races, and classes. Later to come this evening, Do you think all movies portray reality? The results might shock you.	Whole families rarely make it through a Disney movie. Many have one parent from the start (Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin) Sometimes one of the parents dies, like Lion King. They aren't big fans of two parent households.
What is the funniest instance of "rage quitting" you have ever experienced?	I was fighting this huge epic battle. There were so many people involved. I can't really go into detail. But this one guy on the enemy team was trying to "purify the human race" or something, but he wasn't winning the battle. So pretty much at the end of the fighting, he ran into his bunker and killed himself. We Allies won.	Don't even know what caused it, but I was playing Halo 3 with a friend of mine who is relatively well known for his anger issues. Someone killed him (or the match ended and we had lost or something) and over the headset, I heard "aaaaaAAAHHHHHHH" followed by a "mmmyoink" as he literally bit through the cord to his mic.
Is it wrong for a guy to use coupons in a date?	Can I point out that, once you're *not* in the "Forever A Virgin" group, you can't get back in? Also, if a guy used a coupon with me, that's cool, but don't only take me places that you have coupons for. It makes me feel like you don't think I/my time is worth going somewhere unless it's cheap.	"Oh, ok. I won't use the coupon. Of course, I'm only going to be paying for my half of the meal. Good night."
Men that have been sexually assaulted, how did you cope with it and how did people you told react ?	If there's one thing the bullshit hypocrisy of #MeToo has taught me, is that women are really convinced (and therefore don't give a shit) men don't get sexually assaulted every day too. Because women are all fragile and lady-like and boo hoo etc. A Harvard study found that over 70% of domestic violence incidents are started by THE WOMAN. Yeah. Let that one sink in against your preconceived notions. What other bullshit is going on that doesn't get reported because it happens to men. So sick of this massive imbalance by the media. Nobody gave a shit about Terry Crews saying he got assaulted by being grabbed in the groin by some female exec or whatever, because noooooo, gotta focus on the women here. No wonder men are unlikely to open up, suffer from depression etc more.	As a 13 year old boy in 1973, my 25 year old male cousin assaulted me. Long story short.... I got back at him by signing him up for 120 magazine subscriptions through Publisher's Clearinghouse. Took him years to fix and ruined his credit rating. I never told anyone until 2001, when I told my dad. Dad got really quiet. My cousin and dad were best friends at the time of the assault.
Social Security Says I am deceased, how can I fix this?	Before I assist you are you sure you aren't actually dead? What if you are a intellectual zombie? We can never be too careful!	The Social Security system has good methods for dealing with this. Just use the SS computer system to enter what you need done. Be polite, they deal with stuff like this all day, every day.
What's a red flag that you choose to ignore about someone, and how did it turn out?	I always said that being messy was a dealbreaker for me. I started dating a woman who was extreeeeeeeeemely messy. We now live together and I suffer the consequences of overlooking the red flag every day.	My wife of 22 years was hanging out with a guy at work. Said his mom died and he was having a hard time. I've never been a control freak, she can have friends, I trust her. She's getting texted at 3am. I ask if anything is going on, she swears nothing is. I trust her. 2 decade marriage. Glad she's being a good friend. Valentine's day. I sneak out of bed early to go get her flowers. Her phone is blinking in the living room. I check it. Dick pics. Her pics. Nasty texts about what they've been doing. She didn't get flowers. Divorce was finalized in 3 months.
You are about to die, you are surrounded by everyone you have ever known, and have one last sentence, what do you say?	Jesus Christ, son of Man and the Living God, is the Savior of my Soul, and my hope and faith rest in Him.	This reminds me of author Roald Dahl's last words. He was surrounded by his family, and said "You know I'm not frightened- It's just I will miss you all so much..." And then a nurse injected him, and he screamed out "OW, Fuck!" and died.
What is your most clever insult?	Usually if its a girl I don't like,I'd say, "Omg, are you okay? You look sooooo tired!" Or "What's wrong? Have you been crying?" Fucks. With. Their. Minds. So. Bad. She could've just left the mall from a makeover, looking like a million bucks but ask her if she's been crying, she'll think she looks like dirt.	My friend claimed he was gonna be a famous rapper. I told him that the only thing he was gonna rap was some burgers at Burger King.
What fucked up thing did your school do?	My public grade school forced us each morning, while we children were sleepy-headed and especially brainwash vulnerable, to recite a propaganda script of nationalism pinned with religious righteousness.	Junior High: students were locked into the lunch area during lunch period to prevent students roaming the halls. I didn't realize how dangerous it was (e.g. in case of fire) until one day some kid poured superglue in one of the locks as a prank and everyone started to get claustrophobic and freak out.
For anyone who stopped giving a fuck, what were the results?	Well I can't tell you much cause I'm not supposed to talk about it, but I met a crazy bitch who was bat shit crazy, quit my job, moved into an abandoned house in a failed housing development, started a club with a friend where we beat the shit out of each other, learned you have to live life in the moment, and started a small revolution.	True story: I've been incredibly stressed these past few weeks. I've been trying to get a job before rent next month. Anyway, after countless interviews trying to look and act my best, I stayed up all night watching tv and eating ramen because fuck it. I don't shower in the morning, I don't change my clothes. I just grab a resume, stuff it in my pocket, and head out the door to a group interview I found on Craigslist. I was half asleep the entire time. I got the job. I honestly felt like Red in the Shawshank Redemption.
What was the most expensive thing you accidentally broke?	On a schooltrip. Guy checking out his Day 1 new Galaxy S5 (back then). Managed to kick it out of his hands while playing football.... if he just played with us instead of checking his smartphone.	A hydraulic lift cylinder on my crane at work.. About forty grand plus who knows how much to overnight an 8 ton chunk of steel from Italy to Canada.
what is your "oh no, I have been brainwashed my whole life" moment?	Education does not teach you truth...it teaches you lies of diminished intensity. This usually gets downvoted bc people think Im disrespecting education...but Im not. Remember when you were a kid and the science teacher said "there are plants, animals, and inanimate objects and thats it". Then a few years later you read in a book that there is this thing called the virus that doesnt meet the previously taught criteria of a living thing(most notably bc they cant exactly reproduce with there own machinery). Ok so then we learned that what we were taught earlier was a lie...but a necessary lie to allow your brain to develop remedial knowledge before building on it. So...education is learning lies of diminished intensity.	When I was 16 my mother was slowly dying from cancer. She went into a kind of coma, but shortly before she did that, she told me, that the man I believed was my father wasn't. She had cheated on him back then, and he knew, but they stayed together anyway. This could be a nice story about a man forgiving his wife, but in reality he abused and tortured both me and my mother because of it, from the day I was born, until she died and I cut him out of my life. The brainwashing part being, that I lived for 16 years believing that I was a awful, disgusting child, that deserved al of his abuse, because I couldn't make him love me, like he loved my sister.
Yesterday, I witnessed a coworker Yahoo-search Google just to type in a URL in the Google search box. What's the dumbest thing you've seen in your workplace?	Oh wow, these people are making computer mistakes. I hope it doesn't hurt your vaginas to watch. I thought I'd see a thread full of "My motor hand was high on coke while spinning the chain." or "This guy was hammered drunk operating heavy equipment." This is just a list of people who don't know things that you know. It has nothing to do with stupidity or intelligence.	Where I work, there are simply too many to list. The most common one I've seen... Middle of a presentation surrounded by co-workers. Laptop of the presenter goes to sleep. Co-worker freaks and starts pressing the power button. Nothing happens. They press the power button faster, as if the rate of speed will usually fix it... Furious and panicked, they literally POUND on the button with their fist yelling that the manufacturer of the laptop can't seem to produce a single quality piece of hardware... Finally, someone reaches over and plugs the power cable back in. At which point I simply get up, and walk out.
Reddit, what's a shallow reason you wouldn't date someone?	if they wont give blowjobs, its pretty much a deadset no for me. another thing is probably birth control - if i have to continue using a condom for the duration of our relationship theres just no way im ever going to commit to anything monogamous. until theres a good alternative for me to use myself that doesnt completely numb all sensations until climax im likely going to pass unless there is a really good reason and im totally infatuated with them. id happily take the birth control myself but its just not a practical option afaik yet.	She repeated everything like Jimmy Two Times in Goodfellas. "Let's go to the beach. Go to the beach." "I have to work a double. Work a double."
What's your 'it's a small world' story?	Several years ago, after I graduated college, I was visiting Prague. I was on a walking tour with a bunch of other tourists and started talking to an older couple. It turns out they were also from Colorado. They asked where I graduated from and i told them. They then asked me if I knew their son, who was at the same school. It turns out that he was the guy I'd bought weed from for like 2 years. So after I nearly choked on my water I just said that yes, I did know him. Still weirds me out to this day.	Took a trip to California from the east coast. Met a girl at the hotel bar. Started chatting it up and hit it off. We went for dinner and drinks the next night and ended up hooking up. Couple days later I had to fly back home to the east coast. We kept in touch for a couple weeks via phone and face time. We made plans for her to come visit. The day before her flight we joked and decided we should become Facebook friends. We actually have mutual friends... she knows my mom... she knows my aunts... I ask my mom how she knows this girl... shes my cousin.
People that have used "Hardcore" Drugs, How does it feel? is the media portrait of the effects accurate?	For the most part. Acid is actually one of the safest "street drugs" around along with shrooms. As long as you dont go overboard. Heroin is not dangerous unless you mix it with benzos (xanax) or alchohol but it IS extremely addictive. PCP is can cause some people to trip out and go ballistic like its portrayed to do. Meth and Coke are highly addictive but can be used as true "recreational drugs" by the right person. Heroin feels great at first then after a month of using it gets old, same with meth and cocaine. If you can use drugs socially then the effects are always better but be very wary. ADDICTION can touch ANYONE. Im from Metro Detroit and a large number of former friends have or have had drug problems. Overall the media does portray opiate and meth addiction accurately	I was addicted to Opana's. It felt wayyy better than heroin. It has killed more of my old friends than heroin has. Stay the fuck away from it. Sober since December 2012!
Redditors, how do you shake yourselves out of it when your brain goes into a spiral of negativity?	I read the Bible, praying, listen to worship music, or go do something I know Jesus wants me to. It's hard to be unhappy when you are living according to your created purpose and God loves you so much He died for you and you get to live forever with Him. The atheist I used to be would have a fit I am here saying this stuff now hahaha	I start thinking of it like it's a random thought. I call out my double standards. Basically, I'll never judge someone for x so why am I judging myself?
Sending a guitar down under. Have extra room in the box. What should I surprise the buyer with from the states?	Rattlesnake ;-) there isn't any anti-venom down here..... let's see if any one is old enough to remember the reference.	For the love of all that's holy detune the strings. I mean until they are sloppy, sloppy loose. As a former baggage handler I've seen how things are treated and the cold in the cargo holds will contract the metal strings and snap the neck of the guitar. The jarring during the loading may as well. Other packing tips. Unless it's a plastic hard shell case, stuff it full of rags under the neck and inside the body as well as all around the instrument. This will add cushioning outside and support inside if something heavy (like ten other bags or boxes) is placed on top of it. You'll thank me later. Edit: Sorry for the quad post. My Chrome/RES/ Sat internet combo does that sometimes.
What are some of the ridiculous rules of your HOA?	HOAs are like Republicans and 'twinkies'; some people in my country are aware that they exist and, while we don't really understand them, we are glad they are confined to the US.	Cars cannot sit in the same spot for more than a week. You must move it to show that it is not broken.
Reddit, why is your roommate the worst?	Shrieks like an autistic barbarian every morning at 7am, leaves food spilled everywhere, chews on all my stuff, and shits on my desk all the time. Parrots make terrible roommates. Good thing they're cute	Ugh. She and her date busted down our front door by kicking it in and ramming their bodies against it while I was asleep in my room. She lost her keys (this was a regular thing) and thought it’d be easier to kick the door in than to call and wake me up. Then asked me to help pay to repair the door.. She threw my iPad, court papers, beats headphones and title to my car away. New guys over every night. Drank my liquor that I kept for guests. She got fucked up every single day on sleeping pills and alcohol, by herself. Stole my clothes, she’s at least 3 sizes larger than me. One time, she lost her car and her keys in the city and couldn’t find it for like 3 weeks. Had to report her car missing. The list goes on... Edit: words
Lawyers of Reddit: What is the dumbest legal advice you've ever heard given by someone who isn't a lawyer?	'You should've just refused a breath test' to a girl who crashed her car while 5 times the legal limit. He actually was a lawyer.	The number of people who arent aware of or understand the concept of at-will employment is astounding to me. The conversation usually goes something like this: "You got fired for (insert virtually anything other than being a member of a protected class and whistleblowing)? Sounds like a lawsuit to me!!!!!!!!!!"
What jobs by their nature can turn nice people into assholes?	Cops are at the top of the list Dr learn it in second year med school, you can ask my best friend. She turned into a beeeoootcch exactly second year, she said it happened to them all. High school teachers Jail and prison guards Bouncers Tattoo artist who get a little too full of themselves. I lived with one for many years, it's not pretty. DPS In some hospitals nurses can get a bit hard from dealing with asshole patients	Being a landlord means learning that everyone except you is a filthy, disgusting urchin that lives in goddamn squalor. And no one knows even rudimentary things about how to maintain and keep up a home. EVERYONE IS DISGUSTING EXCEPT ME. Also, you will have to ruin some peoples' dreams. Oh, you bought a house because you're newly married? Well, you're two months into a 12 month lease, so, uh... That sucks.
What is the consensus of Reddit wrong on?	Cops are bad. If you have a problem with your SO you should leave them. Bernie Sanders is God. God doesn't exist.	If something displeases you about a person or your relationship with them, cut them out of your life rather than work on the situation. People are often the architects of the displeasure they experience in relationships, or at least a significant contributor to the negative situations. In addition, many relationships are worth working on even if they go through a rough patch. It's valuable to develop the skills to build strong relationships and weather the inevitable troubles along the way. Being rigid in your ways and resistant to taking responsibility for problems will leave you lonely because it's very hard to be around someone like that for extended periods.
Why do grocery stores, especially in the US, insist on making cashiers stand?	I worked at a supermarket where the cashiers had to stand, then transfered to one where they were allowed to sit. Trust me the former were so much more productive. Also standing for long periods of time becomes really easy after a while, in the case of pregnant women a chair would be fair. However for the elderly. If they are young enough to work then they should be able to stand for that long with breaks etc, they are much tougher than they look! and complain much less that the teenagers.	The reasoning I usually hear is something along the lines of is it makes cashiers look less lazy and/or more professional. source: working retail for too long
[Serious] People and officers who have had to deliver the news to someone that their spouse, child, etc., has died, what was the worst/most heartbreaking reaction you have seen?	I watched a girl I was in love with blow her brains out. She painted the walls and me. I didn't realize it at the time. When I told her dad what happened, and he realized the little grey flecks on my cheeks were his daughter's brains, he broke down in a way I didn't imagine humanly possible and it makes me feel horrible.	I was very fortunate to not have to be the one to deliver the news, but I was present when a man and his wife found out their daughter's, who had been missing for a couple weeks, body had been found. The wife was sitting in a chair and started wailing like you'd expect, but the husband just stared at the police officer that told him for a few seconds before turning around and taking a couple steps away from everyone. He had the emptiest look on his face, a real thousand yard stare. He turned back to the police officer and it almost looked like he was about to say something and then he just kind of crumpled, I don't know how else to describe it.
Dear reddit whats the weirdest thing you've been paid to do?	I normally where my hair long, got paid to shave my head AND eyebrows. Every single one of my teachers the next day thought I was a new student.	While in the 8th grade, my class was assigned to write an essay. Someone paid me 5 bucks to submit the teacher's example of an ideal essay as my own essay. I did, and I received a B grade for the essay. How the teacher didn't notice, still eludes me.
Former porn stars, how awkward is it when your children find your videos?	Not many real responses. Massive slut-shaming for women who have done it on film for whatever reason at all. Great job, Internet!	I found a drawer of porn magazines in the garage. Like raunchy early 80s cheap ones. Flip through some, chuckled.......until I came across what appeared to be my father....naked and fully erect...then banging some bitch. There was at least a fourpage spread of his nautyness. Screamed as I threw it like a bag of snakes. My husband comes running in and I look like I encountered sasquatch, point to the mag azine trying to articulate through a stutter of disbelief. He picked it up, flips though it and I see his jaw drop. He throws it back and says, "Yep, looks like your dad." So naturally I pop that bad boy into my sister's mailbox, never hear about it again....
Homeless (past or current) people of reddit: what is one item that would have really come in handy during your time on the streets?	I was homeless for close to three months and the one item I found to be the most useful was my skateboard. Makes a great pillow at night with the addition of topping material. Easy transportation. Great little side table or lap table for rolling blunts. It also provided entertainment and I assume could be used for self defense. There probably were more uses but those are the ones I remember most vividly. But I must stress that socks and shoes are super important. I would generally wear a new pair of socks every day just to insure that I would not get foot rot.	Not homeless, but socks and a cheap pair of shoes, but nothing too flashy or they'll get stolen from him.
If you could re-create the high school curriculum, what courses would you take out or add? Which ones would you make mandatory? Why?	Add in a mandatory politics class, make science optional, add mandatory gym classes, take out languages, and add basic computer classes	As a college academic advisor I work with a wide range of recently graduated high school students from all over the country. I would not necessarily add or take away a specific course from the curriculum. I would modify it a good bit. I would decrease the amount of testing that students are required to do. I would require a full year of General Health/Sex Ed, require a half year of Typing/Keyboard, a full year of general IT coding, plus Personal Finance class. I would leave the History, Math, English, and Foreign Language the way they are in general. Student's seem to be over tested instead of actually learning material. We need to teach them basics on daily life functions like how to construct an email, balance their checking account, and how to save money properly, along with basic business skills.
What’s a non-sexual fantasy of yours?	The wife deciding to take the kids to visit her mother during the first week of March Madness and I just happen to conveniently have a week of time off that needs to be used.	To own a beautiful home, not a big one though, that I can afford to furnish and decorate how I want, in a nice neighbourhood.
Who is the most overrated person in the history of mankind?	Jesus, if he existed. Previous Jewish theologians had devised the Golden Rule time and time again, and Jesus really had very few novel moral concepts... except for "worship me or I'll set you on fire," and even that was pretty common for savior cults of the time. He didn't even seem to think slavery was worth condemning. Kind of a tool, I guess.	This might sound odd, but I would have to say William Wallace can be considered overrated, not because of his deeds but because his life has been so over-embellished in fictional stories. Very little of Wallace's life was recorded except for his battles in Sterling and Falkirk as well as his capture and gruesome execution. Little is known of him besides the battles, except that he was a member of lesser Scottish nobility. Most of the biographical information that has built up Wallace's legend came from Blind Harry's poem The Wallace which was written 170 years after Wallace's execution and took its information about Wallace from oral tradition and embellished it further. This is not to say that Wallace wasn't important, but the way his life has been portrayed makes him out to be an almost mythical character.
Reddit, have you ever intentionally physically hurt someone?	1. I was sent to jail for my meth addiction, I was not in a good place. Drugs had always been a part of me and suddenly they weren't. I wasn't given the proper detox meds, I wasn't given therapy, I tried to intentionally hurt many people, including myself. 2. My brother, he's 7 years older than me and would fuck with me, playfully of course. I would rage and windmill the shit out of him trying to cause as much pain as possible. He would laugh as I became more and more infuriated I could do no damage. 3. Everyday I hustle, bitch.	A kid, standing on the sidewalk with his bike, maybe a year younger than me yelled obscenities at me while I rode past him, I yelled back 'Take it easy kid!'. Next thing I know, he stole my hat by taking it off my head, while riding past me on his shitty bicycle, while I was riding chill on my race bike. Caught up with him in no time. Kicked his bike as hard as I could. He slammed into the ground and crawled around like a basic bitch. I got my hat back and went on my merry way. Don't fucking touch my hat.
What is the weirdest supernatural experience you've had?	Talking to a Ghost who happen to be in my room, Her name was Polly, died of old age of 89. And shit I Got a lot of questions answered. Dang, I wasn't really scared but more fascinated by what I can get answers too. P.S. Apparently she didn't know that ghost can poses people, and I told her to tried it, and she did. Cool Right?	When I was kid, there was a room in the back of the house I never liked to be in. I hated how I felt when I was in there but it was set up as my toy room. One night, I decided to play in there and I would see quick shadow movement go past the windows. All of a sudden, the light outside by the door that's in the toy room turns on. I never heard the light switch come on or anything. I got so freaked out that I ran out the room. Years later, I find out that a little boy died in the house we lived in.
Redditors who were alive and can remember the 31st of December 1999 where were you? And what was it like for you?	A plane crashed into our house - luckily dad had made us get into the basement and bought loads of dried food. But the idiot ate it all because he didn't realise you had to add water. We left then to try to find a Twinkie factory. My brother was turned into an octobaby. We arrived in this town and my dad became mayor - but then he fucked up and we got chased out. Edit - I can't spell plane apparently.	I was 10 at the time and at my friends house. We went down to his basement and turned off all the breakers at exactly 12:00.00 and then heard everybody upstairs start screaming.
What are some green flags that a new relationship has a good chance to last?	If he doesn’t have a problem with her dick being bigger than his, there’s a good chance they’ll make it.	Honestly, even if that person is not perfect from day one, if they make a little effort and learn as they go, then it's a great start.
Serious. Guys of Reddit what do you wish girls would relax about?	Dear Men posting BS responses in this thread. You're all a bunch of fucking liars. Stop pretending you "don't care" about what women look like.	If we say something that has two meanings we always mean the good one. Stop searching for an insult that isn't there.
What's your most regretful "I could have fucked her/him" story?	Senior year of high school, there was a girl that I had a crush on for like a year or so. One day, while I'm out with my brother and dad, she texts me and says, "hey are you free today? I'm home alone and want to listen to The Beatles." Mind you, it's well established with everyone that I know that The Beatles are my favorite band, and I knew she wasn't *huge* into them. But I told her that I wasn't free. In retrospect, I know that could have only meant one thing.	A girl at work was very much interested in me. Always finding reasons to come talk to me, flirting all the time, making mildly suggestive remarks (nothing too inappropriate), etc. Anyway, one day she kept touching me. I wasn't in the best of moods and after a while said "What are you on ecstasy or something? Why do you keep touching me?"
Women of Reddt, why don't you ask him out?	Hey men of reddit, why can't you ask her out? How about everyone ask out people that give you boners.	I did. He laughed at me. :( EDIT: Now that I think of it, I initiated half of the relationships I've ever been in, probably due to impatience on my part and a certain social obliviousness.
Where have you been that you would never go again?	Pittsburgh, PA. It is a fucking awful city. Those were some of the worst months of my life. I am glad to be home.	Times Square, NYC, New Years Eve. Probably about 17 years ago so I hope things have changed, but back then we had to get there something like 10 hours early to get close to the center, there were no restrooms, and it was freezing cold. When the ball dropped at midnight, we were all like, "yay! <kiss kiss hug hug> now let's get the fuck out of here!"
Teachers of reddit: What is the strangest thing you have ever confiscated from a pupil?	I'm not a teacher (getoverit.jpg) but in 8th grade this kid that we knew was missing a few bolts (if ya know what I mean) came to school with his mom's crusty vibrator and slapped a few kids in the face with it. Never saw him again.	A dead parrot. I looked up in the middle of storytime and this kid was hitting his friend with a dead parrot.
What product can you not believe got popular?	Soulja Boy. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan. Me and my friends listened to him back in the myspace days as a joke, 'I got me some bapes' was fire. I was SHOCKED when I heard him on the radio, and now he's like legit.	Amber teething necklaces. Apparently amber can "sense" the pain of a teething child and when worn, leak a strong natural side-effect-free pain relieving oil into the skin, which immediately stops all pain in all parts of the body, prevents biting, prevents drooling, reduces fever, cures infection, soothes inflammation and helps teeth grow stronger. There's a mother in my baby's playgroup that sells these necklaces, for $200 a pop, $250 with a "certificate of authenticity" The other parents swear by them and buy them regulary. And by regulary, I mean the seller has actually convinced these morons that the amber has a limited supply of magic oil, and you need to repurchase new ones every 6 months. Or for only $100, she will take your old necklace and "refill" it with amber oil. Nobody else in the playgroup can understand why I don't buy one.
What did a crush do that made you immediately lose interest?	She was childish asf because she DEADASS STARTED CRYING when trump won the election Not that I’m a trump supporter I don’t really care I just thought that was childish cuz of that	Not so much a crush, but we were in the initial sentences of the conversation getting to know each other. We were describing to one another what our jobs were. He corrected me on describing my job.. stopped right there, said it wasn’t going to work out and ended the conversation..
Teachers of Reddit what was a point where you just felt bad for a kid but couldn't do anything?	Not a teacher but knew one. She once told me a story about how this kid would arrive at school late pretty much every day. When she asked him why he would always say that his mom had been out the previous night or she just didn't feel like getting up. This hit me right in the feels, what can you do in this situation?	Had a 4th grade student who did not have food at home. One of my best students. This kid would scarf down school lunch, as it was often the only meal he got. I would sometimes buy him a 2nd lunch, and started bringing in a backpack full of food to get him through the weekends. He moved out of district about 3/4 of the way through the year, so I'm not sure what has happened to him since.
A friend of mine living on minimum wage recently waited in line for an iPhone 5, yet is so destitute that her 18-month old has been fed mostly Ramen and Cheetos for the past year. When have you seen young parenting go horribly, horribly wrong?	I go into the ER lobby and call in a 4 year old kid. Mom starts walking towards me, the boy is behing her crying his eyes out. It was not a painful cry or a scared kind of cry, it was a mad type of cry. As we were going into the office, I asked about that. Her reply was that, "he's just mad because he did not want to go to the hospital so I told him I was taking him to Chuck-E-Cheese."	Am am a long time pediatric ER nurse. I was assessing a baby that the mother brought in with a complaint of troube breathing. While I was checking him out, I caught a wiff of bug spray. I asked mom about it. She told me that she saw a bug crawl in his mouth so she gave it a squirt of Raid. I was dumbfounded. Speechless. I just looked at her with my WTF face. She told me not to worry, it was only a little bit. That woman was around 16. TLDR: Mom sprayed Raid into her baby's mouth.
What is a goal that you've reached only to say "meh"?	I don't think anyone works their ass off and think "meh". At the very least they are proud of having worked their ass off.	I like to make things. I built a steam engine (model) from scratch. I bought a lathe and learned how to use it. Made a smelter to cast parts. Bought and learned how to use a mill. Spent 100+ hours building the engine. got it running, polished and painted. Then I was like, well that sucked.
Men of reddit, what is something that women think turns men on, but in reality does nothing for you?	Like we give a fuck. Why is it so important we be perfect sexual beings? Half the answers here complain about behaviors women display because of internalized oppression. We baby talk because we are constantly told we are more attractive at younger ages. We act dumb because we are told not to be smarter than men. It's not men's fault but it's not ours either. This question perpetuates the idea that everything a woman does should meet the expectations of men and I'm fucking done with it. A lot of people are.	When a woman plays 'hard to get,' I play a game called 'looking elsewhere.' Seriously, that hard to get bullshit is a massive turnoff.
What's one thing you hate about modern society?	PC culture and the enforcement of tolerance. I shouldn't have to tolerate a primitive and degenerate culture that is out to destroy my homeland.	When I watch the news on TV and they say, "let's see what the people on twitter are saying". Who the fuck cares?
My bus driver intentionally skipped my stop because a man in a wheelchair was waiting there and he didn't want to let him on. What instances of terrible/immoral customer service have you witnessed?	Once, they were some stupid football game going on (1998 world cup, we won) and the bus driver wanted to go home. I still had to make it to my hostel in a city I didn't know. He didn't seem to understand he has to finish is circuit, but make it anyway. Not the same as your story, but it's my experience of a bus driver trying not to make the stop.	I was charged twice at a restaurant last month, and after a few times calling and leaving my name and information, my dad went in for me (I didn't have time to go with). Anyway, they said, "Well, why should we believe you?" *My bank statement is right there..* EDIT: We did end up getting the money back.
What's your 'worst neighbor ever' story?	oh dear god...I live in an apartment and next us is like 8 black people, including about like 3 kids, and when I was going downstairs (cause I live in the 3rd floor) I saw the fire extinguisher in front of our neighbors door and near the end of the hallway, I noticed some broken glass and just yesterday, I notice a paper that's says something like "we have replaced a lot of the fire extinguishers cause they keep getting missing, if you have noticed anything suspicious, please call *numbers*" and I'm too lazy to report about this...so yeah	My friends upstairs neighbor has a dog, he never takes for a walk or out for a poop. So the dog just shits on the balcony and when it dries he shovles off the balcony onto the cars below. Then throws water on it to clean it up and the shit water drips down onto her balcony. She has called the landlord, the city, the maintenance company. No one will do anything about it. We have shouted at him while doing it and he stops for a minute but continues when we are gone. If you knock on his door, he won't answer.
What is something you did that you got 0 credit for?	Birthing my #2 son. I was trying for a birth in a midwifery center, but my water trickled and I ended up forced to the hospital. The staff tried to make me stay in bed from early labor on, and continually got in my way as I was walking through the pains...it helps so much. My main wish was to have them leave me alone so I could have my baby. I got a bit shirty with them. I did it all with no meds, and my husband and I caught our baby, got him to breathe and my husband cut the cord. Then some asshole nurse announced, "We have a boy!!" and I thought, "We??!! What is this 'we' shit?"	I live in a heavily populated downtown area near a university with 30,000 students, naturally there is a lot of litter. I regularly take walks with a garbage bag and pick up every piece of trash I see. It's an exercise in futility, everyday there is new garbage on the streets, but I care about my community so I try anyway. The only person that knows this is my roommate and the strangers that give me puzzled looks when they see what I'm doing.
What's the worst case of the butterfly effect that ever happened?	World War 2 wouldn't have happened were it not for a fieldmouse 2 million years ago eating one seed instead of the one adjacent to it.	If the Buffalo Bills had scored a touchdown in 1970, the Kardashians would had never became famous The Buffalo Bills barely lost a game in 1970 by missing on a bad pass for a touchdown. That loss allowed them to get the first pick in the draft, O.J. Simpson. OJ stays in Buffalo for awhile, meets his wife, then allegedly kills her. Then hiring Kardashians father to be his lawyer. They win the case, making the Kardashians somewhat famous. Then Kim drops the sex tape, becomes famous.
Dear Reddit: If you had 6 months of free time what will you do to improve yourself?	That depends on what "free time" means. I simply don't have a job? I find one. I have savings or a basic wage that would cover my usual bills (but not much else)? I'd work on my side project harder and try to get it to a main job. I have any and all expenses paid, no matter what? I would immediately buy a storefront and tons of toys and games to sell, so I can keep growing after the 6 months is over.	I recently had about 8 months of free time between my current job and my last job. When it started I was all like "Oh yeah, I'll have plenty of time to go to the gym and actually get decent at cooking, maybe get some certifications I've been putting off." Nope. I basically spent 24/7 of those 8 months sitting on my ass playing video games. And it was awesome. If I could go back and do it again, I wouldn't change a thing.
What was the biggest "fuck you" in history?	I'd say the biggest one is rather recent - and it's from the American people. A dedicated, life-long politician had her political legacy thrown into the toilet by getting beaten for President by a 'pussy-grabbing', racist, Birther.	Ferruccio Lamborghini was a rich man owning his company that built tractors, he talked to Ferrari about the imperfections of his car and how to improve them and they basically laughed at a young tractor mechanic trying to tell them about sport cars, so he decided to start making luxury sport cars to compete with Ferrari and thus, the rivalry was born. So i'd say the middle finger of this guy to Ferrari was pretty noticeable.
Can we guess the country you live in, based on a description of your daily routine?	Wake up, soak in the sweet, sweet freedom, and then give thanks that I live in the greatest country in the entire world.	Wake up, make tea with the teabag my mom used, go to the toilet to take a morning dump while looking at the calendar to see who's birthday is coming up, get on my bicycle to work in the rain, eat 4 slices of brown bread with cheese during lunch, finish work and ride my bicycle back home in the rain, arrive home, eat my cooked vegetables with cooked potatoes, go to a birthday and congratulate everyone with the person's birthday, sit in the birthday circle, eat cheese and saugage with mustard, talk about the weather, go home and sleep.
How do you cope with deep-set existential dread and the realization that everything in your life is ultimately meaningless and temporary?	As you grow older and out of your edgy teenage years, you'll realize that it is possible to enjoy the short time we have.	Even if nothing about your human experience is ever recorded or considered by any future people, it is still *your* human experience. Your lifespan may be short with respect to that of the cosmos, but it's a long time for any one person to live through. So, you should try to make the most of it. Humans are amazing creatures that are capable of so much. Learn things, push your body to its potential, let others enrich your life, and work towards a better future for yourself and those you care about.
What was the nsfw accident that happened at your school?	Some slut got pregnant her senior year. I don’t say slut in a bad way, like she actually was. She did keep the baby though, her baby daddy was nowhere to be found however.	Some kid pooped his pants and put them inside the ceiling. It took weeks to figure out where the smell came from.
Should I give this girl a job?	I work at Chick-Fil-A and we have a customer like that. He works at some hair salon in the mall and he is always dressed up like a girl. None of the people I've ever seen interact with him really seem to care. Some people might, sure, but I think the majority of people really just don't care.	You know, my local vet employs a MtF trans person who doesn't look even remotely convincing as a woman. I live in a very republican area of a very republican Southern State. If people here can accept it, people anywhere can accept it. Please, give her the job. Let me put this another way. Imagine you are working at a retail store in the south just after the end of segregation. Would you decide not to hire a black person for fear that some customers may not like it? I very much hope that you wouldn't think like that. Be the guy who champions the downtrodden, not the guy who caves in to the hypothetical bigoted sensibilities of others and deprives a deserving human being of gainful employment.
What city has the worst design flaws and why?	Montreal...at least as a tourist. They built this city around a freakin' mountain. When you visit, you feel compelled to climb the damn thing only to get to the top to watch some pretentious French couple drinking champagne from plastic flutes. Luckily, on the backside of the trail, there is a nice little rock that you can step onto to shake your first at the whole city.	Dubai worst city planning in history. No left turns. You can be sitting in front of your destination its a 2 minute walk. But you are on the wrong side of the road and it can be up to 25 minutes away. And god forbid you make a wrong turn, it'll ruin your entire day. PLUS, constant road construction make actually navigating the city a nightmare. It is as if they plan nothing, arbitrarily blocking off entire roads just because, and closing 1 exit completely changes the traffic patterns and creates huge jams unnecessarily.
What are you sick of hearing people complain about?	* Student loans * Can't find a job with useless college degree * Can't get laid * Climate change * Minimum wage * Tipping * Conservatives * Liberals * The "wage gap" and/or the extreme wealth of a tiny minority of society * That churches pay no taxes * That healthcare isn't "free" * Influence of religion on the culture	"Restaurant food is expensive" You aren't meant to eat there every day, it's meant as a treat, learn to fucking cook.
So.. Did anything at all happen to the Judge that beat his daughter for using the computer?	"she posted the video after he told her he would no longer support her financially and was taking away her Mercedes-Benz because the piano prodigy had dropped out of college... " I'm capable of making the inferences. I'll bet she regrets releasing the video.	He will not be prosecuted but is under judicial review. Last I heard they are trying to get him off the bench while the investigation was underway. Also there was no evidence it was happening with the youngest daughter.
I can't stand when people glorify drinking and the bad decisions that follow. What other things do you hate that people glorify?	Fucking people they hate or have no respect for. I know women do it, but I think even when they do, they at least imagine they like the dude and the dude likes them. I have had too many acquantances describe a girl they've slept with as a "pig". I find it incomprehensible. I mean... if you're going with animal play and she wants to play the dirty little piggy, that's a completely different thing and cute in it's own way. But he absolute disdain I've heard in a guy's voice when he says "Man, she was a fucking *pig*." I just don't get it. You fucked her. So what does that say about you? There you go, feminazis, Giegerwasright criticizing a too common male behavior.	War. I mean sure the games are great, but 90% of my school thinks cod = exactly same as war and that war is fun.
Have you ever delivered a burn so good that even the person it was supposed to offend was impressed?	There was a girl I really hated at my highschool. She was always saying mean things to people and playing them off as jokes. We were boarding a bus for a long school trip and the bus reeked of old fish. There she was, sitting in with her group of cronies. I couldn't help myself. "It reeks in here. Jesus girl, close your legs!" All her friends laughed.	8th grade history class. My mostly bald teacher was doing a presentation and asked the class what was missing from a map he had shown. I blurted out "your hair line" He walked over, using his hand he pulled my hair back to make me look bald on top and said "this is what bleed-black will look like at your ten year class reunion." Everyone laughed and I was a little embarrased. Fast forward 14 years.. ten year class reunion. There were quite a few middle school and high school teachers there giving little speeches and telling memories of our class. My old 8th grade history teacher came to the mic and said "raise your hand if you were in my class with bleed-black".. about 25-30 raised their hands.. "anyone notice anything missing from Mr. Blacks hairline?".. everyone died laughing including myself.. my half bald self...
What's your best 'YOU HAD ONE JOB' story?	My one and only job: I worked at a chicken factory. I was doing odd jobs everyday. One day I would be running around the barn catching chickens and hooking them up to the zip line. Other times, I was cutting the cellulite (which is green) off the chicken thighs. Other times, I was dumping barrels of ice into hole for 8+ hours. I have been self-employed ever since.	Putting Christmas lights on the roof of my house, my sister's supposed to be holding the ladder steady... For some reason she just wandered off... I fell 12 feet when the ladder slipped. Luckily I landed in some bushes, and no bones were broken.
What popular food do you hate?	Pizza. And unlike another comment, I actually can't stand it. Whenever I've tried to eat it, it's been a fight just to swallow it because I just start gagging immediately.	Pumpkins and pumpkin spice anything. I don't think there are any actual pumpkins in pumpkin spice mix but I happen to hate both. So so much. Someone asked me to try a PSL and I thought why the hell not and I wanted to die.
Students of Reddit, asking as a teacher: How are you feeling about going back to school? What would you want to make sure your teachers know as we’re trying to make plans for you?	I absolutely want to go back to school, but before that, I want to ask every single teacher here: Why do you have to do everything on your own? It's not as if you are the most superior race on the planet, or the most intelligent. You should at least ask us about our opinion on what will be used on us, like online classes. Why Zoom? Why Microsoft Teams? Give me one good reason we students could not be able to find something better and easier to handle.	India. Online classes started last Monday. 9 hours of lectures a day, for 6 days a week. I think the most important thing in your plans should be to realise that just because we're at home, we're not okay with sitting in front of a screen for so long. I'd prefer uploaded videos rather than live meetings, unless it's a technical subject.
[Serious] Doctors of Reddit, what are the red flags that people shoud look out for in order to avoid an incompetent or "bad" doctor?	If a doctor is worried about offending you, they do not have your best health interests in mind. For example, a doctor that supports HAES, etc.	For the people complaining about doctors using computers in the examining room, you should know that one part of the ACA ( Obamacare) mandated Electronic Medical Records. They do that instead of ( and sometimes in addition to) having the old fashioned paper chart.
Gun Silencers in movies...what are some other things hollywood gets totally wrong?	Units and Measures: Lightyears used as time unit. It's an unit of distance, not time - it means the distance that the light travels within one year - approx. 9.5 trillion kilometres. Parsecs (Star Wars IV - A new Hope): A Parsec (parallaxe second) is also an unit of distance. A parsec is the distance from the Sun to an astronomical object which has a parallax angle of one arcsecond. or approx. 3.26 Lightyears GET IT HOLLYWOOD?	Punches in fist fights. The first time I punched someone I was disappointed at both how quiet it was and how much it hurt.
(Serious) Reddit, what's the worst pain you've ever experienced?	Physical pain. I was around 8 or 9 years old when it happened. Basically, I was using a chair to step down from someplace high off the ground and lost my balance while doing it. While this happened, I split my legs and my vagina landed right on the top rail of the chair and then I just dropped dead on the ground. It fucking hurt. I spent an hour crying because youknowwhat was swollen and the whole day just clutching my crotch. Fml.	Lаnded on a jagged pool tile after I ѕlipped jumping in. 4 1/2'' long gash іn my stomach allowed me to see mу own intestines; they had to give mе a shot *inside* the wound, 3 nurѕes had a very hard time holding dоwn 8 year old me.
If there was a "Reddit Gold" counterpart called "Reddit Shit" to give to annoying Redditors, what features would make you buy it?	I would run out of money if I gave it to every Breitbart article I saw come across political subreddits.	Shit flair that can't be removed. All posts cannot start off upvoted by yourself (post at 0 upvotes initially). All uppercase lettering forced to lowercase. Occasional period removed or replaced with semicolon. "Lol" added to end of post.
What’s the dumbest purchase you’ve ever made?	A 3ds and refixing a broken a ps3. Man those were a waste. Ever since that I prefer PCs or laptops to be more precise.	Almost all of the clothes I've bought online ended up just sitting in the closet, due to false advertising or overall shitty quality
Your weirdest experience during puberty?	Being disgusted by male changes and wishing I could develop as female instead. Took a few years before I realized I was trans.	Freshman year my nipples would lactate a tiny bit if I squeezed them really hard. Which is odd because I am a male. Years later even after I switched schools sophomore year kids from my freshman year would ask about my nipples.
Straight men of reddit, what's the attraction of anal sex with a woman?	As Jim Jeffries puts it: "Women, the reason men like fucking you in the ass is...because we know you fucking hate it."	It's sort of like NASA and the moon. A long time ago they looked at that beautiful orb hanging in the night sky and thought "We are not supposed to be there. It will be costly. It will be dangerous. Some people might say it's not supposed to happen." But they did it anyway. And that's why we do it in the pooper.
Gay People Of Reddit: What are things that you don't have to explain to each other, since you're dating the same gender?	Lesbian here. My wife and I understand the subtleties of the patriarchy. It's nice to come home and tell my partner about something that was said or done on the job and not have to then explain the misogyny behind it and why it was offensive. The shared journey and validation helps us navigate this crazy planet. (Not saying that men can't understand it, but it's nice to be with someone who can truly empathize.)	Person A: Wanna have sex? Person B:Hmm, not right now. Person A: Okay, I'm gonna go jack off. Person B: Enjoy! No muss, no fuss.
What do you have an irrational hatred for?	I have an extreme irrational hatred for a classmate of mine. Whenever she opens her mouth I just get so annoyed I almost always tell her to stop, even when she says the smallest thing. My friends had pointed it out and I'm aware but yeah, I don't know why I hate her so much.	People who still have text message signatures. You want anything from the store? Snickers would be great! ~Live like u were dying!!~ .Donna
What's a random fact about your dad?	He was never around for my life. I can say I have no dad other than some guy pregnant my mom.	Dad worked a "secret" second job in a wood mill (after working his regular 8-hour day of manual labor) in order to save up enough money to take Mom on her "dream trip" to Europe for their 25th Wedding Anniversary. (Mom thought he was out with his friends playing pool - or whatever - and had zero idea he was busting his rump working so many hours.) She had silently accepted the likelihood that the trip would never happen because they simply couldn't afford it. But he was determined to show his love and make her dream a reality - and he did! Bless him.
What's the biggest realization you had from a context of a conversation where you had to act normal to protect someone/yourself?	Basically when did you lie to someone because you think too low of them to tell them the truth like an equal member of society.	I was at a bar once minding my own business when a girl came up to me and started acting like she knew me. I looked at her and she gave me a look like she wanted help so I played along and acted like I knew her as well. Later found out she was with someone there who was beginning to get creepy. Turned out to be a cool girl and she bought my drinks for helping her out, even walked her to her car in case dude stuck around.
Old people of reddit, what were old people like when you were kids?	They had balls and didn't get tribbed by every tiny fucking 'microaggression' and if you didn't like a country's people, you wouldn't talk on social media, you would just wage war	They were a lot older than we are now. Seriously -- I remember my grandma with gray hair, wearing flowered house dresses, an apron, and ortho shoes. She walked bent over, really slowly. All grandmas did. It's just what "old people" were like. I did the math not long ago and figured out that at the time I remember her from, she was (at most) 65.
Who was your worst teacher and Why?	I live in Australia and my teacher was African. He was mean to the whites and nice to the blacks.	Had a 3rd grade teacher rip up my math work in front of me that I stayed in during recess to complete.
Starting this year, Belgium has mandatory classes where you learn things you need to know when functioning in a society (things like taxes, savings, finding a job...). This is given at around the age of 12. What do you think about this, and should other countries do this too?	The reason they don’t do this is because they want to keep us poor. Who’s going to work the 9-5/6 jobs that are for the most part medial? If we taught people how to make money in school, people would be doing their own thing and not contributing as much to big corporations seeing as though they’d know how to make the money themselves. It’s sad, and disheartening but this is the unfortunate truth.	It's the same as sex ed, you have to teach kids and teens to avoid misconceptions that will only be learnt after having serious consequences (if ever). I really hope media literacy is included in these classes.
What's the craziest sob story someone's ever told you that turned out to be totally fake?	My imaginary friend Azazel told me that he suffered in hell for nearly an eternity, saw his friends burn alive, and finally crawled out and was begging for mercy when he spotted my vulnerable young soul walking about, soon to befriend me.	Full disclosure - I used to sell printer cartridges. I had a woman enter my shop and immediately launch into tears and a long winded story about how her brother had died in brazil and she spent the last of her money buying a plane ticket to his funeral that she couldn't print because she was out of ink. I replied offerend my condolances and said that while I couldn't give her free printer cartridge, i was willing to bend policy and allow her access to one of my computers for a few minutes to print (free of charge) and documents she needed. She accused me of having the "spirit of the devil in me" because I was unwilling to help her in her time of need. Crazy bitch spat on my window as she left.
Fast Food Workers of Reddit: What is your most hated menu item?	My brother works at an ice cream parlor. Don’t order a banana split. Don’t order 4 large bananas splits. And then not tip. You suck if you do that.	Panda Express: grilled teriyaki chicken. Not that it's bad regularly. But a new batch of teriyaki chicken takes almost 20 min to finish. Where as orange chicken takes 5-8 min to finish. Most days we depend on predicting how many customers are going to order it in the next 20 minutes, so when a huge crowd comes in that only wants teriyaki chicken, it can effectively shut us down.
[Serious] People who aren't depressed, how do you enjoy life?	people who arent depressed have good lives, they have money friends, and people dont really put them down...There is no difference in stuff they enjoy. they have just had more support.	Always trying new things. Simple stuff, like discovering new bands and listening to different music genres, or going for a walk in a part of town you've never really been to. Also, I feel like maintaining hobbies is a big part of it. As an example, this year I took up photography and leatherworking. I'm good at neither, but it gives me something to do and try to get better at, which keeps me from getting swallowed by all the other shit going on in my life.
What's the creepiest or most unexplainable paranormal thing that's happened to you?	I woke up one night with the worst stomach pain I've ever had. I jammed for the toilet of course. After a couple of minutes of desperately trying to poop, all of a sudden I got the chills and shakes and all my limbs started going numb. It was probably some physiological issue, but it also could have been demons. I will never know for sure.	When I was a kid I used to sit on the counter and watch my mom cook. She had this birth mark on her arm that I was always pointing out. She told me it was her birth mark and I had asked if I had one. She said that she looked all over me, but I didn't have one. I was jealous and somewhat sad I didn't have one... I thought they made people special. One morning she was waking me up for school and she screamed. Her birth mark was gone, and it had appeared on me, in the same place, and the exact same shape. The only people that know about it is my mom, dad, and me. I ask my dad about it occasionally and he still to this day says "that was the weirdest shit I've ever seen in my entire life".
Americans living abroad, what is something you find weird/unusual in the country you're living in?	I find it more normal. I’m originally Canadian. Lived in the US for a few years and acquired citizenship. Then I promptly moved back home to Canada. It’s better here than in the US. It’s such a backwards country south of the boarder.	When I lived in Japan, it was the trucks driving around the neighborhood in the morning with people talking over loudspeakers (alternated with music iirc). Like, it's the weekend, I'm trying to sleep here. I've been told it's a form of political advertising, not sure if that's true or not. Oh, and a block of apartment buildings and stores with a field of (corn I think) growing in the next lot. Kinda cool, but definitely different.
Homeowners, what's the best purchase you've made for your home?	I have owned a home since 2002. Some of the things I have added to my home over the years. New roof, windows and sliding glass doors, all appliances, decks,fence and a hot tub. **hot tub** 10 person Coleman hot tub with waterfalls and a built in cooler. I had some outside speakers put over it. It sits on a little deck and is under my main deck. The tub is about 75% private. It has been the scene of some great late night naked parties with my wife and a couple of her friends. We use it about 4 times a week all year round.	Ceiling fan(s) - circulates air throughout the house providing cool air during the summer and saves a ton on AC. Homes that don't have circulating air tend to make me sleepy.
What scene in a children's movie was WAY too intense and traumatized the hell out of you when you were little?	TIL learned I was a fucked up child. None of this shit (age relevant) bothered. Alien when I was 8 yea that scared me so bad I had a fever that wouldn't go away till I watched Aliens and was sure it was dead. The rest of this meh. Pussies.	I only watched Fox and the Hound once. I don't know if it was the part where the lady had to leave the fox in the woods, or what, because it's been a while. Either way, that shit tore me up when I was 4 or 5.
What is the most shitty thing about becoming an adult?	When I was young I was able to smuggle drugs, get caught and still end up at a new and nice family. Now I'll end up in prison. This stinks.	I think there are two things: 1.) The sharp, jarring dose of reality that hits you when someone you are close to dies is awful, but so is the time days, weeks, or months later when you forget that they're dead and want to call them or visit with them and remember that they're dead. It's like they've died all over again. 2.) Having to make responsible choices and put all your obligations before your fun ALL. THE. TIME.
What simple thing do most people just not understand or get?	That life has no meaning. If everybody understood that than nobody would even make the effort to make war. Everyone would be focussed on being as happy as possible.	Disagreeing on a topic doesn't automatically make the other person evil. You're perfectly capable of having a discussion without hurt feelings.
Who's the toughest motherfucker you know?	My cousin would have to be the toughest guy I know. He told me one his stories where he was trying to enter a club of some sort and the bouncer was giving him problems. He told me the conversation went a little like this. Bouncer: Welcome to the Salty Spittoon. How tough are ya? Cousin: How tough am I? How tough am I?! I had a bowl of nails for breakfast this morning! Bouncer: Yeah, so? Cousin: Without any milk. Bouncer: Uh, right this way, sorry to keep you waiting. I felt nothing but respect and fear towards him after he told me about that incident.	My Grandpa, on Monday he fell, smashed his head on a rock, and broke a piece of his skull the size of a cork out of his head. He blacked out for a minute, then got up ,put his skull fragment in a sandwich bag,put a band aid on the hole in his head, and went about his business.
Whats an embarrassingly obvious fact you learned recently?	Its called " the mall " because you don't just go into one store, you go to... " them all "	The reason doctors tell you to "turn your head" and cough is simply so you don't cough on them. For years I thought there was some kind of connection between the neck muscles and the taint. BONUS: When I asked a friend if she knew the reason she said "Because they don't want you looking at them?"
Fast-food employees: is there anything on your menu that you would NOT recommend people eat?	I used to work at a Coldstone. Almost everything there is way too high in fat and sugar to be good for you, but very few things are actually gross. I don't recommend the yogurt-covered pretzels, though.	move theater employee here. basically, everything that's not popcorn. that's the only thing that we make fresh every day, and still the seeds could be months old. "gourmet" foods (hot dogs, pretzels, pizza, etc.) come frozen and are warmed up in our giant microwave. if they're not sold, they go back in the freezer. repeat. for days. months. until the day that you're the lucky person eating an expensive, 365 day old pretzel. congrats
Teachers of Reddit, have you ever had a crush on a student, and if so how did you feel about yourself?	Not a teacher, but I had a crush on my teacher once. Go on, ask me what it was like Edit: it was awesome, she bent over towards me and I swear I saw a Pokemon pendant in her cleavage, aah miss Middleton even at 70 she still had it goin on	I used to teach entry level programming at an art school to undergrads and later at the graduate level. It happened *all the fucking time* but I never felt bad about it, cuz they were adults and I was the same age. Obviously, I couldn't act on anything as a matter of policy, and I certainly didn't let it affect my grading, but goddamn it was difficult, especially with the two instances where I could tell it was mutual. Or maybe it wasn't and they just wanted better grades I don't know. They both got Cs regardless. Edit: I GET IT. "D" JOKES.
Your partner is mad at you. What are your tricks to calm them down?	I tell her you're just like your mother, calm down its no big deal, and you're being crazy. They always work.	One time, she was angry at me, quite unjustly. When I got home, I didn't go inside - I opened the door just enough to toss a box of chocolates into the living room, and shut it again. Like I was feeding a tiger. She laughed; it actually rebooted the mood
Once while delivering a pizza, I called the police to report a case of child abuse/neglect on a customer. I have no idea how it turned out and it drives me nuts! What are some of your stories without endings?	One time, I took a dump and flushed it, and never saw it again. I'll miss you, Trudy "the turd" Peckham.	My Dad was driving home from work and saw an accident on the side of the road. He pulled over to help and saw a middle-aged man FREAKING out, pacing back and forth, saying things like "What am I going to do? What happens now?" etc... Dad notices a little boy, laying on the ground, barely alive. Dad takes off his shirt to try and stop the bleeding while trying to calm the man down. Tells the man that his son doesn't need to see him like this. Little boy dies in my Dad's arms. Police show up and ask my Dad a few questions. They take the man away in cuffs and my Dad heads home in tears.
If your job had an Order 66....what would you have to do?	Marine corps, hopefully kill all the politicians so we can start from scratch. Hopefully NOT so I accidentally help start a brutal dictatorship.	I work in a room that has a "kill switch". It's a button, that when pressed, will shut the system for the entire building down. It's never been pressed where I work but at least once a year we get a company wide email explaining the procedures for pressing the button. It's usually pressed accidentally due to ignorance but I know at least one time it was pressed by someone who quit, on their way out.
Have you ever hit on the cute cashier? How did it go?	Cute cashier girl keeps making mistakes. Ringing things up twice. Ect. Cashier: "im sorry about that this is only my second day" Me: "hey, no problem. Its uhh... Kinda cute." Cashier: "really?" She blushes. Dude behind me:" your both cute. Want a threesome?" What the fuck is wrong with you dude? Easily the weirdest cock block I've ever experienced.	I told her I liked her dreads and that I used to have them in college. She asked why I cut them off. I told her because I had to get a real job. "Well this is my real job" I don't go to that Whole Foods any more
What quote is always taken out of context?	"blood is thicker than water." the whole phrase is actually "the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb" and means that friendships/voluntary partnerships are **more** valuable than family. basically the opposite of how we use it.	"Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing" - Vince Lombardi He later said in life that he regretted that being one of his most remembered quotes. *“I wish to hell I’d never said the damned thing,” Lombardi once told a reporter. “I meant the effort… I meant having a goal… I sure as hell didn’t mean for people to crush human values and morality.”*
Americans of Reddit....which US state do you think has contributed least and wouldnt be missed if it fell into a huge sink-hole overnight?	South Carolina has been nothing but trouble. They were key instigators of the Civil War and have contributed nothing but a string if embarrassing politicians ever since.	Just as a heads up to Americans, Canada may have some interest in some of your northern states. Just let us know which one you don't want. Edit: we're still deliberating on which state we will be accepting and plan on deciding in the next 24 hours. Please continue to provide evidence that you belong in Canada.
What's the most awkward thing you've ever had to explain to your significant other?	I had to explain to my husband about getting a crush and consequently falling in love on another guy. (We haven't done anything about this and are adult enough to not jump into things AND I still love and enjoy my husband deeply). This is several years into our marriage.... strangely enough he's okay with it. And if I still feel like this in a while he's even willing to try a poly-amorous situation if need be. He found out that this turns him on.	There's a lot, but I once had to finally tell my husband that his breath smelled awful. It was a daily thing, and he doesn't smoke or anything, and he brushes twice a day as recommended. It was so hard for me. I said "honey, I'm saying this, because i love you, and there may be a problem, this isn't normal, you didn't always have halitosis". Turns out, he had an abscess, and was also diagnosed with oral cancer at age 25. I'm glad I got the nerve to just say it.
what law or rule now exists because of you?	Apparently a couple of weeks after I quit my last job they hung up "no smoking" signs at all of my smoke spots because I was too lazy to pick up my butts. I still feel kinda bad about fucking it up for everyone after I already peaced, but oh well	So my school was having a "cake auction" for a charity event. People would team up and spend $100-$1500 on a cake. My friend and I iced a cereal box to look like a perfect chocolate cake. There is a rule that cake has to be cake after the dean of student services bought the cake for his family.
What is something cliche that happens in movies that has happened to you in real life?	I was at the RenFair with my ex fiance about 2 years ago. There representative of the lollipop guild that challenged me to a duel for M'ladies favor. foam swords n'shit, so like the majestic Zoro i am i side stepped then he tripped i looked around and walked away....	a little set-up before the cliche: i'd just gotten coffee from wawa and was crossing the street at a crosswalk, on my bike. i didn't have a cupholder, so i was holding this coffee in one hand while steering with the other. midway through the crosswalk, i gripped the cup a little too tightly and the lid popped off, spilling coffee all over me. and now here's the movie cliche: two attractive girls pull up to the crosswalk in a cherry red convertible. they honk the horn twice and, *in unison,* they say, "Nice job, LOSER!!!" and then zoom away i felt like i was in the beginning of a coming-of-age movie, when they're establishing just how lame this guy is.
What is the funniest thing you've heard someone say in public?	"I don't celebrate Halloween because it's the day of the devil" The reason it was funny is because she didn't mean for it to be	Parents are dropping off their 4-5 (?) year old at school. His mom says "Love you! Have a good day!". Kid says "Bye fatass!". You should have seen the look on the dad's face because that's exactly who he got it from.
What's your "this isn't what it looks like" moment?	I answered this before. My mom walked in on me scratching my pubes while I was lying on my bed. The up and down movements of my hand inside my pants while I was scratching and the sheer pleasure on my face might have led her to believe that I was touching myself.	I was watching the blackfish documentary on Netflix late one night in only underwear because I was going to go to sleep. It got to the part where they talk about how valuable and expensive whale sperm is and it shows multiple people ejaculating a killer whale. It was at that very moment my mom came downstairs looked at the screen and without a single word just walked back up the stairs shaking her head.... I've never seen a more disappointing look in my life.
Which fictional character deserved better than they got?	Jesus Edit: dear Christ I know he was a real person. I was making a joke. To quote Jim Jeffries “these are things that I think are funny, not things I actually think”	Jesse Pinkman No one knows what happened to him,but he was becoming a genuinely good person towards the end and he was abused from beginning to end. I felt so bad for him once it was all said and done. I hope he found happiness once he got away... edit:spelling
We've all heard the saying: "No questions is stupid". But really, what are some of the most stupid questions you've been asked?	I smoke and there's nowhere to hide from the elements at work so I come in with irrefutable proof of whatever weather we're experiencing all over myself (rain/snow) and without fail someone will ask me "is it raining" even though I'm soaked, or "is it snowing" even though I'm covered from head to toe in snow, including snow being stuck to my boots.	In 8th grade, a kid in social studies class asked if Abraham Lincoln was still alive. Another kid responded by saying no, but he was the oldest person in the world at the time of his death. I'm not sure which is worse.
Great moments in hookup history: What is your best hookup story?	My best hookup had to be summer of 2003 in Paris. I had been traveling all day from London with a group of forty friends all celebrating our graduation from high school and was pretty tired. My friends and I were too lazy to explore the city, but still had some energy to burn off, so we went back up to our hotel room and hooked up our game boys to play zelda, link to the past, on co-op. It was so much fun, I loved chucking my friend across rivers to grab keys and stuff.	My step cousin stayed with us last year at my dads house... I came home drunk one night and passed out around 2 in the morning, woke up to a gorgeous Irish girl standing at the doorway saying "everybody else is asleep I didn't think you'd mind of i woke you up"...in a drunken haze I sat up, she came and sat on my single bed...and I knew what was up to say the least. It was oddly erotic considering she's my cousin through marriage and both my parents and hers were upstairs. Nobody caught us, but god Damn if it wasn't the best thing to wake up drunk to!
When people say, "They died peacefully in their sleep", how do they know the person didn't wake up suddenly, terrified, in pain, with demons dragging them to hell?	Because there are no such things as demons or a mythical place of torment where you are inflicted infinite pain for a finite life where you made human mistakes.	Well, people die in their sleep all the time, and many times somebody is there when it happens, I'd think they might notice the person waking up terrified (even if the demons and hell were not visible). How they know it's peaceful, well, I suppose they don't, but if it were traumatic, you'd think there'd be signs, people die when hooked up to monitors that would should *something* suggesting distress right before death.
Tour guides of Reddit, who was the most ignorant person/group of people you had to work with?	I was a tour guide for a zoo I used to work for there was one tour I was giving where I noticed a mother and father not paying attention to their child I would notice the toddler wandering off a lot so I would remind the parents almost constantly that they need to watch their child. So we get to the gorilla exhibit I look up and sure enough there's the kid getting mauled by our gorilla.	Former tour guide at an ice cream factory here. After explaining to a group how we make ice cream I had a woman raise her hand and asked why we had to use milk and cream. Had another lady who didn't understand that ice cream, served at different temperatures, had different consistencies (soft serve v. hard ice cream). Another time a woman wanted to get more tickets for the rest of her family after she arleady had bought her own. Told I needed $12 for the three additional tickets ($4 a piece). Told me I was trying to scam her of more money. Had to take receipt paper and show her the math that $4 x 3 = $12. Still didn't understand and they proceeded to leave. I have a lot more but working there made me realize how ignorant some people really are.
Which brand has lost you as a customer ?	Chick-fil-a They didn’t exist where I grew up so I was first introduced to it in college and it was great. I loved it. Then I found out that profits were being donated to groups that wanted to take civil liberties away from innocent people and I stopped eating it. I still get cravings when I pass it but I refuse to help hurt people for their sexuality. Edit: so I tried sorting by controversial and this comment came up first... damn guys, I didn’t realize my eating at chick-fil-a meant so much to you. I’m honored.	Ticketmaster ... .00034 seconds after tickets go on sale, SOLD OUT for all but cosmically afar seats but their subsidiary Stubhub has them for 400% more but you need to pay an oxygen fee, electricity fee, left turning fee, reach around fee before the fee to disclose fees ... at least 50 shows that I’ve declined to go when I see that loathsome logo... never ever EVER going to pay them a dime .. probably a fee for that too... Edit: Thank you gold sender... no fee on that and appreciated! Edit note: ok... Stubhub isn’t a subsidiary of Ticketscamster - but they’re a parasitic part of the problem of bogarting all the prime tickets before gen public.
What's the creepiest non-paranormal thing that's happened to you?	I have an old CRT TV and when you turn it off you can see some "blotches" occassionally. Anyways one time i turned it off to see a clear, high resolution image of a smiling child. I freaked and covered the TV with a blanket. A while later i took it off and turned on the TV, and the face wad gone. The next day i see the face i saw again in the newspaper, turns out a child died outside our house the day before. To this day i am left visibly shaken even writing this	I was standing in my kitchen talking with my Dad and suddenly we hear the (very loud) sound of breaking glass. We went outside and walked around the house looking for broken windows etc; found nothing. The next morning I was getting breakfast and I opened the kitchen cupboard, and glass just poured out onto the counter and all over the floor. tl,dr; every glass in my cupboard shattered simultaneously while my father and I were in the room.
Psychics, palm readers, horoscope readers of Reddit, do you actually believe in your trade or is it just bull shit?	Entirely bs, but guilty to admit that if it is in my favour that day for horoscopes i'd believe the shit out of it.	I used to do palm reading at parties to make some extra cash. I don't believe in it, and I always told everyone it was for "entertainment purposes only". Eventually, though, I had to stop, because people ignored my disclaimer and took it seriously. I didn't want anyone making major life decisions based on the b.s. I made up. It's a shame, though. It was such easy money. Stupid parents raising me with stupid morals.
Reddit, my mother-in-law has been taking my kids "witnessing" door to door. Is it wrong to be upset?	I would say it depends on what you and your husband decided about in which religion you said you would raise your children. If you agreed to raise them atheist then yes be upset, but if you agreed to let them choice what they want then getting upset could be seen as actively pushing atheism on them which would be just as "unfair" as shoving Christianity or Judaism on them.	You already know the answer to this and it has nothing to do with you being an atheist. It is inappropriate for her to do this without your blessing or permission, and you have more than one reason to not give it. She either needs to stop or only get the kids when someone else is around. You may have to find new childcare, and I sympathize because I know that's difficult.
What's the simplest way you improved your quality of life that you think other people could use too?	Take multi-vitamins every day, starting now. I firmly believe it helps lessen the foothold germs can get in my system, and shortens the duration when I do get sick. It's cheap healthcare.	Set up an emergency fund. I can't begin to tell you how much stress is relieved when you don't have to worry about a large expense that came up suddenly. Transmission goes out. It just turns an emergency into an inconvenience.
[Serious] When's the last time you were truly afraid, like a child in a dark room?	Had a nightmare. Woke up and I couldn't breathe. Finally after shaking and fumbling around in the dark I got my lamp on next to my bed. I sat there shaking for a while. Then convinced myself I just needed fresh air. When I tried to stand my legs gave out from under me. Tried crawling to the door. Got there but couldn't get it open from the ground. Eventually just crawled back to my bed and went back to sleep. I don't use the word dread lightly anymore.	Sleeping out in a forest with some friends. Being kept awake by the sound of twigs snapping as something circled us out of sight. Hopefully just a fox but still super scary
Ladies, what proportion of your sexual encounters include an orgasm for you?	Never had an orgasm with a partner. I always get myself to 100% though. However, since I had a habit of sleeping with nerdy guys, I think they also masturbated too much and they couldn't get off with me either most of the time.	I've lost count on how many times I've had sex with the seven men I've been with and not once have I experienced an orgasm with them lol
Girls of Reddit, what are the least successful ways a guy has tried to impress you?	i had a nicely dressed man on a busy street walk up to me seemingly out of nowhere and offer to give me 1000 dollars cash if i would let him fuck me. it was gross and weird, but i fucked him for the money. i guess you could say he was quite successful.	An architecture student named a skyscraper after me. Several days later, he sent me an email saying that I had become his new reason for breathing. I had known him for a week, and I lived 3 states away.
What's a common double standard you see nowadays?	On Twitter I saw a girl asking for a female tattoo artist but if a man asked specifically for male tatoo artist it would be sexist.	People that are proud of the fact that they're a "Bitch" or an "Asshole" then complain when they have no good friends and cannot score a date If your dating profile says "I'll make your dick hard and your life hard" you deserve to be unhappy.
My ex called off our engagement last month. Now I'm finding out why. I feel lost and devistated. Any help?	Dump the cunt, she is fucking you over. "We need some time apart" is whorespeak for "I want another cock inside of me".	The problem with taking a break is that it rarely fixes what is wrong in the relationship. Sounds like she wants out but doesn't want to commit to leaving.
Reddit: What was your most socially awkward moment?	Serving a customer at work who has an accent. I ask if he's from New Jersey. "No I'm actually from a place up north called Yellowstone" I laugh "oh, well at least I didn't say you were from CANADA" Guy is completely staredadding at this time "That is in Canada" Kill me now.	In geography class the teacher asks what the largest or widest waterfall is, I raise my hand to say Victoria Falls (Africa) I get it mixed with Niagra falls and blurt out Viagra falls to the whole class.
Male redditors: what is the stupidest thing you have said to a girl, that blew your chances with her?	"you look familiar!? where do I know you from!?" "my wiener was poking out of shorts one time and you pointed it out [faggy laugh]" "oh, well i have to go, bye"	so one time when i was shit faced, i am making out with this girl sitting on my lap in a room upstairs from a party and her friend walks in. She sit on the girl's lap and they start making out. I fucking said, "Hey you can't do that." And they both walked away.
[Serious]Clubbers of Reddit (Nightclubs not killing animals), what are your best tips for people new to clubbing?	Become a mindless pop-culture drone, armed with the latest buzzwords and dance moves. Strive for mediocrity and ultimate conformity. Original thoughts are bad, yolo-isms are good. Be outgoing when expressing said yolo-isms and fashionable pop culture trends. Become a connoisseur of everything tasteless and pompous. Focus on posturing, body language, and other forms of primitive instinctual communication. Try and hone in on the reptilian part of your brain. Talk about the latest Bradley Cooper movie. Take at least 1 selfie an hour. Have your parents trade in your Camry for a leased BMW 3 series in white. No joke. That's the formula. Good luck.	Don't let your mum buy you some hair gel or whatever shit youngsters put on their hair nowadays.....and if she does check before application that it is definitely not gel that glows under UV light so you aren't walking round a club looking like a complete tit with a glowing head like happened to me back in the late 90s.
What can men get away with that women can't?	Doing Science. Doing Technology. **EDIT** oops. I don't mean women *can't* do science or technology. I mean that our society tends to try and steer them away from those fields. When a man enters a STEM field in school it's all "welcome aboard". When a woman does it's "are you sure"? Unless it's medicine. **EDIT 2** At worst women who study STEM have to put up with a ton of shit that is designed to discourage them. At best they have to put up with a bunch of "you go girl" BS like they're some kind of hero when all they want to do is be treated like their male peers. Which is why "Men can get away with it". Because it's no big deal when we do it.	My boyfriend loves going to the pub and chatting with the geezers, all men. Sometimes I wish there was a public room full of tipsy old ladies I could chat to.
What widely believed misconception, or flat out lie, is so common it makes you furious?	That GMOs are bad for you. That vaccines are bad. That 9/11 was vastly different than the official story. That vitamins or herbal supplements are beneficial. Or that the herbal supplements you buy in the store are even what they say on the bottle. That acupuncture works. It doesn't. That chiropractic works. No it doesn't. And no you or your mom feeling better after going doesn't prove shit.	Perhaps not quite what OP asked for, but it fits: I work for the municipal bus system in a town with a major university. There is a rumor that if you get hit by one of our buses, you'll get free tuition. No. Don't walk in front of a bus. Don't even joke about walking in front of a bus. It wasn't funny the first time, and it's still not funny. If you do get hit by a bus, you'll be lucky if you don't end up in the hospital. You're more likely to die than get free tuition. Stop asking me about it. And for the love of God, LOOK BEFORE YOU CROSS THE STREET.
What is far easier than it looks?	Proving there was no collusion. Congress wasting money on investigation, bad. Should build the wall, more deals like healthcare, the best in the world!	Working out. You don't have to go in breaking records or keeping up with anybody else, just go at your own pace and increase from there. Been at it almost daily for 3 years now and I am glad that I have been.
Teachers of Reddit, what is the funniest thing that one of your students have gotten in trouble for where you had to pretend to be mad?	Easy. Last Friday... white boy goes off about BLM and how he has every right to use n**ger ... black girl tells him, (among other things) to take his casserole eatin ass and sit down. O.o #notmadatit	I once had a student (high school) consistently wear a large pop tart box on his head and proclaim himself the "Pop Tart King."
[Serious] Long time teachers of reddit, what differences do you observe in your students today, and the students you taught 5,10,20 years ago?	51,020 is how you would punctuate that number. But no living teacher had students that long ago; the oldest humans haven't made it much past 100 years old.	They're getting taller. 14 years a teacher at secondary level (11-16 yrs) and the number who are taller than me (6ft 1in) gets bigger every year. Nutrition seems to continue improving, and my (admittedly anecdotal) experience is that fewer smoke nowadays. Not that we are breeding supermen. They seem very fragile nowadays as well, hiding from wind and rain like it was lethal rather than just unpleasant. Going for a walk on outdoor trips is like one long complaint...
What is a song lyric that hits you hard?	"...one good girl is worth a thousand bitches..." -kanye I always heard him say pictures and not bitches, i am kinda addicted to porn and that lyric always hits me even though he does not sing about porn addiction. To me that verse is about addiction.	And then one day you find, Ten years have got behind you, No one told you when to run, You missed the starting gun.
What's something illegal you're proud of?	Pirating shitty AAA games that ask for $60+ DLC/Season Pass $60 and aren't even good when they come out and you need to wait 1-2months patches before it gets playable.	I have no idea if this is illegal (probably), but I made a radio transponder out of an arduino and some other parts and have been using it to chill in NYU buildings that the students get into with the RFID chips in their IDs.
What 'fan theories' have blown your mind with their devastating logic?	the HAES (healthy at every size) fan theories as to why people gain weight are gobsmackingly dumb. Equally mind blowing are their thoughts as to why people can't lose weight. They will make your head hurt. It's fairly sad. It's devastating in that there are people who actually believe it and are likely leading themselves to an early death plagued with diabetes, hypertension, and a whole assortment of health problems.	The idea in the Terminator movie, that there's at least one previous timeline before the movie happens, possibly much more. Or that the machines are doing this intentionally to create a loop in which it makes itself more powerful by constantly sending back future tech, and that's why our technology is progressing so quickly. Each time they do the dance again they have more tech from the future to work with and essentially infinite time to improve themselves. Actually given they're essentially immortal, maybe this is how they keep themselves alive in the face of the sun dying out some day. They've created this time loop to live and grow in endlessly.
What is the most frustrating rule you've come across at school or work?	No smoke breaks until your tables are finished, have left, and are bussed. I get it, but people can eat for ten minutes, fuck around on their cell phones for twenty, etc., and I can't take a less than five minute smoke break.	When I was in elementary school, the Student Patrols decided that there would be no reading on the bus. Why? Because if there was an accident or the bus caught fire, we'd be too distracted by the book to notice the danger.
What commonly liked food do you hate and why?	Garlic. It poisons everything it touches with its foul, acrid taste. It makes your breath, your body and your house stink when you cook/eat it, too.	For me it is seafood. All seafood, no matter the type or preparation. When I was little I got food poisoning twice in the same week from different kinds, and now even the smell of fish makes me feel sick.
How can I comfort my children through this hard time?	If this is a troll, it is the most heartless troll I have ever read. Good luck to you. Just be there as much as possible and give as much love as possible. That's all you can do. Of course, you are there for them all the time and for whatever they need. There is really not much more that you can do, besides being there and loving your children. You are an excellent mother.	Look: you have a few months to provide your son a lifetime. You have a lifetime to be sad. My advice: create a lifetime of memories in 6 months. do everything he/she has ever wanted and anything you can think of that is fun. You're going to go into debt on this one, but that is not important. Cheeseburgers and candy for breakfast. See Istanbul. Drugs. Rent a sports car for him whatever his age. Disneyland. Halloween costumes everyday. Rent a bouncy castle and put it in your living room. Take your other kid out of school. A missed year is fucking meaningless in comparison. Picnics. Call make a wish. From now on nothing is too outrageous or over the top. edit: spelling.
Add 'ING' to the end of a movie title, what's it about now?	Suicide Squatting - taking a shit and killing yourself at the same time. ie, a movie about the making of Suicide Squad.	Kill Billing: A woman wakes up from a coma with a vengeance and dedicates her life to wreaking havoc on the accounting department at work.
What is a skill, despite all our modern technology, we had more mastery over in a previous point in history?	True virtuosos of music The 19th century alone created Beethoven,Haydn,Liszt,Mozart and Schubert. Fast forward to the 21st century and we have yet to see a musician that can reach the same standards as these composers.	Handwriting. My parents have beautiful handwriting, mine is pretty sloppy. They often criticize me for it, but on the other hand only one of us can type 80 words-per-minute using a keyboard.
I told my brother that I wanted to try a Dorito taco at Taco Bell, and he told me that I was a "victim of the capitalist marketing agenda." What painful encounters have you had with overly self-righteous people?	I was disappointed with the dorito taco. The shell just has a faint taste of doritos. Bought one to try it...Wont buy another.	My best friend likes to spew conspiracy theories she doesn't understand. A few days ago she told my boyfriend (future biologist) that she didn't believe in DNA polymerase. wat
What are some other examples of "calm down" syndrome? Things that people say to you in seemingly good nature, but never achieve anything other than piss you off?	“Have a blessed day.” This one really pisses me off based on the assumption I buy into whatever belief system that they do. I’m not even remotely anti any religion at this point in my life but I still don’t like people pushing it on me.	"Let me explain something to you," when debating an issue. It's a condescending line. It didn't need to precede what you're about to say.
What are some parenting "cheat codes"?	* Never threaten anything you are not going to follow through with. If you do threaten, follow through 100% - every time. * If both of your kids are fighting over a toy, take it away - every time. * If your kid every says I am bored, give them a chore to do. They will never be bored again. * Don't give long drawn out explanations to kids - they don't care. Because I said so works fine. * Develop "the look". Both my husband and I could stop our kids cold by "looking" at them. (My direct reports also mention the "look". I guess I have it perfected). * Don't help your kids with homework. Let them do it themselves. They learn responsibility and sometimes failure. Trust me, a C or D in fourth grade just doesn't matter. Just check if it is done.	When my son gets a bump, scratch, or some other "ouch" I tell him to "shake it off so it doesn't stick." He'll shake what ever hurts, and that's the end of it. But if it's something a bit more major he'll tell me "It's stuck to me!" and I know that's something I need to investigate. It gives him a way to take care of things on his own, and empowers him a little. I've been doing this with him starting with when he was a baby. He's four now. Edit: words
My wife just said "that'll do pig" to a complete stranger who helped us. In what ways have YOU been completely embarrassed by someone you're with?	my mom called the dude at meijier who helped put bags in out car a "gentleman and a scholar". This guy was far far from that.	This story isn't from someone who was with me, but it's worth telling. My aunt was with her husband and two daughters at a restaurant, the latter of whom were aged around 11 and 9 at the time. The kids are being rowdy and not listening to their parents' orders for them to control themselves, and my aunt finally says, "If you two don't stop right now, I'm going to do something that will make you very, very embarrassed." They don't stop. She then removes her shirt and starts twirling it above her head like a lasso, standing there in her bra, making very conspicuous cheering noises. End result: unimpressed husband, mortified daughters.
[Serious] Reddit, what's currently stressing you out, and how can we help?	No one can help me, but these people can help themselves. A lot of people in my town love to hate the police, but none of them actually know anything of the law. It's really frustrating when ignorant uneducated people think they know what they're talking about, when they really don't. And then they think they can criticize the police, when they have no idea what it is they're talking about. It's really annoying.	That my best friend just died. He was riding a motorcycle and I was following behind him in a car. I was the first person on the scene. I saw his face. I heard him fighting for air through is broken nose and broken neck. I talked to him 6 days a week for the last 5 years whether it be a real conversation or me just sending him a funny link I found here on Reddit. We were supposed to get an apartment together next week. I drove cross country with him. Best memories I have are with him. He wants me to travel and be successful, when he was always the more educated one. Rooting for me when I needed it most. Now he is gone. And I will have to become successful without him. Rest easy Kevin.
What is your favorite word to say out loud?	In high school we played "The Penis Game" all the time. Here are the rules: - Someone whispers "penis" as quietly as possible - Next person says "penis" a tad louder - Next person says "penis" louder than the last - Incrementally gets louder until people are screaming "penis"	Smock. Smock smock smock smock smock smock smock smock smock smock smock smock smock smock smock smock smock smock smock smock smock smock smock.
The "Price Is Right" game on Wii starts with a disclaimer reminding you that you will not actually win any of the prizes featured in the game. What other absurd disclaimers &amp; warnings have you come across?	Why is this absurd? People would actually believe that they won the prizes if that disclaimer were not there. In fact, I am sure people *still* thought they won prizes. This is what disclaimers are for. By your reasoning, any disclaimer is "absurd".	My friend had a magic set that came in a box a little bigger than a shoe box. On the front was a photograph of a young boy who was very excited to be doing a magic trick. The disclaimer in the bottom corner read "Little boy not included."
What was the best thing the "Quiet Kid" has said or done in class?	Im usually the quiet kid, every now and agaim the biggestnidiotnin our math 2 honors class starts makimg a scene and i will lay into him how much everybody hates him, but only when im especially annoyed	Once it was right before winter break and just as the bell was about to ring to end class, our teacher cut in with "Oh, I forgot, you have homework over the break!" Everyone groaned, and even the quiet kid in the corner let out an "what an asshole". Well, teacher heard it and said "What did you say?" to the kid. To his credit, he put his head up and loudly said "WHAT. AN. ASS. HOLE" &#x200B; We all stated cracking up and the teacher's face turned so red. I caught up with the kid after the break and his excuse was "the teacher already heard it anyway, I wasn't going to get away with it, so since he asked I answered."
Just heard on the news that 3 young boys beat a disabled father of 12 to death. Looked up one of the murderers on Facebook to see that his "nickname" is Dat-Killer. What's the most screwed up thing you've seen in the past week?	You know, I dunno if the American media is just really racist or something, but on the rare occasion that I see a story like this, the perp has a disproportional chance of being a minority.	I'm a crime reporter, so yeah, there's a lot quite often... Last week three young men were shot in town while walking home from church. One died. I was stopped in the neighborhood by a nearby resident and she was going off about how the neighborhood was falling apart and how she doesn't feel bad for the people shot, because they lived in this giant house with like 20 people and were always causing a ruckus. That shit was harsh.
What do people brag about that is not worth bragging about?	When they refer to a sports team as "we" when they're not on the team "Hey Jim, was watching the game last night, did you see when *we* totally kicked the other teams ass?" "Yeah, I knew the championship was going to be a tough game, but I knew *we* would pull through" It's not your accomplishment! Want to watch it? fine. Want to talk about it? fine. Referring to the teams accomplishments like you were somehow involved? Go fuck yourself	The size or utility of their genitalia. It's like bragging about how tall you are, or how long your nose is. Your skill and determination contributed literally nothing to making this happen.
Reddit, we hear about creepy ghost stories all the time. What are some of your more wholesome encounters with the paranormal?	I thought I saw a ghost one time that scared a fart out of me. That fart scratched my butthole for me. It all worked out.	If sleep paralysis counts: I woke up one night with SP and there was my (now deceased) granddad playing with his (also deceased) dog in my room It looked so real and fun I almost cried after it
What is something you feel is a pointless invention and why?	I used to think the iPad was pretty useless, because you wouldn't really want to do serious work on it, and it wasn't that convenient to carry around. But now I see the market for it. Now what I think is useless is "phablets". Devices that are bigger than a phone but smaller than a tablet. It sounds like the most awkward size possible.	There is an infomercial for a robotic parakeet that just sits there and tweets. It is the silliest thing I've ever seen
What habit is generally percieved as healthy, but really isn't ?	Marathon and long distance running really isn't as good for you as many people think it is. I mean, yes, there are some people who happen to have bodies great for it. But there are also lots of people who can do serious damage to their bodies running long distance (have a friend who destroyed the cartilage in his knees at a young age from running long distance, for one).	Constantly sanitizing everything. Certain things need to be sanitized for safe use but a lot of bacteria that keeps our immune systems functioning/improving are destroyed in the process, leaving us susceptible to diseases we could have been immune to.
What was the horniest/sexiest tension you've had in the strangest/most boring places?	I broke the bro code years ago. Dude and his longtime gf broke up. He cheated on her and she wanted revenge and out of all the dudes we were friends with she hooked up with me. That day dear reddit, i was a sexual dynamo. A long stroking champion experience i was never able to duplicate. Thing is, his gf and i hated each other. However, when she showed up and said "fuck me you asshole" i pulled her in my stank ass bachelor pad and smashed that puss. Lost a bro over it. Didnt care...hottest sex i ever had.	I was at the dentist, squirted a bit of saliva out of my mouth, and the female dental hygienist says, "Oh, you're a squirter! Me too!"
What wine would go well with McDonalds?	Something from genetically modified grapes, with lots of preservatives. Is there perhaps a type of wine that through its production causes animals to be tortured while at the same time causes children to become obese? If so I would go with that one.	For "chicken" or filet-o-fish dishes, I suggest a dry white - Thunderbird should do. For "beef" and McPork, you should opt for a smoky or flavorful red, like Wild Irish Rose, or Night Train.
In memory of a friend that just passed, what's your best memory of someone who has passed away?	When we were playing DnD, we killed a dragon in an underground cave. The skeleton sank to the bottom of a pond. He wanted to retrieve the skull for a trophy, but drown in the process. We defeated the dragon, but he died for hubris.	One of my battle buddies lost his fight against PTSD. He was a great man and excellent NCO. He killed himself and life after just hasn't been the same. I think of him frequently and my other battle buddies thst have died in combat or suicide from PTSD, but especially this weekend.
What is it like to not get married and live a life alone?	I work at a homeless shelter for seniors. They found love in a homeless place and so will you eventually. Hopefully.	Every time you swallow something that you didn't fully chew, you think to yourself, "no one will be here to give me the Heimlich, this is how I die." Then you somehow get the food down and cheat death yet again.
Hobbyists of Reddit, what is a good hobby to pick up in 2018?	The name's Hermit! Furtive Hermit! And I come before you people tonight with an idea. Probably the greatest...aw it's not for you. It's more of a 4chan hobby. But alright, I'll tell you anyway. Minature monorails! I've suggested mini-monos to Pintrest, Instagram, and Snoop Dogg's Twitter page and by gum it put them on the map! Well sir there's nothing on earth like a genuine, bonafide, electrified, six-car monorail! What'd I say?	I knew a guy who bought a hive and queen, then went around his neighborhood at night, planting flowering shrubs.
Tall people of Reddit, what are some height related struggles that short and average sized people don't have to worry about?	I'm barely 6'1" but get told on a near daily basis "you're tall" by customers and co-workers. No you're short and because of that I have to get that that off the slightly high shelf for you.	If you go into the basement of any building built before 1900 you have to hunch over like a velociraptor the entire time
What's the most fascinating tidbit of psychology you know?	If you are depressed you are very self-absorbed. At first this offended me, but then I started considering it and there is a truth to it unless you're specifically depressed because you're mourning or because of understandable reasons. The reality is that depression is simply a chemical misbalance, but it's actually true; when you're depressed you think too much about yourself and fail to consider your influence on others and become unable to see your situation from a distance. You tend to victimize yourself and catastrophize "it's hopeless! Nothing is worth it anymore" but you're actually just getting obsessed about yourself	The Lake Wobegon effect. Human tendency is to describe oneself as above average in any number of traits: looks, driving abilities, etc. Of course, statistically we cannot all be above average, but when polled more than half a population will respond that they are above average. The psychologist who coined the term was referring to a fictional town, Lake Wobegon, where everyone is attractive and excellent.
Reddit, what's the scariest/most fucked up dream you remember having?	In one of my dreams, i was at comic con (nerdy i no) and mark Hamill waled out. I sicced a dog on him and killed him. I immediately woke up and thought "GODdammit i killed luke skywaker now i have to move to mexico."	I had this weird dream that I was sitting in an old porcelain bathtub with a good friend. He tells me he is sick, starts turning into crackled gray stone, and slowly starts disintegrating into dust all while I am still sitting in this tub crying and watching him die. Once he was completely gone I was left sitting in all his ashes holding a bracelet I had made for him.
If you knew you were going to die, what is the last thing you would do immediately before your death?	Do the everythin you havnt done... be prostitue run around naked as long as its daring and something i would never do.	Poop and/or pee. Everyone knows you void your bowels when you die and I don't wanna have a big 'ol shit in my pants.
I had a friend who died saving someone else. What selfless thing have you seen/heard about that inspired you?	I am just gonna be that guy. Jesus died to save mankind from sin. He was whipped, beaten, humiliated and left to die hanging on a cross.	Pierlucio Tinazzi. There was a horrendous fire in the Mont Blanc tunnel in 1999, so bad that the emergency services had given up all hope. At that point Pierlucio put on some breathing equipment, hopped on his motorcycle and rode into the flaming tunnel. He saved 10 people, and died as he dragged a truck driver to safety. Not only is he incredibly heroic, he gets style points for riding in to save the day on a motorcycle.
Which fictional character do you relate yourself most to and why??	There is not really any single character that I relate to more than any other, but there are a lot that I kinda see myself in in certain aspects. *Questionable Content* - **Claire** - Awesome trans gal, makes ridiculous puns and isn't ashamed about it, probably closest to me overall. *Steven Universe* - **Pearl** - Kinda nervous/anxious and sometimes a touch obsessive about things being certain ways, but can break the rules when it's truly important -- if it really matters to her, or would really matter to someone in her family. *Steven Universe* - **Peridot** - An outsider, and kind of a nerd, but she's learning how to be empathetic and how to take herself less seriously.	Since I'm a dwarf, everyone and their mum assumes it's Tyrion Lannister. I love Tyrion, but I don't relate myself to him that much. Finbar Mcbride on the other hand, another character played by Peter Dinklage, is me all over - introverted, stoic, and asocial as fuck. Even wears the same plain formal clothes as me. Watching The Station Agent felt like watching a documentary about myself...if I lived in New jersey.
Girls of r/gonewild what is the creepiest PM you've gotten from a redditor?	After I posted my story on /r/relationships I got a shit ton of PM's asking me if I wanted to go through it again/do stuff to them along with pics. I'm a minor...	I had a guy hell bent on reminding me at least once per day that he wanted to get me pregnant. Edit: I have an alt - It's not this account.
What is the creepiest, scariest, strangest unexplained experience/ story you've had, heard or know?	As a baby I cried a lot. One night in my crib I was screaming and whatever. This is an image I think from infancy which creeps me out. But a huge white skull came out of my closet. (Huge). And like floated right threw me and I passed out.	On the morning of my mother's funeral, I didn't want to get out of bed. I didn't want to socialize or thank people for coming. As I lay there, I felt the bed compress as if someone sat on it. I swear she was telling me one last time to get the fuck up before I'm late.
What rules were created just because of you?	As a kid, I used to prank call Hooked on Phonics every single day. You know, 1-800-ABC-DEFG. I started on Payphones and then was so obsessed that I dared to it from the home phone. Finally they said, "we know your number now, don't call again or we'll call the police." I think I finally stopped then, or maybe I just got interested in boobs instead.	not me, but the intro to engineering class at UCF has a competition where groups must create a self powered boat to race an orange around the circumference of the reflection pond. The pond is maybe 100ft in diameter. One year one group used a lawnmower engine to power their boat, and the same year a group used bottle rockets. Upon starting the race, the lawnmower group's boat tipped over in the middle an poured gasoline into the pond. At the same time the other group lit their bottle rockets which promptly ignited the spilled gasoline and set the pond on fire. They created a new rule after that year: no gasoline powered boats.
What is the most "Dwight Scrute" thing a coworker has done?	My supervisor is obsessed with art and music and he is a housekeeping supervisor. His skills are not needed here	When I worked in security I had a guard quit because we didn't all refer to each other as "Officer _____."
What is the worst excuse someone has given for breaking up with you?	She wasn't sexually attracted to me and didn't want to touch me because I am "actually a girl" (I'm a trans man) and she didn't want to "turn gay". She told me this as we started dating. Okay fair enough I guess. I really liked her so I was okay with it and kept dating her, hoping she'd change her mind. Then I told her I wasn't sexually attracted to her because I'm asexual. This was not okay with her, and she broke up with me because "I don't think I can date someone who isn't sexually attracted to me." At that point I wasn't even heartbroken anymore.	"I used to have a crush on him. I guess I just need to see if there's any feelings left, but I dont want you dating anyone else while I figure this out for me."
English teachers, why do you try so hard to find hidden meanings in books where there are none?	Dear OP why you gotta be a dick? You're gonna be the same idiot adult who complains about teachers when you're little snot nosed brat is doing poor academically and you can't fathom why.	“I hate metaphors. That’s why my favorite book is *Moby Dick*. No frou-frou symbolism, just a good, simple tale about a man who hates an animal.” - Ron Swanson
What's the best t-shirt that you own?	I have a Microsoft Bing shirt with the bing logo in the bottom left corner on the front that I had to earn via their reward points program before they took off all the physical merchandise and replaced it with points cards. American Apparel, the most comfortable and best fitting shirt I own since I dropped a bunch of weight. Also, my middle name is Bingham. Best thing to come out of that search engine.	My Wilford brimley " You know i have diabetes!" T-shirt always shocks people when i wear it out, Many people have told me its offensive claiming they have diabetes that's when i whip out the ole insulin pen and say " You know i have diabetes!".
[Serious] People from Axis World War II countries, at times like today when the Allies are celebrating, how do you remember your dead? Is it even socially acceptable to commemorate your war dead in your country?	My family fought in the Blue division for Germany as Spanish Volunteers. We celebrate them killing Bolshevik filth. Be it the republicans or the Soviets he fought.	We remembered our fallen this year at May 18. Flags on poles and speeches made, visits to graveyards. I am a from Finland and although we were not really with the Axis, most people like to lump us together with them.
What myth might end up killing you one day?	Global warming. And by that, I mean an angry mob of leftists assaulting me for having an opinion contrary to the one they deem acceptable.	The myth that "lightning never strikes twice in the same place." You don't want to be there when it does.
[Serious] Are there actually people out there who enjoy life, or are we all just faking it / lying to ourselves / too busy to notice one way or the other? If you life-enjoyers are out there, what's it like?	It is hard to say what it is like because I don't know what it is like not to enjoy life. I can't even understand how you can't enjoy life. Stuff sucks sometimes, but unless your life is made up of an unrelenting torrent of horrible it is beyond me how you don't enjoy it. My default emotion is "happy" and it takes active interference to make it anything else. If interference is removed I go make to being "happy".	I stumbled into a job/field that turns out I really enjoy. The office and library work is mostly bearable and sometimes even exciting. The field work is the kind that gets me excited and running on nothing but fumes from dawn to dusk. It's archaeology. As for everything else, well, I think it's best to not be cheap with your hobbies and pastimes. Don't under indulge.
What psychological tricks do you know?	If you smash you friends head against the table enough times, he becomes disabled. Now thats some serious phychology right there for you: from a human to potato in 15 seconds	Get people to contribute to an idea and they will be more likely to accept it. Studies show that it doesn't take that much involvement in the creative process to get people to take possession of a proposed plan.
Parents of Reddit, what's the one thing you wish you were told before you had your first child?	That you are about to take a 10 year break from your friends (and it will cost you most of your money)	You are going to get pissed at your baby. When this happens put it somewhere safe close the door and go outside to relax. The baby will be fine.
Ever know a teacher who got busted for something kind of bad that turned into something horrifying once all the details came out?	Junior year my math teacher told my ex that she looked like a younger version of his wife and continued to make derogatory comments towards her for the first quarter of school. We were both in the same math class. He was jealous of me and did all he could to make pre-calc/trig miserable for me. I was always a good student but he scrutinized my papers extra hard. I would copy some one else's HW and get a D while the other person got an A . I convinced my then girl friend to have a racey conversation with him one day after class while her phone recorded it. We black mailed him into giving me a good grade. I would have earned it on my own if he wasn't such a cock.	There was a new teacher at my high school who was awesome. Hilarious, his class was easily the best part of every day. He made assignments fun by joking around a lot and doing unusual experiments. Guy was real smart and could recite entire encyclopedia passages about random topics. ... and then he left his family to run away with a junior from one of his classes.
What vegetarian food do meat lovers massively underestimate?	Tofu is actually better than meat. It's just that most people don't know how to cook it and then go off saying "TOFU SUCKS, VEGETARIANS LOL."	I knew a vegetarian lady from China who cooked me a meal made almost entirely of tofu. Seasoned it like it was meat, the works. It was only after we'd finished that she told me there wasn't a scrap of meat on the table. It was fucking dynamite.
Girls, what do guys do that they think is being manly but in reality is the furthest thing from it?	I used to think men who spent almost all their time at the gym and took good care of their bodies were really attractive but then I found out that it is usually because they are insecure and don't have any friends to hang out with.	I met a few guys who didn't want to drink a frappucino from starbucks or a smoothie from jamba juice because they thought those drinks were too "girly" for them. I don't see how drinks can be "girly" or why that would stop them from enjoying a delicious smoothie.
Stop being so damn humble! What's the nicest thing you've ever done for someone?	Every time my wife gets angry and aggressive with me, I've resisted the urge to punch her in her fucking face like she deserves.	Back when I played basketball competitively, we had a really terrible player on our team, great guy, he just could not play for the life of him. He hadn't scored a single point all season, and we were on a fast break and instead of taking my clear drive down the lane I stopped and gave him the ball and he made the shot. His mom started crying and everybody on the sidelines went nuts for him.
What is something that you found normal until people started pointing it out?	We brush the exposed portion of our skeleton with minty plant stuff to make it shiny, then lay down paralyzed and disable our senses for eight hours to hallucinate things we usually don't bother to remember.	My family goes out to brunch a lot. Didn't think it was weird until my girlfriend pointed out I was going to my 9th organized brunch that month.
What was your 'holy shit, this is amazing' moment in gaming?	First clear of the Vault of Glass was something special. Too bad they couldn’t bring that feeling back with any of the other raids (including Leviathan)	The ending of Bastion. Carrying Zulf to safety despite what he'd done, his people forgiving me despite what I'd done.
Who was the worst teacher you had, and why?	The one who taught us feminism by getting naked on stage, brought out a naked disabled hooker, lay on the ground, put cream in both their but cracks and then had a small french bull dog lick it of. Can you tell I go to an arts university.	My 3rd grade teacher spent 1 day EVERY WEEK of 3rd grade teaching us about whales and why we should save them. We had whale 'pen pals,' we watched videos on whale migration, we wrote letters to conservation groups, we all became junior members (or something like that) of wild life organizations. It was out of control. Parents and the principal actually had to step in. At first it was pretty cool, but week after week it just became boring and weird.
[UPDATE] I've created an imaginary person 10 years ago, and now he's become completely integral to my life. What do I do?	Hello. We don't know each other (and perhaps never will till your novel comes out) but I think there are underlying feelings of hurt that you've kept with you in order to construe this lie.	Wouldn't it be crazy if Brad just showed up some gathering, asking why you haven't spoken to him in months? And everyone demanded to know why you're acting so weird to him lately. You then explained to everyone Brad isn't real and you have no idea who this man is, but then everyone started showing their cell phone pics of you embracing each other at your last birthday or something. This could be a premise of a movie.
[Serious] Straight guys who've been with Transgender girls, what were your experiences like?	I had fun sucking her cock. It was kind of an excuse to try it out without feeling, I dunno, too gay about it. That said, it was ultimately unfulfilling, since she didn't have a pussy to fuck, wasn't into anal, and I don't cum from oral.	Throwaway here. I've been with a few MTF transgendered girls. I'll never do it again. Hear me out. I realize now, to me it's just a fetish, and that's how I looked at it. It's a cute chick with a dick, a fantasy to me. I wasn't thinking about the real person with feelings and desire to be the gender they really want to be. A person doesn't want to be seeked out, and have someone sleeping with them, only because it satisfies a fetish. Most people want to sleep with someone because they're wanted or horny. Not to objectified and viewed as a sexual fetishized "thing". Sorry if that wasn't the answer you wanted.
What is something people do meaning well that really gets on your nerves?	Saying bless you..or God bless you. Everytime I fucking sneeze. How am I supposed to respond. Thank You! Thank you for acknowledging my bodily functions. I say amen the next time you fart.	My MIL buys tons of gifts for us that we have zero interest in, cheesy knick knack type stuff. I don't want every surface in my house covered in useless decorative items that don't fit my tastes or style! But I smile, thank her, and put then in a closet for a year or two before donating them to a thrift store because she loves us and means well.
Anyone else almost 30 years old, with no idea what they want to do with their life?	I'm 25. I have a set career path for the next couple of years. But I don't really have any decent hobbies that are healthy, creative or social. I drink a ton of craft beer and spend a lot of time trying to obtain rare stuff by going to breweries or trading on the internet. I also really like nerdy baseball stats. I also get drunk and play Magic the Gathering with my buddies. I'm always doing something and getting out of my house, but it seems like I'm not really accomplishing anything and it's kind of hard to explain my passions to other people, especially girls who don't really find the stuff I do really attractive.	It's definitely a struggle, that's for sure. Most people never find their true passions. They just do what everyone else does. What society expects and more or less manage to be content. But that's bullshit of-course. Living is more than just drawing breath and having a moderate degree of happiness. But it's hard to find purpose, passion. Takes a lot of soul searching and a lot of time spent trying out new things, learning new stuff and so forth. Not knowing what to do at 30 isn't that special. As I said, most probably never find that "something" till the day they die. Keep on exploring this world of hours. This life you've been given. That's all you can do really. I bet you haven't even explored 1% of all that's possible for you in this life. Too early to stop looking and concluding that there's nothing there. :)
What's the worst plan you've ever been a part of?	Some friends and I went on a camping trip which was essentially centered around vodka, a campfire and chatting. It took place in the summer so we didn't take a tent, and instead my friend convinced us to bring a pallet to use as a table, and our sleeping bags. So, as the night drew to a close, I found that there was nowhere on the ground to sleep that wasn't really grassy or muddy. In my drunken state I decided to sleep on the pallet, and quickly dozed off. Needless to say, when I woke I was pretty stiff and achy from having slept on such an uncomfortable surface. Shit sucked. TL;DR, slept on a pallet, deformed my own spine.	Tried to skip school by hiding under a blanket on my bedroom floor. My mom came in the room and thought I had went to school, but then tripped over me when she walked over the blanket. Not one of my best ideas.
What is an unrealistic expectation people with a lot of money have of people who are not as well off financially?	That the overweight poor could just eat less junk and more vegetables to lose weight and be healthy. I have never been really poor (maybe in my late teens early 20's) but I can tell you that making the big switch to juicing, and a fresh, plant based diet felt impossible for me until I made over 50k. Now, I know that isn't true, however, I have always felt that I have considerable will power, and I am pretty well informed regarding health conscious choices in diet and lifestyle. If it can be that hard for me, what kind of chance does someone who was raised on McDonald's and boxed mac and cheese, while trying to stretch 150 dollars through the month stand?	Buying gifts for every occasion. Birthdays, holidays, weddings, baby showers, wedding showers, engagements, graduations. With all of the people in my life, I honestly don't have the money to get gifts for every little milestone or special occasion. I love my family and friends, but it always makes me feel like crap when I can't afford a gift for them when everyone else seems to be able to. Edit: A word.
How do I politely make this kind of crazy girl stop texting me?	You are the worst person I have ever had the displeasure of knowing... You ruined this girl's life. All you had to do was ignore every text and call. Instead you went Karma whoring on reddit and attention whoring in real life.	How come more people haven't called this out for being absolutely obvious bullshit? The OP decides to ask reddit about his problem, the problem escalates to nude photos, physical confrontations, police restraining orders and someone making the decision to change schools, ALL IN FIVE FUCKING HOURS? Goddamnit, redditors use your heads. Real life doesn't play out with this kind of accelerated soap opera bullshit.
What is a conspiracy theory you actually believe in?	First responders will not work as hard to save a critically injured person's life if they have 'organ donor' on their ID, figuring they can save more lives by harvesting their organs instead.	That the AskReddit threads asking "What is a conspiracy theory you actually believe in" is 50% intelligence agencies and 50% news outlets. both are looking to know what people are thinking of, but for different reasons.
Reddit, What is your worst "wait, I can explain..." moment?	Once I was walking through the dining hall when I passed by one chef saying to another chef "cut meat and then cut vegetables on the same board." I was like "what the actual fucking fuck." so I waited until he left and asked the other chef what in the world was going on before I sued the college, and he said "OH. We were doing an interview. I asked him for an example of cross-contamination." Don't do your interviews in plain view in your establishment... You might get your ass sued if people don't ask for clarification	I was clipping my pubes, just then my step-brother walks in. He is 7 years old. Later at the dinner table, he proclaims to his mom i was playing with my pee-pee. It was horrible.
It seems like reddit recently has been nothing but tales of abusive, twisted, horrible families and it's getting depressing. Reddit, how awesome is your (immediate, extended, in-laws, whatever) family?	I'm the only person in my family that doesn't smoke. Like, all the descendants back to my great grandpa and grandma are smokers. Over half of them have been to treatment for drugs or alcohol, and I'm the first one to ever go to a four year college. Five of my cousins had kids by 17, and one of them had two by 18. Almost every single graduation party ends in a fistfight, including mine. And you know what? We have a goddamn ball when we're together and we all have a kick ass relationship. I wouldn't trade them for the world. Edit: Rephrasing	I grew up with my whole extended family around the corner. For every major and minor holiday, we all celebrated together. Over 20 of us for every Mother's Day, Birthday, Valentine's Day and a handful of summer BBQs all together each year. And I won't forget Christmas being a 2 week long tradition - filled with caroling, sushi nights, bowling nights, visiting Santa in the city and making pies. I love my family more than any of them know and they helped me get through a lot of hard times; they mean the world to me. I only hope my kids will have a childhood like I did.
[Serious] Redditors whose SO earns significantly more/less than you: how does it affect your relationship?	Ok so I have a weird situation. I loved this girl she left. It's taken a few years but we talking again... Since she lefte her life has gone down hill... Bad houses no jobs no money. I on the other hand started a new part of my life and make decent money. Now the crazy part. She's my ex but she knows if she needs a little help to ask... I don't say know because I already know how much courage she had to muster just to ask me at all	This relates to a previous relationship (you can see where this is going). I started making much more than her (3x-4x). She had expensive tastes which she wasn't really ready to give up on (think cars, handbags, posh dining, etc). Rather than talk to her, I just resented her spending quietly and once in a while I would blow up. I just felt that she wasn't pulling her weight in the earning department, and I was bearing most of the cost for her expensive tastes. Don't do what I did. Talk, and everything will be fine.
If every person was given a Guide to Adulthood handbook on their eighteenth birthday, filled with brutal honesty and accompanied with illustrations, what would be some things in it?	"No matter how much you love Bernie Sanders, you will become a republican once you get your first real paycheck"	#Section 7 - Electronics **7.1 - Kitchen Appliances** Every so often, you will buy a small kitchen appliance you don't need. Here are the instructions for a few of them: --- Blender: Step 1 - Eat nothing but blended food for a whole day. Step 2 - Put in cupboard and never use again.
African redditors, what can you tell us about your country or continent that you think non-Africans are not aware of/would find very interesting?	Africa is a large continent with many countries. Those countries have many different cultures, languages, etc. You won't gain much from grouping them all together.	I am Nigerian American. You would be surprised at the amount of people that don't know that the official language of Nigeria is English. I can't tell you the amount of time that I seriously get asked if I speak African or if they speak African in Nigeria.
[Serious] Does the legal principle of "Ignorance of the law is no excuse for breaking it" make any sense now that we have around 300,000,000 words of law (so that nobody can know all of them)?	Yes. Otherwise - "Oh, sorry for killing your friend, i didn't know murder was illegal." Maybe not that extreme, but it would open up so many ways to cheat the law that there might as well be no laws at all.	Most laws are just specific variations of a few basic principles, aren't they: Don't **harm/kill** anyone or **steal/destroy/vandalize** things that aren't yours.
What was the worst time you mistakenly thought someone was making a sexual advance on you?	The only times I thought someone was making a sexual advance on me but I was wrong, was when they WERE making sexual advances on me, but only for the attention and power. Women are fucking psychos.	The cute cashier asked for my number. I said I was married. Turns out she just wanted to look up my rewards number. She sure was embarrassed
High School Dropouts of Reddit - what would you do to solve the dropout problem facing many US school districts?	Dropout here, the fact that you see it as a problem tells me you dont want to hear what I have to say	Allow high school students to specialize in an area of interest. In my state we have some "charter" schools that do that, but mainstream high school doesn't offer much in the way of preparing for a career. By junior year, there should be some option for studying a specific set of subjects that lead to the career you are interested in pursuing.
Teachers of reddit, did you ever find out a student had a crush on you?	I'm a college student who mentored in a 7th grade reading class for a quarter. On the first day, I was introducing myself to the class, and mid sentence one of the students yelled "what a milf!" ...it was really awkward after that.	I haven't yet been a full-blown teacher, but I TA'd an introductory neuroscience class where I lectured and handled tests and stuff. One girl was clearly crushing on me pretty hard, but she took it well into creeper-land when she left her used panties and a note in my mailbox in the lab where I work.
What image or scene from a children's movie/show did you find disturbing?	Not 100% if "Don't hug me, I'm scared" is a children's show but, if so, all of that. Shit is disturbing.	There was a scene in Rugrats that I don't remember too well, but tommy has a dream about this older, bigger baby that bullied him (?) and was about to eat tommy or something. I just remember being scared to death of that scene as a little kid Edit: rugrats is messed up. The "I'm not stu" scene, dust bunny, the monster bed, tommy ripping his leg and stuffing coming out...
[Serious] Men of Reddit, what was the last thing that actually caused you to cry?	Okay, I'm a lady but I don't cry. I cried the other day because the 49ers website put 2 new videos out, one was a thank you video for frank Gore and the other one was for Patrick Willis. Two of these wonderful guys left my team and I couldn't handle it	Last time I cried was about 5-6 years ago I think. My mom came into my room and told me that she had been diagnosed with breastcancer. I've always been close with my mom, so I took it pretty hard. We had a couple of difficult years after that, but she recovered and is now doing better than ever!
What's your, "I got drunk and made an ass of myself," story?	I can drink a lot because my family are all heavy drinker and my sister drink beer since she was 3 years old. So when I was 18 I thought is time to try testing my self. Went to a party in a bar on Christmas Eve and drink 12-14 bottle of beer and 2 bottle of whiskey. Completely drunk and have 0 memory afterwards. Next day morning I call my friend and he told me I was nearly dead because I tried to kiss a girl who her boy friend is a gang member and would definitely shoot me if he saw me kissing his girlfriend. Luckily he was in toilet at that moment or else I would be dead	Was so drunk I couldn't talk. Tried talking to to someone in the bathroom of the bar, they thought I was making sexual advances and the bouncer kicked me out
Women: How did having a son change your perspective on men?	Very stark contrast to the other thread. Fathers having daughters haven't had their opinions changed - girls are just as sweet as ever. Mothers having sons on the other hand - men aren't the sadistic pigs you once thought they were.	It didn't. I've always loved men. Sure, there are a lot of douchebag men out there, but the ones that are good are very, very good and there are more of those than people think because they are often the quiet ones who don't grandstand.
Reddit, What are the best psychological tricks that you know?	I like to build people's hopes by telling them good news and they usually reply, "really, that's great!" When I know they've fallen for the lie, I reply, "no, I'm just kidding" It works best when you tell them something you know they want to hear. Watching that moment of joy turn to "you're an asshole" can be rewarding. It's not that great of a psychological trick but it's fun nonetheless.	A combination of honesty and praise. It's a trick that I have to use from time to time with my plumbers. One of our buildings is really old, things weren't built right to start with and previous owners didn't fix things right either and once in a while we have the opportunity or need to fix some of it. I've walked into a job site with a dozen plumbers covered, quite literally, in mud and shit and they'll say something like, "this is killing us", and I just reply with, "If this were easy, I would have called someone else." I acknowledge that I know what I've asked them to do is hard but that I think they're the only ones capable of doing the work. As soon as I say it, they just nod and get back to work.
What was ruined because it became popular?	The joke about how funny it would be if a reality show star who was also a misogynistic, narcissistic, racist, homophobic, sexual predator, actually became president of the United States	Most subreddits get ruined when they become really popular. My favourite subreddits definitely have under 100k, there’s more of a sense of community I feel like the content is higher quality as well.
If a police officer becomes aggressive or starts to attack you physically.. What should you do?	Don't be black in the south. Edit: I guess the people downvoting expected something different in a thread without a serious tag...	Fetal position and be absolutely silent. Take the ass kicking and get a lawyer. Do not say a single word to anyone until you are booked, then only tell them your name and that you will not speak without an attorney present.
What non-sexual clothing item immediately turns you on?	Nice heels, not those awful stripper monstrosities with huge plateaus but classy heels like loboutin or mblahnik. You know what i mean ladies	Work clothes. Better if she's wearing a tight skirt and a ponytail. And high heels (doesn't matter if she's taller than me).
What's an unwritten requirement for your job that you won't see on a job description?	Every job - you will face a lot of shit. If you want to grow, dont just deal with it. Make the most of it!!	Must provide free legal advice that you are not qualified to give and have no time to research because the general public expects you to.
College Students of Reddit, what's The most overrated piece of advice you were given?	That I need a college degree to be successful. I dropped out two years in and started following my passion. Now, 3 years later, I'm much happier, less in debt, and I wake up every morning knowing I'm doing what my heart is telling me to do. Edit: to anyone who is in college and hates it, or who is in high school and isn't looking forward to more schooling, check out Praxis. Discoverpraxis.com. It's a 9 month program, 3 months of professional and personal development training and then 6 months of an apprenticeship at a startup or nonprofit. You don't need a degree to get ahead, you just need the raw drive. I've had a few friends do the program and they all unanimously say that it was the best decision they've ever made. Check it out. Discoverpraxis.com	For every hour you're in class, spend 3 studying. Not practical unless you are taking few classes OR are able to piss freetime outside of your school schedule.
People who work in hotels, what are some the scariest, unexplainable, and/or creepiest things that you have experienced while working?	This dude came up to me and asked for jumper wires. Thinking that his car battery has died, I got him some. He then proceeded to beat the shit out of his son for not using a serious tag.	Got into a lift from the top floor to head down. Lift stopped at 4th floor, door opened, saw people outside standing still, making no attempt to come in despite me being alone inside and there was room for them. The automatic lift door then closed and before it was completely shut, I heard someone outside said "Why is the lift so full of people?". FML
What annoying medical problem do you have that is too insignificant to go see a doctor for, but really gets on your nerves?	I should point out that while this thread is perfectly fine, people offering medical advice is not. The thread can stay up, but if you see people offering medical advice please report the comments. If too many happen, the thread may have to be removed. EDIT: just to be clear, medical advice constitutes you telling people what it could be, and also could *not* be. So if someone says "I get crushing headaches that last for a split second then vanish" and you reply with "that sounds like cluster headaches" *or* "everyone gets those, you're perfectly fine" then it's not allowed.	I can't yawn. I'll get the urge, inhale nice and deep, and nothing happens - that beautiful, muscle shaking release never happens, and it always feels like "I can't get the yawn out". I used to be able to yawn, when I was a kid. I've gotten used to it but it's so stressful. I bet you're yawning right now, you bastard.. Edit: Holy shit, thanks for the Gold! And thanks to the people who have been offering some possible solutions - I didn't even know there were other poor souls like me.. I've been laughing all day reading everyone's battle against yawning while reading my comment, but just so you all know, I haven't been able to yawn, despite all of the wonderful triggers..however, my eyes sure are watering. Lol, there is no relief!
What's your non-sexual "fetish" and why?	I judge women by their eyebrows. Small thin line eyebrows lose. If you draw on your eyebrows, just stay home.	When camping, the sound of rain on falling on the tent as I try to go to sleep is something I absolutely live for.
What are your unpopular movie opinions?	I hate Lord of the Rings. I've never seen Harry Potter. Game of Thrones is retarded. I despise digital filmmaking and most CGI. I don't like remakes very much or comic book movies either. I also don't like juvenile literature or any of the films made based upon juvenile literature. Most actors today suck. They might be pretty faces, but that's it. Pretty much I like 1/100 movies made today, and they usually involve an older director and/or older actors. Basically, I think the state of cinema is in the sewer. Edit: One needs only to watch Bergman, Tarkovsky, Ozu, Kobayashi, or Cassavetes, etc., to see the sorry state filmmaking is in. Edit 2: Hey, OP asked for unpopular movie opinions. I was just obliging him.	Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl is a fantastic movie, and quite possibly the best I've ever seen. Everyone says "eh it was ok/good" but I love that movie. It has beautiful scenery, hilarious dialogue, action sequences, great characters, and all without being forced at all (like the sequels were). I love that movie
how old are you in your first memory?	It was shortly after being delivered. The doctors cut off part of my penis, and it hurt so bad I couldn't walk for damn near a year.	I have no clue. I don't know which of my memories are the true ones, or the stories I have told about them. I know for a fact some of my memories are just stories I have told.
Professors of Reddit, what were the worst papers that you had to grade?	Abnormal Child Psychology: I wrote a paper on the anti-depressant qualities of semen and its effects on teen girls. I asserted if we encouraged girls to give blow jobs, this could pack a nice one-two punch of curbing teen pregnancy and teen depression.	In my AP Literature course, I was grading a paper from a student for whom a C- would be an achievement. The first paragraph is fantastic. I'm impressed. The second paragraph, awful. The third is again written eloquently, the fourth is atrocious. I call the student to my desk after class, set his paper between us, and tell him I haven't Googled anything yet. But if he'd like to tell me anything about the paper before I did, this was his opportunity. "Yeah I plagiarized a lot of it." Alright then.
What’s your “And everyone clapped” moment that actually happened?	Camp Counselor to me: Just because you're big doesn't make you special. Me to Canp Counselor: Yeah. Because taking care of us to put yourself through community college is really something. ... the 12 year olds liked that one	Mr husband proposed in a busy restaurant. People clapped. Champagne was on the house. Edit. I see my typo, but I like it and I think I'm gonna leave it.
What is the most annoying thing when you are having a meal in a restaurant?	When you come in a half hour before closing and you can feel the butthurt coming off the staff because they actually have to do their jobs during the time they say they are open.	When you're seated anywhere near the entrance and people who are waiting for their own tables are standing right on top of you.
Parents of Reddit, what's your best or worst "I taught my kid that" moment?	Driving down the street in my Truck Beautiful summer day 3 yr old son says "Hello Nurse" I turn my head. Yes he is correct, fist bump.	2 year old in the back of the car. Girl can barely talk, but we're waiting in traffic and out of the blue she yells, "come on dude, move!"
Reddit, what is the fastest way you've seen a room full of happy people turn real ugly and sour. What happened?	I mixed up all this fake puke at home and then I went to this movie theater, hid the puke in my jacket, climbed up to the balcony and then, t-t-then, I made a noise like this: hua-hua-hua-huaaaaaaa - and then I dumped it over the side, all over the people in the audience. And then, this was horrible, all the people started getting sick and throwing up all over each other. And I never felt so bad in my entire life!	when it was announced our community bank was being acquired by wells fargo and ~85% of people were going to lose their jobs. edit: the announcement was made during the end of year manager's meeting where bonuses, Christmas party festivities, etc. were discussed. no bonuses, no Christmas party, most people just got severance for the holidays
What is the best psychological trick you can do to someone reading this thread?	Pick a number from 1-100. Add 5. Subtract 2. Add 6. Multiply by 2. Divide by 2. Subtract 3. Add 6. Add 18. Subtract 3. Subtract your original number. Add 11. Multiply by 2. Divide by 2. Multiply by 2 again. Add 13. Add 7. Subtract 12. Subtract 15. Your number is [69](/s).	You are now aware that your lower jaw has weight, and that it requires effort for you to hold it up.
What is positive and negative about your job that no one considers while applying for it?	Positive. My boss & co workers are really nice. Negative. It can get real disorganized, real quick - making it stressful and a bit of a shit show.	Social media for a major sports broadcaster. Pro: Get to attend a lot of cool live sporting events and be right on the sidelines. Con: Your job follows you wherever you go, 24/7, because social media never stops. Also have to consistently read through some dishearteningly idiotic post comments on a daily basis. Edit: Spelling
Teachers of Reddit, what was the biggest student meltdown you ever witnessed?	Not a teacher but I once sat next to the fat weird kid in my class that no one liked. He asked me for a pencil once and I didn't have one so I said no. He then broke down and started crying and mumbling about how every one hates him and wants him to get hit by a bus. The teacher had to kick him out of the class because he was crying so loud.	I had a first grader that was hot (we did not have air conditioning), so he stood up, knocking over his chair. That wasn't enough so he threw the chair then walked to my desk and cleared it off with a swipe of his arm. After that, he pushed the intercom button calling the office and before they could answer he stepped into the hall to sit down to wait for the principal. Once the principal arrived to take him to the air conditioned office, the student bit the principal on the arm (we heard the hollering as we were trying to clean up). He was suspended for 3 days and got to stay home in his air conditioned apartment.
What does the inside of your mind look like?	Turning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity.	It has like 50 tabs of stuff open *AND I CANT FIND THE ONE WITH THE GODAMNED SONG ON REPEAT*
People of Reddit who have straight up walk out on a job, what was your breaking point?	i was waiting tables and my boss told me to go roll silverware in the empty banquet room. after about ten minutes, the muzak version of Get Up Stand Up came on. and that was it. i left for lunch and never went back.	Mild and boring: I was working an incoming call-center job selling electronics. I walked into work one day, put my headset on, put my finger on the button to take a call, then took my headset off. I walked into my manager's cubicle and said "I really don't want to work here anymore. This is really boring." He said "I feel you, I don't like it either." I said "do you want me to put in two weeks notice?" He said "nah, just bail out of here and get a drink." We shook hands. He quit a week later.
Oh look at that. 1,000,000 subscribers. What's your most useful piece of advice you've received from r/AskReddit?	The number of subscribers means nothing for the subreddits on the home page. It is defaulted for every new account.	If I ever have a serious skull injury, I should post about it on reddit first AND THEN get myself to a hospital.
If animals can speak and swear, which animal do you think would swear the most?	I was going to say dogs, but dogs are probably too stoopid - happy but stoopid. I'd also have to go with cats.	> Fish are always eating other fish. If fish could scream, the ocean would be loud as shit. You would not want to submerge your head, nothing but fish going "Ahhh, fuck! I thought I looked like that rock!" \- Mitch Hedberg
What brands are considered top of the line but aren't? What are the actual top of the line brands?	Apple. They have zero compatibility with almost anything else. Specialised "lightning" port on the iPhone and iPad, printer compatibility (Apple Air-Print enabled), so much stuff you can run it only on Apple. Everything is overpriced a.f. as a result. About the only saving grace is the fact that you can run the Windows *operating system* on a Mac, and that iPhone is *vastly* superior to Windows phone. Edit 1: Oh yeah. Logic Pro. Edit 2: > Windows phone I know, right? **It was an** ***absolute failure.*** Edit 3: I just don't like *this* aspect of Apple.	Rule of thumb: If there's a Kirkland Signature alternative, buy that. Their socks, underwear, blankets, shirts, packaged foods, everything I've bought from them (Costco's in house brand) has been better than any name brand and cheaper. It's like they do market research, make their product about 20% more robust, and then sell it for 50% of the competition price.
Dear Reddit, what did you recently discover?	Gaming on PC is much better than console, playing all my old console games on PC aswell as inside games that aren't available on console, control scheme is literally a billion times better, so customisable etc etc So much more freedom! My Xbox 360 is now in a drawer under my bed...	It's called a cupboard because you put cups on a board EDIT: ITS CALLED A WARDROBE BECAUSE ITS A WARD FOR ROBES FUCK
What is the scariest thing you have ever experienced?	I was camping last week and saw this guy buttfucking another guy at the campsite next to us in front of the campfire.	Sitting in a hospital room with my pregnant wife who was five weeks away from her due date and a nurse came in to tell her she had HELLP Syndrome. I’m the corner of the room I Google it like an idiot and read that 25% of the time the mother, the child, or both don’t survive the pregnancy and the only cure is immediate delivery. It only took like 30 minutes, but the pacing and waiting was fucking terrifying. A 75% chance of things going well never felt so slim.
What's your "Don't judge me" thing?	I talk in 3rd person sometimes. It started in highschool and a way to irritate a teacher and it continues into my mid twenties	Responding to my cats' meows with questions, which prompts more meows. They seem to enjoy it as much as I do.
What was your "dodged a bullet" moment?	A mentally(disabled/ill) girl was hitting on me when I was in year 2 and she was like 3 years older than me no offence to her but she was ugly as shit and super creepy just glad she left that year	Almost got my 17 year old girlfriend pregnant when I was 16. We both wanted it. In hindsight that would have been a *massive fucking mistake*.
[Serious] Chain restaurant employees, what should customers not order from your menu?	I used to work at Chipotle and never ever ever ever ever order a double wrapped quesarito. It hold up the long ass line that the workers want to get through. The workers will hate you, the people in line will hate you, even your born and unborn children will hate you.	Used to work at Burger King. Don't order grilled chicken or veggie burgers. No one orders them, so they sit for hours (literally) and they become horrible dried out garbage. Also avoid the crispy chicken and fish because they tend to sit around for a while too. EDIT: Since apparently i'm ruining veggie burgers for people, just ask for it made fresh and don't come through the drive thru. The only thing BK management cares about is drive thru times. Come in to the store, ask for it (or anything) made fresh and 99% of the time they'll do it.
What is a bigger threat than people realize?	Eating meat. Sounds absurd, but it contributes to ~15% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Has a tragically low yield relative to other protein sources, and requires an incredibly high investment of land, feed, and water. One hamburger can take up to 660 gallons of fresh water to create. Many lesser developed countries also develop for livestock on rainforests. Long story short, eating meat is unsustainable as the population grows and bad for the environment. To live sustainably, in the next 100 years we have to change our approach to relying too heavily of livestock. It should be considered a luxury, not an everyday right. 200 years ago, it was more than stable, but not today.	Antibiotic resistance. I'm an epidemiologist, and this shit terrifies me. We have abused these drugs for decades, and continue to abuse them. Docs give these things out like candy, you can even get them OTC in lots of other countries, and people take them for all sorts of illnesses that aren't even caused by bacteria.
mistresses of reddit - Why do you do it?	this whole thread = a bunch of sluts telling storys about how big of a slut they are, while acting like theyre the victim. this is by far the most annoying thread ive ever seen on reddit. edit : you can downvote me all you want, doesnt change facts. this thread is a disgusting meeting of daddy issues, selfishness, and general blame shifting. the lack of responsibility in these storys are fucking disgraceful	Well, I met the mistress once, and we had a nice chat about how she felt superior to me whenever he would rather have her than me, but said she didn't want to hurt me anymore (I had been suspecting and there were fights) so that's why she came clean. They are now going strong and I am sitting here kicking flowers. Edit: Wow, I did not expect all of this sympathy. Thanks, all of you, but it's a learning experience, you know? And yes, I will be kicking the flowers on their graves. Bitterness till the end!
Computer whiz's of Reddit, what are some simple habits I should have to keep my computer running fast?	Don't download stuff from just anywhere online. My personal rule is unless I pay for it I'm not downloading music or movies.	Always choose "custom installation" when installing software, and make sure you only install what you want. Programs often come with unnecessary crap bundled in if you don't opt out.
What kind of people do you hate the most?	Hot heads, entitled individuals, and feminist that essentially lump all men into this all men are the same thing. I mean I'm all for empowering women, but talking poorly of anyone to make you take a step up just is not going to get anyone to take you seriously.	People who say you have no right to complain because they have had it worse. Had a rough night with little to no sleep? Don't even get me started. I haven't slept for two days because of work. Rough day at work? You're job is easy compared to mine. People literally die at my work. Like geez, we're not competing for gold in the misery olympics. We both have a right to complain even if yours might be objectively worse. No need to one-up on complaints
Customer: "You need to work on your flower beds. I just fell while walking through it and almost broke my shoulder." Me: "I'm sorry. That's why we have a sidewalk right next to it." Reddit, what's the dumbest request/demand someone's given you?	Customer: *picks up our menu from designated menu slot* "Is this your menu?" Me: "....yes...?" Customer: Okay! I was just checking!" WTFYOU'RESTUPID.	When I worked at Starbucks I mistakenly made someone an iced mocha without mocha. Obviously dumb on my part, I fixed the drink for her. She tasted it and said "No it just doesn't taste right. Make me a new one", then went to the bathroom. I was still making the new one when she got back but she saw her old drink and assumed that was it. She tasted it and said "Ahh, now that is perfect." and walked away.
Middle school teachers, what is the cringiest thing you've seen a student do?	I'm not a teacher but I'm a former student. I once saw a group of people cosplay as Harry pottervcharacters to school. A couple days later they displayed as some anime characters from something	Valentine's Day and a boy brings a girl a dozen roses. They were both in my homeroom, so I watched this all go down right in front of me. I had literally never seen these two have a conversation before, either. Girl didn't know what to do with roses at 7am so she threw the roses in the trash can literally 20 seconds after it happened and went on her merry way. The boy never found out.
Reddit, what are your wedding horror stories?	Was my wedding day. Friends of my wife ask if I want to drive around real quick and smoke a bowl. Hell yea I do! On the way back we get lost. People start noticing the groom is missing. Wife gets pissed and pulls me to another room to tell me how much. Her sisters see this and start asking questions. Should have just hit it real quick and stayed. Next time....lol	At my sister's wedding reception my Mom's cousin asked to sing, and was told firmly, no. So she got drunk, took the mic from the DJ and started singing, leaving her old-enough-to-know-better, rotten, never-disciplined child unattended, and the child ran her fingers along the wedding cake and other deserts, and then, the child got a cup of coffee and spilled it on my sisters VERY expensive french lace vintage wedding dress. They are no longer invited to family functions.
What was the dumbest thing you've seen someone do on their first day on the job?	Restaurant Worker- We would have the new people try to drain the hot water lines that come out of the coffee maker. Had a girl fill multiple buckets before giving up. Good times	Come to work on shrooms. Granted, this was a restaurant, and a good number of people who work there are under the influence of something. But he was so high from the night before (July 4th) that he freaked out and stayed in the basement for an hour. The owner found him, and luckily for the guy he just sent him home to come back another day.
What is the creepiest thing that has happened to you while on a computer?	Playing on a private game server with friends, invite only. Some guy came on, saw his avatar, then promptly logged out. No one knew who he was. Edit: To the one guy who down voted me, I apologize that my creepy experience didn't live up to your worthiness. You could've ignored my post and kept scrolling. But no. You downvoted my experience relating to the topic. Probably won't read this, to.	Once I was downloading music, then this pop up came up and took a mugshot of me from my webcam, since then I always cover my webcam.
Environmentalists of Reddit, what is something that people often do wrong with the intention of helping the environment?	Unless we come up with better ways to recycle or dispose of all these batteries we are using to charge our electric cars and store solar/wind energy... I feel we will have a different crisis on our hands in the near future.	One thing people think is environmentally friendly are those hand dryers in public restrooms. Those things use up a bunch of electricity and it would be better if we just recycle paper towels.
What is the nicest thing someone has ever said to you?	"Why are you perfect at everything!?" This was my friend's reaction to noticing some old drawings of mine while I was teaching him how to play a piece of music. It's an obvious exaggeration but when he said that I realized that some people actually notice the amount of work I've put into relatively mundane hobbies like drawing, writing, playing music etc and I really appreciated his comment. Him and my other close friends always get excited about my passions and vice versa so to tack an LPT onto this comment, if you enjoy something as much as someone in your life does then show them. They'll appreciate it.	11th grade, AP US History. I was an awkward overweight neckbeard, and didn't think anyone cared about me. We had just finished our first big group project of the year. Our teacher then hands us out slips of paper, and asks each of us to write down 3 people that we would want to work with on the next project, and she would try to make sure each of us got at least one of those people in our group. The next day, our teacher tells us that she was able to make groups that satisfied everyone. But she then said that something strange had happened with the results; "Everyone in the class wrote down the same one person on their paper, and that person . . . is OBear." How I did not cry then and there I'll never know.
For those who did NOT live together with their spouse before getting married, how was it adapting to living together full time?	Oh Lord, I am going to show this thread to my parents & make them realise that "living in sin" is the best way to determine compatability. 🙄😏	It worked well for us. We'd been dating 8 years beforehand, which was plenty of time to see and know each other's home habits. There are still little things I do that irks him, and the same goes for his habits that irk me. But, you look past the little things for the bigger picture. Even if it means you have to put up with his 400+ movie collection, and that he does laundry but always shoves it in the hamper instead of immediately folding it. ;)
Okay, Reddit, what is one fun fact about yourself?	I was hit by a metro bus. My head hit and broke the windshield of said bus. Sustained minimal injuries. No concussion. No broken bones. Price of 3-hr hospital visit: $1000 Price of broken windshield: $1200 I did more damage to the bus than it did to me. The cross country team started calling me "the boy who lived", because I resembled Harry Potter at the time.	I have begun saying this when asked to "tell us a little bit about yourself" because it's true. If you google "hiker before and after" one of the first things you'll see is me in my underpants.
Men of reddit who are in traditionally female positions (i.e. elementary teacher, nurse, SAHD), what are some of the reactions commonly associated with your profession and sex?	My male teachers were head and shoulders above 90% of my female teachers, and that goes all the way until I graduated college.	I have a male cousin who is a preschool teachers. There was a petition going around to have him fired. He sued two people for going onto his towns forum and telling the town that he is a pedophile.
What are some nonweird ways for a guy to meet girls in person?	Don’t do something “to meet girls” unless romantic exploration is the purpose of the activity (couples date/single mingle/etc). I can’t speak for all ladies, but I am so sick of not being able to do anything enriching without some fuck trying to get his dick wet out of it. If your goal is to meet someone - either for a hookup or a long-term relationship - pursue it with integrity. You will be much more likely to encounter women with the same mindset.	I started volunteering. Find something you believe in and think is important and go there to volunteer for once a week or so. You’re guaranteed to find other people who have similar values and some of them might be a similar age and some of them might be interesting.
Couples who lie about how you met, what's your real meeting story?	Met at retail job. Stole her from her boyfriend of 7 years. Told her she wasnt down to pound(Drink) Our first date we drank a 18 pack of tecate and we were still functioning. *Mr Steal yo girl*	She was my coke dealer. We bonded while I helped her bag an ounce into grams. We had some crazy and tumultuous years, but after we both straightened our lives out we decided "we met at a house party" was close enough to the truth.
People who like to spoil things for others, why are you like this?	While I try to avoid it out of respect, I would like to make people face it more often. The plot is only one part of media and it gets too much focus these days. There is also the visuals, audio, action choreography, and much much more. Also people who really care about spoilers should take more care to experience the media within a reasonable time. I think within a month of knowing the story exists should be enough time. I would encourage people to spoil the plot of a big movie before seeing it and judge if it really impacts the viewing experience.	My friend does this unintentionally all the time. He doesnt mean it, he is just super hyped about some bit of a movie and desperately wants to tell you about it so everyone can bask in the glory of how awesome that bit is, sometimes he actually ends up making the bit he tells you about better, but most of the time he just gives something important away while thinking he is being obscure enough, which he isnt (but I know he really tries, the darling). Or maybe Im just really really good at working stuff out with minute amounts of info. Id love to believe that my brain is some super awesome detective machine, but nah. &#x200B; tl:rd : My friend gets over exited and wants to share the love, its not malicious at all.
What stupid thing pisses you off a bit too much?	Entitlement. Usually wealthy people think they are excused from normal rules. Need to run into the shop but don’t want to find a spot in parking garage? Just park your Mercedes on the street. It’s just for a minute- what’s the big deal? The big deal is - why do YOU get to do that? And: Why can’t I bring my dog into the grocery store if service dogs are allowed? My dog is small and I’ll carry it even! It’s rules like this that, if more and more people have this mentality, then 10 people will be parked on the street and there will be 10 dogs in the grocery store. Not okay.	Slow walkers. You say excuse me they act like they can't hear you so you have to say it louder now you're the rude one.
To the older gym goers, at what age did you just say "f**k it" and start walking around the gym locker room completely naked?	There's a generation of us that actually took showers after practice and were comfortable with nudity. We went skinny dipping, streaked the quad, and realized a dick is just a dick. We'll die off in the coming decades and all you homophobic delicate flowers can hide your little pee-pees and be happy again.	Does drying your junk and crack with the blow dryer happen at the same age, or later? How about standing in the center of the locker room totally nude with your neck cranked up watching ESPN for like 15-20 minutes straight?
Has anyone ever had a dream so vivid it made you question reality when you woke up?	Yes. I just recently dreamed I scrolled through AskReddit and didn't see two or three versions of this question at any one time. I did immediately realize it was unrealistic tho.	I once had an incredibly vivid dream on a plane that it was crashing. Everything got louder and louder, people around me were panicking and I remember digging my nails into the arm rests. Then I woke up on that same plane and everything was fine, people around me sleeping through the flight. Kinda always taken an interest in multiple universes and stuff like that since then.
Have any doctors or nurses of reddit delivered a baby that was obviously not the father's? How'd the couple react?	This is why they teach you bout punnet squares in science class. if both parents are 100% white the child \*should\* come out white (random genetic things not counted) If one parent is white one something else. theres a 25% chance child will look 100% white, 25% look something else, or 50% chance of a mix of both traits.	My great-grandmother had three daughters. This was back when they used to fully knock out and tie down the woman giving birth, so she would get the anesthesia, go to sleep, wake up and be handed her baby, not remember any of it. My grandmother and her second daughter were born blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and blonde. The third daughter came out with a mess of black hair and dark eyes. When my great-grandmother woke up and saw her daughter she yelled at the nurse for trying to "swindle her into taking an Asian baby home." ETA: yes, women used to be put under and tied down to give birth. It was common practice for the first half of the twentieth century. It's called Twilight Sleep and yes, it was super dangerous.
People who took a year or so off before starting college, what do you learn and where did you go?	70% of students who take a year off do not go back. 90% of students who take a year off never graduate. So it's going to be tough to find a person to answer this.	I learned that 1 year turns into many years which turns into a military enlistment to pay for college. Then you go back feeling like Billy Madison.
What is the best smell?	My wife's farts. Seriously, they are so tiny and so potent, you can't not be impressed by them. I also love the fact that when she lets one go she sits quietly waiting for me to smell it or says something like "do you smell flowers/baking bread?" Which instantly makes me take a big inhale trying to smell said flowers or bread, but all I end up with is fart. I love this woman!	Coffee and freshly baked cake. The cool morning smell, preferably by a lake. Unburnt/Fresh petrol. New parchment, freshly mown grass...and something flowery you smelled at the Burrow.
What are you binge-watching this year?	I'll prepare myself for the downvotes. I binge-watched the first two seasons of Breaking Bad and then a couple episodes of season three but then I just stopped. It wasn't as compelling as I'd hoped. But I **will** finish my watch by the end of the year!	I just discovered Parks and Recreation. I'm not from the US, that's my excuse. My lack of computer literacy is what just enabled me to access US netflix. EDIT: I love the show. The characters are all so great and complement each other so well. Tom is so delightfully crass but not in a mean or off-putting way. Anne is just so freaking earnest. April is the epitome of indifference, it's like she's the office cat. And as for Ron, well he's Ron freakin' Swanson.
What are some signs that you should fuck off?	If you say, "You can't be racist against whites." Or, "America is a rape culture." Or, "Evolution has no evidence!" Or, "/r/iamversmart". The list is long and preposterous of the people who need to fuck off.	I often have coworkers that come and sit in my office to chat forever even when I don't want to. If I don't take my eyes off of the computer monitor and continue typing while you're talking to me, take the hint. In fact, it's happening right now.
Men and Women - What is the "sluttiest" thing you have ever done?	slept with all friends exes. sometimes all in the same week or day. not ashamed.had to much fun. i didnt mind being used as a easy rebound.	I ate a girl's pussy because she lived across the street from the bar and I didn't feel like walking home.
What is the most boring large city on Earth?	It is not the most boring large city but one of them, and my guess is it could be Moscow.	There are cities in Russia with over a million people, that most people have never heard of like Chelyabinsk. If you think your American city is boring, imagine that but every building is the same and its uninhabitably cold for most of the year.
What do you see on TV all the time that never actually happens in everyday life?	People who get out of bed in the morning looking fresh and made up with makeup or gelled hair. Then they kiss each other without having brushed their teeth. Ick! People who sleep in the bed with their shoes on while sober. That is so uncomfortable. After having sex they're in their underwear and don't change the sheets the next morning while conveniently covering each sex's privates. Give me a break! How can you not wash your sheets and sleep in the same bed the next day!? And please, it's okay to see women's titties! We need more titties on TV.	According to TV the world is full of people who know the exact force and angle needed to hit someone on the head and knock them unconscious for an hour without causing any serious head injury.
What sentence would you have if you tapped the middle button of your phones autocorrect 20 times?	I am going to be in the polls and I will get you the sheet music and the other is a field trip.	I just got home and I don't think I'm going to the gym today and it is not the same
What was something you thought was a myth but turned out to be true?	That blacks were inherently violent and unintelligent, thought it was racist bullshit, then I went to my first day of public school.	Met my wife in Oregon. Moved back here to Oklahoma/arkansas area, and saw a Roadrunner. She didn't know they were a real thing.
What's your crazy theory that you have no way of proving?	That transgendered people are the very, very rough and early steps of the next stage of human evolution. By that I mean a being that is both male and female. Seeing what is happening in Japan with people losing interest in sex is just a peek of what is too come for various reasons to exhaustive to write about here. There is a lot more to it of course. Enormous conversation.	There's a tall, possibly east European man that follows me to music concerts just to stand in front of me. It happens all the time and he always looks the same.
Add "2099" to any movie title to make a futuristic sequel. What happens in the movie?	Spider-Man 2099 Which is an actual comic book so basically a man named Miguel O Hara was Experimented on by a company called Alchemax which gave Spider like powers and he fights future versions of Spider-Man villains such as Green Goblin and Venom 2099 all while avoiding the Public Eye which is the police force	2001 becomes 20012099. The inhabitants of earth in 20 million years uncover another enlightening obelisk. This one explains the end of the previous movie.
Fellow workers of reddit, what is the equivalent of "spitting in their food" for your job?	Pool installer here. Tiny hole in your liner which won't leak enough for you to notice however it will make the pool wall rust and cut the life span of your pool in half.	"Your account is now set up. Your new password is l1Jsu0O$hf@7fk@lan@CXnqli1|CnahELnaFQ3. Please login and change your password as soon as possible." Send it as an image so they can't cut and paste.
People of Reddit, what do you not understand that everyone else understands?	How you can feel you're oppressed as a black person when there are actors, athletes, and a freaking president that is African American.	Directions. There are some people who just naturally know which direction they're facing. I barely know my left from my right.
Hey reddit, what is making you so happy at this point in your life?	Started my second semester at an actually University that I worked so hard to get into. I'm glad that I stuck with it to the point that I feel like there is nothing between me and a great career.	So I'm dating a single mom. Which...I guess no longer makes her a single mom? I'm not sure about how the semantics of that title work. Anyway we get along great. I love her son, and I'm pretty sure he loves me back. Anyway yesterday he had a delayed school start because of the snow, so I took the day off work and spent the morning snuggling/napping on the couch with him and watching Adventure Time. I dunno, he's just become very comfortable with me, and yesterday it hit me that he really loves me almost as much as he loves his mom. Which feels really nice.
Reddit, what did you dream about last night?	I snore so I don't dream. But when I was young (5-9) I had a recurring dream where I stole Dill Pickles slice of pizza then was chased by a dog then played fetch with it.	I dreamed that I was seducing a black chick, also I masturbated so hard that my foreskin came off. Not necessarily in that order.
What is something that takes a enormous amount of time to prepare, for a few seconds of joy that people won't ever mind doing?	Sex. All the work for an orgasm. Jerking off is 20 times better. It took me years to figure this out.	Cooking. There's something so satisfying about putting in hours of prepwork to put together a really nice meal. Focusing on not just quality of food, but plating and presentation, especially when it all works out with things that can end up poorly like poached eggs or a souffle
Non-Europeans, what is something about European culture that makes you laugh?	Embracing royalty. I get it that it's nice to play in medieval times, but actually having a king/queen/prince/ss, giving them a better treatment and tax money is fucked up.	Maybe not laugh, but I would say the "Ultra" subcultures of football fans. Stereotypical soccer fans in America could not be any more different.
Teachers of Reddit what is the juiciest gossip going on in your school right now?	My mom's a sub and she found a girl trying her hardest to seduce one of the construction workers who were putting new air conditioners. The guy believed the girl when she said she was 18. She was 15 and a huge slut.	One of the Pre-k kids told his teacher that he hates her because she's black. His mom kept him and his 2 year old sister home the rest of her week, but when they came back the next week, his sister just kept saying over and over "Andrew in BIG trouble."
Students of Reddit, what's the most creative way you've seen someone cheat on a test?	This guy in my high school printed the answers on the inside of his water bottle. He would have gotten away with it if he didn't forget the bottle in the room.	I went to a catholic high school and for theology we would have tests which we had to write our prayers on loose leaf. A kid in my grade wrote the prayer before class, crumpled it up and threw it in the trash can. The real test starts, and the kid waits for a few people to finish, writes a few things down, and then proceeds to act frustrated, crumple up his test and throw it in the trash can. The teacher told him to get it out, and that turning in something is better than nothing at all. The kid goes to the trash can and grabs the pre written prayer. Gets a 90 (left some errors to not be obvious). It was pure genius.
What is your deepest insecurity?	In the middle of all this sadness, let me say this: You are all beautiful and amazing people. Have a nice day!	I am always nervous. Every new and different situation I get into I am super nervous. I get really red and sweaty and my voice cracks. I am an adult and I thought that would be better by now. I get so caught up and trying to act normal that pretty much none of my reactions and natural. I have a very hard time communicating with people.
Where's your high school crush now?	* Last I heard she had her own show on the cooking channel. * Her name was Kelly, she was beautiful and everyone thought so. Even my best friend A.C. liked her. I had one small nerdy friend I could trust to not flirt with her, some time later I heard he ran into some money problems and did a porno. *Anyway*, Her friends Jesse and Lisa would constantly try and cock block me (I went out with them, too). I would always get into trouble trying to do cool shit to impress her, but our dumbass principal Mr. Belding would bust me. All while teaching me valuable life lessons at the same time. We parted ways when she moved to Beverly Hills and I moved to New York to become a detective. Those were the days, Gooo Bayside!	Married with kids. All of my crushes are all married with kids. And I am here...on reddit and looking at cat pictures alone.
Parents who have had their children be bullies, or reported to have been mistreating their classmate... How did you find out? And how did it make you feel? What happened after?	Parents who give enough of a shit to actually tell their story are either blind to their little demon's flaws ("not *my* little Schnookle!"), or they'd be stoked ("Hell yeah, my kid done hwooped them homos' ass! Fuckin, git'r done!")	I feel like only good parents who actually acknowledged and subsequently addressed the problem will comment here. The answer we probably won't see, despite it being very common, is "I ignored it, the other kid was the bully / deserved it"
What's your favourite quote?	"Liberals are like Slinkys ...... They serve no purpose, but it's really fun when you push one down a staircase."	“the child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth.” an african proverb
What's the most hilariously disappointing gift you've ever received (or given and it was painfully obvious that it was disappointing)?	My grandmother once bought me a set of beige bike shorts when I was in highschool as the guy at the store told her they were all the rage with the kids...I didn't have the heart to tell her they were the gayest item of clothing I'd ever seen.	Somehow there was a miscommunication for Christmas, I was given 8 hoodies total from my family. Nothing else. Just 8 hoodies
What's your best (in this case, worst) third wheel story?	Back in 5th grade my guy friend, let's call him Max and his gf were under a table talking. Then Max decided it would be a good idea to invite me to also sit with him and his gf, being bored I agreed and soon after that they were sneaking kisses with me awkwardly sitting next to them. This has also happened in a similar situation when in class the lights were out and we were sitting on the floor, Max and his gf were kissing and I was just sitting there wondering why they invited me. "Max", if you ever read this, you're not a very subtle person.	I was at some stay-away summer camp, and it was after some concert type deal. I was off hanging out with two friends, and one of their girlfriends. At some point, the dude started making out with his girlfriend, so me and my other friend decided to give them some privacy. But instead, he stopped kissing his girl, said "Hey guys, don't make it weird. Sit your asses back down." So, we sat awkwardly in silence on the bench while this dude continued to make out with his girlfriend. We stayed for another minute or so before getting up and leaving again.
What is the TLDR of your country's history?	We always choose bad allies, and sometimes we are the bad guys, but some of us refuse this and wish to see themselves as victims. We like to look down our neighbours because of our 1100 years long history, but we are the most corrupt, uneducated and hateful country in the region.	FRANCE: This land is mine NATIVES: This land is ours FRANCE: Nope ENGLAND: This land is mine FRANCE: This land is ours ENGLAND: Nope AMERICA: This land should be ours ENGLAND: Nope
Redditors who have lived in different parts of the US, what are the biggest differences in terms of how people act?	People on the East Coast think they're hot shit. People on the West Coast are pseudo-intellectuals who pretend to be progressive in order to impress their friends. People in the South are the friendliest and most welcoming.	I'm from the Midwest, but lived in Texas (Rio Grande Valley) for a few years. One of the biggest things I noticed was how much emphasis they placed on meals. I tend to skip meals at work, and my coworkers would frequently be confused by it. They'd ask if I'd forgotten my lunch or needed money and were very generous about it, just didn't seem to understand that I skipped lunch sometimes.
What is more expensive than it should be?	ITT: Wonderful examples of people who do not understand anything at all about economics. And are answering the question, "What do you want to pay less for?"	TI-84 calculator. The technology is really old. Its not a new piece of equipment, its just necessary so its ridiculously pricy
What was the most cringiest thing you've said or done that's haunted you for years?	When I was a sophomore in high school, I had a girlfriend who wanted to use this hookah pen. Not a cigarette, or weed, or even a real hookah, just a small disposable water vapor pen that tasted like green apple. I got so furious that she was smoking, we got into such a huge fight. I didn't realize how ridiculous I was being until after we broke up and I started smoking weed. Now about 4 years later as a stoner, I look back and cringe that I could allow myself to get so mad over something so petty. I guess thats what growing up is for though	I was working in a Pharmaceutical and was in a storage area and inadvertently picked up a canteen/cafeteria intercom mic. After a few minutes of saying random shit like "Hi I'm Johnny Cash" and "You talking to me", a colleague rescued me. The canteen/cafeteria had 100+ people in it. Edit: Added /cafeteria
Redditors born on Feb 29th. How/when do you celebrate your birthday and are there any little annoyances that come along with it?	I believe that if you're born Midnight of the 29th to noon means your legal birthdate is Feb. 28th. After noon to midnight means your legal birthdate is the 1st of March	It it always a good talking point. I have mine on the 1st March on years there is no 29th. A big positive is no one forgets your birthday. Sometimes automated systems get a bit confused when I enter my birthday but it is very rare. Edit: Unlike seemingly all the other 29ers here I don't mind people calling me by my leap age or making jokes about it. While it's normal for me I get that it's unusual for most people.
Why is it that when Michael Vick abuses an animal, people go crazy; however, when Chris Brown beats a human being, nobody seems to care?	He was shunned at first, but Rihanna didn't make as big of a deal of it as you are. They've been spotted recently going out together to clubs. It's blown over and even the victim has recovered. What's your beef?	In both cases, there was a big uproar when it first happened. Now nobody really cares. Vick is playing ball again and is frequently praised by various sports news outlets. Still think they're both kind of assholes, but the general public doesn't always see it that way.
A roommate of mine just had his girlfriend move into our house and thinks the two of them can just split his share of the rent. What's the best way to talk about money with friends without destroying the friendship???	you rent out a ROOM, they pay rent for that ROOM, they split t however they like, in relation to everything else, bills, cleaning, sharing shit, everyone gets involved and you share the responsibility. But when you look in the paper to rent a room, you dont have two prices, you have a price for a room.	The best way is to be up front about it. Prepare your thoughts and give him time to respond. Don't be overly confrontational. Say "hey, so it's fair that you should pay a reduced amount as you are sharing a room, but it's not fair on us that you both collectively don't pay more as you are making full use of the shared spaces. Why don't you guys pay 150% of a single persons rent? That way you guys are still saving money but it's also fair on us since you are also making use of the shared spaces. Why don't we arrange a time to talk about this properly tomorrow?" Fentunfont's guide to not letting money become a problem with friends: deal with with it before it's a problem.
Using only popular references, what is your favorite show/movie?	Favorite shows: "Bazinga!" "It needs to be about 20% cooler." "This whole evening is roo-eeened!" "What's up, Doc?" Favorite movies: "Leave the gun. Take the cannolli." "Meg's gravy is famous; it's practically a food group." "They're here!" "Answer me, Sen!"	Just give me all the bacon and eggs you have. Wait, wait. I'm worried what you just heard was, "Give me a lot of bacon and eggs." What I said was, "Give me all the bacon and eggs you have". Do you understand?
What's it like to live right on the border of a time zone? Does this cause any problems?	The sun would rise and set up to approximately 59 minutes earlier or later than the other side of the time zone, depending on how that particular time zone is set up, that's about it.	My Aunt and Uncle live on the time zone border between East and Central. Their property line is Alabama, and they live atop Lookout Mountain in Georgia. Since they're on top of the mountain, cell/satellite signals are spotty at best. At one end of the house, it'll grab a cell tower in Georgia, and you're in Eastern time. Other side of the house, you move back an hour. This proved fun when we were in our teens, and "nights and weekends free" was a big deal to cell providers. Want to call your friends and not have to pay for it? Everyone huddle in the computer room!
What are you giving up for Lent?	ITT: Atheists showing why their agenda will always fail because they can't act like adults. Edit - Keep proving me right with downvotes and deflections. Too easy.	Smoking I started smoking at 19 and I'm almost 25. I "officially" quit 5 days ago but I'm going to go cold turkey for lent.
[Serious] Anyone who has lost a lot of weight and/or gone from couch potato to fit and healthy, what are your best tips to get into healthy diet and exercise habits?	Step 1: Cut out sugar. All of it. Even the sugar hiding in places you don't expect. After a few days of withdrawing, you will be amazed at how good you feel and how much energy you have. Step 2: Find some simple exercises that you can do anywhere and start small with just one or maybe two of them. For me it was push ups. You can do them anywhere and it only takes a minute. Step 3: Once you have gotten used to eating healthier and doing some exercises, it'll be much easier to add more exercises and you can work your way into a full blown workout routine.	Lost about 100 lbs here. There is going to be a period of a few days after your initial YEAH MAN I'M HEALTHY that you lose motivation and you start to panic and realize this is your *entire* life you're changing. During those few days you really need to stick to your routine. This is the time most lose motivation and interest. During this time absolutely say no to going out, no to snacks and no to fast foods. After this period passes you then form the 'habit' people talk about where it becomes routine.
What's the point of posting comment on 1000+ comment post?	Comments now numbering 1000+ and as my very first comment I figured why the hell not.. I'M DOING SOMETHING ORIGINAL AND UNIQUE! LOVE ME DAMNIT!	Sometimes I read through the new posts instead of the best posts. A lot of the high rated ones are just one liners that while funny don't really progress the discussion. Depends on the post content though.
Redditors who are at the World Cup, is Brazil as bad as Reddit predicted?	What do you mean 'as reddit predicted'? It's like you're implying reddit as a community knows more than other news sources.	This should have a (serious) but my brother is at the World Cup, and he has no service so he hasn't contacted anyone except for one call to my family. He said he was goin to a brothel.
Employers of Reddit, what is the strangest reason you've had to fire someone?	This young woman I hired had bulimia. Everyday she would eat really bad food(e.g. chicken wings from 7-11) and she would puke in the staff restroom. I didn't give a shit about her eating disorder really but the problem was that she wouldn't clean up the trace of her explosive stinky vomit well. Every day there would be vomit traces in the sink and all over the rim of the toilet and it stunk. I had to bring her in my office and told her to show some courtesy by cleaning up her mess after vomiting. She pretended like she wasn't the one puking. She couldn't do this. Finally after a week, I gave her the boot. She asked me why she was being fired. I said, I think you know why.	My director found him sleeping under my desk one morning when he came in early. The guy was a temp and from an agency, I was given no choice in the matter. Worst part was the reason he was sleeping there was because he was saving money to rent a room... I did give him a reference and hook him up with a consulting company though.
What critically acclaimed film do you hate and why?	Kingsman: The Secret Service was bad. Just because it had exploding heads, Samuel L. Jackson saying "fuck" at lot, and anal sex doesn't make it "good."	Gravity. I know I'm not alone in thinking it was pretty boring and the ending so unrealistic it wasn't enjoyable.
If you were very rich, Which mainstream (or not) things would you do to show everyone how rich you are?	If you were very rich, ~~Which mainstream (or not) things~~ what would you do to show everyone how rich you are?	I'm buying a car that goes very fast but the kicker is I drive it 5 mph under the speed limit everywhere I go.
I'm an atheist, but I want my daughter to have the ability to choose what she believes in on her own. How can I present her the options in a fair and non-biased way?	You are her parent. It is your job to present her the truth and raise her correctly. You know religion is bullshit, yet you entertain the thought of fucking up her life with its manipulation and torment. "Hey reddit, I know draino is fucking deadly, but I think I should let my kid taste it so they get an idea how it tastes."	In middle school my parents let me "try out" all the different major religions. I went to temple a few saturdays, church a few sundays, a mosque once, stuff like that. I think that was the best thing my parents could have done.
Guys of reddit, what are some "bro code" unspoken rules that you always follow?	Even if you know he’s 100% wrong you pretend to agree with him and show sympathy when he gets dumped. “Yes, she was totally a crazy psycho and you did nothing wrong”. Then when that bro isn’t around you all quietly agree that she was totally right and he was a dumbass. It’s never spoken of again.	If you see a bro chatting up someone they're clearly interested in, you only interject if it's to make said bro look good. edit: something like "Joe has the biggest dick I've ever sucked"
Extras in blockbuster movies, what was your experience like on set?	How about extra in a total flop movie, one in which its own cast and crew walked out during the prescreening premier? Complete fun. Dressing up, being treated with food, performing for other extras (actors, singers, the like) and all around having a good time while learning how movies are made. Strongly recommend it.	I spent a year doing extra/background work in movies and TV shows. It's a very bland life style. If it's an 8 hour work day maybe 2 hours will be spent on set. The rest of the time you are sitting in the designated extras area just chilling and hanging out. On set everything is very manufactured. For instance, I was in one baseball scenes for 42 and when they say action you cheer and cheer until you hear 'cut'. It's fun the first few times but then it gets stale really quickly and they try to do whatever they can to get you excited again. Also, you run into people who are very pretentious and call themselves 'Background Artists' who "breathe life into the scene". In all it's not a bad way to make some extra money but it's a very bland thing to get into.
Reddit, what's your best "Good Guy Greg" moment?	Alright fags, listen up. Open-book exam last semester, we were allowed to bring one sheet of paper to put all the info we needed on. Slacker in class sat next to me. Slacker in class didn't bring shit. We start the simple exam and as I'm half-way through tearing that shit up, I notice that slacker hasn't written down shit since we've started. I kick it right the fuck into super saiyan mode and slap that bitch around until I'm done in 25 seconds flat. Slide the cheat sheet over to slacker as I'm getting up to hand in the exam, walk past him at the exit where we were sitting, slightest headnod you will ever see came out of that guy. I saved his ass that day and couldn't give two fucks of a corncob, I've never said a word to him before either.	I try to be a generous person as often as possible, but perhaps my proudest moment was helping a lost kid find his parents at Los Angeles International Airport.
What passes do attractive people get in life?	Models get paid to stand around and do nothing. They say it's, "Hard work," shimmying into clothes that don't fit. Hard work that they get admired for nothing but their looks. (Man so hard) On the same token, there are tons of people like me that just dislike them because we feel they're receiving handouts their whole life. People who will have a secure future because they were pretty while people like me had to work my entire life. That's probably a bit frustrating. Anyhoo... whatever, I got some nintendo to play and I really should stop bitching because that doesn't help. HAHAHA someone told me that the job was hard because THEY STAND IN WEATHER FOR A LONG TIME. So Hard..... omg, I guess those pussies doing construction don't know shit.	The halo effect. If people view one trait of yours (e.g, beauty) positively, that tends to bleed over to how they interpret your other traits.
Reddit, what is a 2 line horror story that is actually scary as fuck?	Based on something I've read on Reddit a few times: A father tucks his son into bed, who asks "Can you check under the bed for monsters?" The father smiles, gets on his knees, and looks under the bed, only to find another child identical to his son who whispers "Daddy, I think there's someone in my bed."	My favorite is the one by Saladin Ahmed > When I was 9, the birds stopped still in the sky and I saw the men that move between moments. They sang silently as they prepared the lake where my little sister was about to drown.
So what's your best "This cop saved my ass" story?	I was going 80 in a 55 and "this cop saved my ass" from a ticket. Just told me to slow it down.	i was running and rolled my ankle with 4 miles to go to get back home. Cop who was sitting around waiting for people to speed saw me go down. He drove up to me asked me if i was ok. I told him what happened and where i was going. He drove me home so i didnt have to limp and helped me stretch out my ankle so i could walk again without a limp
[Serious] Family members of a murderer, do you still love that family member?	My cousin killed some guy in 2005. He was sent to prison and all that jazz. Of course I still love him. I regret his actions and I feel for the family of his victim that will *never* get to see their loved one again, yeah, but I still love him.	I remember back when I was 5-6 years old my grandfather would always joke about burying us under a lemon tree out the back of his house, he passed away when I was 19 and we did some renovations/yard tidy up. When we were removing the lemon tree we found bones. The police were called and found 4 bodies which they believe to be from the early 1940's and all children. Do I still love him? Yeah, to me he was always a kind gentle old man; but it does kind of scare me to think of what he was capable of.
What's the most simple thing you've ever had to explain to a fully competent adult?	That if people getting shot is a problem, the solution is not giving more people guns to "defend themselves" instead of taking them away. Seriously people.	She refused to understand why her electric bill was higher in the winter. "That doesn't make any sense, you're an idiot, I told you I NEVER TURNED THE THERMOSTAT UP! Jesus, would you listen?!" "Ma'am, I understand that you did not turn the thermostat up, but it gets colder outside in the winter." "I know it gets colder in the winter, you smartass!" "When it's colder outside, your furnace has to work harder to maintain the same temperature in your house. That uses more electricity, so your bill is higher." "But it shouldn't use any more electricity, I never turned the heat up! Why aren't you listening to me?!"
I accidentally ruined a pregnancy announcement for complete strangers then, months later, was told I was responsible for their best story of their life. What are your most awkward stories turned awesome?	they sound like a bunch of squares if thats the best story of their lives. i bet dollars to donuts the conception story was better. *drops mic, leaves to standing ovation.*	Played coed soccer when i was 10. Collided with girl and broke her arm in an accident. She had a piano duet the next week. Felt horrible. Turns out her partner also broke her other arm. They ended up playing their recital together on the same bench.
Doctors/nurses of Reddit; What is the most obvious case of a patient 'faking it' you have ever seen?	In military i went to er complaining i couldnt breathe. They said i was imagining it and made me leave. That night i suffered from 2 collapsed lungs and flatlined. They were in process of pronouncing me deceased when my heartbeat came back. Spent 2 weeks in a coma and then got a medical discharge. I now suffer from extreme dry pleurisy for the last 9 years. Still fighting to get benefits. Keep getting denied	I work as a nurse in the ER. A woman with a shaved head came in telling us she had leukemia was In serious pain. She kept saying that she needed painkillers. There were no records indicating she even had cancer and when we did a complete blood count it showed that she was in fact healthy. After that we discharged her and notified police. A few weeks later I saw her on my states most wanted list for using ID fraud at pharmacies in 20 different counties.... oxy is one hell of a drug.
Waiters/waitresses of Reddit: what is the weirdest conversation you overheard while waiting a table?	...'Why are they all standing here'..'they can see my thong'.. A couple at one of my tables, on a Sunday morning. She was wearing skin tight yellow pants, with a black thong underneath, and she wasn't hard to look at. She sounded like she was doing it purposefully.	While working as a barista, I overheard a 15 year old girl tell her friend, "God my brother is old! He's turning 25. In 5 years, he'll be 30, that's almost 40." I was 27 at the time. I died a little inside. (I'm 32 now.)
What's the most useful app you have on your smartphone?	Definitely uTorrent. Friends all scramble to find links to download potentially hazardous files from shotty sites. I just find the magnet file(s) and it's done in a few minutes.	Duolingo. When I am bored and I can't get to a computer, it is a great way to study languages.
What is the most fucked up thing you have ever seen or heard of done to a prospective groom or bride at a bachelor/bachelorette party?	I don't understand the point of these. If you feel the need to go all out the night before you get married, you should not be getting married. Grow the fuck up.	My dad got into a warrior's style street brawl at his bachelor party. Basically, they were at a strip club or something and when they walked out they saw a group of people beating the shit out of some guy on the sidewalk. My uncle went over and tried to get them to stop. Now, everybody who was present has a different version of how this thing started, and who kicked the most ass, but one thing is certain: About 30 people began beating the everliving shit out of each other in front of a strip club. My former wrestler uncle is currently infamous for kicking a man in the face with full force and knocking him out cold. In my dad's wedding pictures all of them are wearing sunglasses to cover up the black eyes.
What violated your "willing suspension of disbelief" in a movie?	Just recently with Black Panther. When those terribly rendered CGI armored rhinos came into play during the last battle I was just *yanked* from the movie so fast it was like I was a fish on a line. 1) They were God Awful to look at. 2) The entire concept was so ridiculous I nearly laughed aloud.	Pretty much any movie where they break a guy's neck like it's a piece of celery. The old Star Trek is corny but at least Spock's nerve pinch makes sense within the Star Trek rules. In the new Star Trek TV show there's humans breaking Klingon warriors' necks like they're popsicle sticks.
Who is a fictional character who is depicted as good but who's actually shitty?	Jesus. Follow ME and dump your family! Women who divorce and EVER re-marry are SLUTS! Fucking tree! Not bearing fruit out of season? DIE!!!	Glinda. She manipulates Dorothy into feeling guilt over a death she had absolutely no control over, then sends her off to fight a war she has no part of, all while conveniently ignoring the fact that Dorothy had the means to go home from the very beginning.
What do a lot of parents do to screw up their child?	Limit them with gender stereotypes. Not letting them wear things they want to wear or play with things they want to play with or have certain interests because that's a "boy/girl thing".	Not listen to them and instead talk down to them. It provides them with little confidence when standing their ground against other people.
Is it true that Americans get a measly 2 weeks annual leave? If true, how does this affect the nation?	Jesus Christ. Reddit is full of the biggest fucking pussies ever. Want 2 months off? Have fun turning into Greece. The hivemind comprises of the most unappreciative lazy assholes to ever grace this planet.	There is no standard for leave in America (unless you are in the military in which case it's 30 days a year and caps at 90 days saved). Many jobs offer no vacation. Hell, some jobs pay you to *not* take vacation. EDIT: I've been told that the military caps leave at 60 days now. My experience was from ~15 years ago.
Where's the worst place you've thrown up?	The worst thing I ever done: I mixed up all this fake puke at home and then I went to this movie theater, hid the puke in my jacket, climbed up to the balcony and then, t-t-then, I made a noise like this: hua-hua-hua-huaaaaaaa and then I dumped it over the side, all over the people in the audience. And then, this was horrible, all the people started getting sick and throwing up all over each other. And I never felt so bad in my entire life! ;)	On stage during a play. Thankfully my character was being tortured, interrogated, and beaten, so I just worked it into the show. Since I made it to a trash can, many audience members just thought it was staged. Nope. There were 4 Krystal burgers that made their theatrical debut.
One of my favorite acts of random kindness is paying for the order behind me in drive thru- what's your favorite little random act of kindness?	I'm really hoping a girl posts saying she wears short skirts/dresses and grows her hair long because she knows it brightens many men's lives around her...	Every Thursday I take a backpack of socks, mittens, and granola bars and walk around the downtown park handing them out to homeless people. If they are interested in conversing, I sit next to them and talk for a while.
What's a story you've been waiting to tell but no one ever asks it on r/askreddit?	at my skate park a while back in summer there was the autistic kid w/scooter i was sketched about it but walked it off. the next day him and all of his autistic friends with scooters (about 10 friends) and they told me to fuck of and go jack my friends off in the parking lot (i had 1 friend with me at the time) when i asked them to move because one yelled scoot train and they all followed with this train of pure autism across the entire bowl for 30 mins basically letting me do nothing. and if that's not bad enough they were all salty 10 or 11 yo kids with their 500$ scooters while their F***ING PARENTS WATCHED (to clarify I skateboard)	I was at a festival and saw a guy hula hooping. An hour later still hooping. And still an hour later. I went over to him and grabbed the hoop - he was off his bonce on LSD and couldn't stop. He was exhausted. So I stopped a man hula hooping himself to death.
Which is the most interesting fact you know about the human body?	If you were born with a penis you will always be a man and if you were born with a vagina you will always be female	If a mother suffers organ damage while carrying a fetus, the fetus will send out stem cells to repair the mother.
If you were the last person on Earth, what would you do and why?	Try to spread my genes to other primates. I wouldn't like it, it would be fucked up, but if there are no human females, it would be my responsibility and duty to spread the human genome to any species able to take it. Chimps would be the likely choice. Now how will i get to Afrika? i suppose i could steal a boat but that would be quite the journey.	If everything was still intact and electricity running, I would do everything on my bucket list. Train myself on flight simulators, fly around the world. Find a jetpack. Watch porn on a jumbo screen Blow up a building. I'm almost certain if it didn't look post apocalyptic when I found out I was the last person, it would look like it within the week.
What double standard bothers you the most?	Hit a man, get hit LIKE a man. As far as a double standard that bothers me; *"I'm a strong independent woman! I'm just as capable and qualified as any man. I can do anything you can do, and I shouldn't be treated as the weaker or fairer sex. I am your equal, damnit!! Umn... can you open this?"*	That it's somehow acceptable for businesses to know everything about you, from how much salary you've been paid at every job, to the contents of your veins, but they don't even have to tell you what range of salary the job pays, nor give you any client references.
What are small things you do to show your SO you love them?	Somewhat sad that half of the replies are people thinking the bare minimum of being civil is considered a romantic gesture (like doing the dishes or saying hello/goodbye).	I take mental notes of small things he mentions he wants or needs. On our first date he told me that he and his dad used to watch this random Christmas movie every year. Since his father passed away when he was 15, I thought it would be nice to get him that movie for our first Christmas. It took me a while to find it but I finally did and when he opened it, he had to excuse himself from the room because he got choked up. I have done that same thing for the last 7 years. If he mentions something in a passing conversation, I will order it for him and either give it to him when I get it or save it for a holiday. He really appreciates that I listen to him and take the time to make him feel special.
How long would it take for you to die if you fall into a bottomless pit?	It'd only take a couple minutes, I'd imagine. The constant acceleration from gravity would eventually have you experiencing more than 3 gs.	Hypothermia? A lot of people are saying dehydration after a couple of days, but with the air constantly moving past you at high speed I reckon that would drop your core body temperature enough to kill you within an hour or two, depending on what you’re wearing.
What's something you really wanted to like, but couldn't?	Pasta. I've dealt with all kinds of shit for hating it, but it's slimy and tastes like glue. Yes, I have tried it "al dente" and it's still gross. I promise I have tried it enough to know that I find it disgusting in every form. Edit: I've tried it with numerous different sauces, with and without meat. I don't even Iike Mac and cheese, even though I love cheese. That nasty macaroni ruins perfectly good cheese. Once again, I assure you that I have tried enough variations to know I hate it.	Clubbing. The few times that I went with my friends it just was not my thing at all. Too crowded, too expensive, and just not my scene at all. Give me a good pub any day.
What was your school's biggest 'urban legend'?	Psychology class in a large lecture hall with a professor lecturing in front of a blackboard. Students decide to use some positive feedback to mess with the professor. The further to the right he moves, the more alert and tuned in they'll appear. The further to the left, they'll start paying less attention. By the end of the semester, the prof is practically teaching from the right corner of the hall. Twist? The prof planted that idea and trained the students to pay attention.	One of our PE teachers husband died while they were on vacation in Thailand and shortly after she married the other PE teacher. Rumor was she murdered him while on vacation. Everyone basically treated it as fact.
What's the worst case of "helicopter parenting" you've seen?	The young ones were left completely on their own. Poor things were trying to learn to fly but they had absolutely no help. One of them even broke its rotor.	While working at new student orientation in college, I was told a story from a previous year. The parents who attended orientation were housed separately from the students. One mom wanted to stay with her daughter, and took the bed of another student. The mom told the student she can find somewhere else to sleep. The student, not knowing what to do, ended up sleeping in a chair in the common area of the dorm.
Unemployed people of reddit, what do you do all day?	Dr. Phil says "if you don't have a job, your job is looking for a job." As in sit at your computer at home from 9-5 every day, searching up job postings, editing your resume and tailoring your cover letter individually, and just constantly applying. And going out to stores and everywhere and hounding the staff to take your resume and cover letters.	When I was unemployed for 5 months, I spent the morning applying to anything and everything relevant. The rest of the day I would try to get outside or find free stuff to do around the city.
What is the strangest way that you have been woken up?	Long time I ago I had a sleepover with a friend, who used glasses. In middle of a night, his N64 controller fell down from a tv-table and landed on my face. When I woke up, I had his pair of glasses in my hand.	I literally sneezed myself awake once. The funny thing was that it really left me feeling refreshed, and I had a pretty good day overall if I recall correctly.
Dog owners of reddit, What breed do you have and why would/wouldn't you recommend it to the rest of us?	American Bulldog. All I can say is they are absolutely stunning examples of loyalty, smarts and strength. Amazing dogs. Google pics online and see what the fuss is about.	Golden Retriever. Their temperament is universally friendly and I have never heard of a golden that's had behavioural problems. I'm sure there have been some, but they respond extremely well to training and require little more than regular exercise, like most large breeds. They do sometimes encounter health problems, but their average lifespan still means that you will have a loyal, loving dog for many years. I just said goodbye to mine after ten years and would never have changed anything about him.
How would the world work if "kid logic" governed reality?	Oh great. The problem is little kids don't *have* logic. Let's just go with anarchy because literally everyone thinks they rule the world.	Wars would just be thousands of soldiers arguing over who shot who first and why they aren't dead because they have a special flak jacket that renders them Impervious to whatever weapon you happen to have, ah but your weapon is the new version of what they are impervious to and so has been designed to counteract their flak jacket tech which is now out dated. EDIT: Thanks for the gold mysterious stranger!
UK Redditors: Can you spot fake British accents in movies and television and does it annoy you?	No "British accent" annoys me as much as the phrase "British accent." &#3232;\_&#3232; Reddit, pay attention: **Britain includes all of the following: England, Scotland and Wales.** Therefore, there is no such thing as a British accent. It's like saying "a European," or even "a Eurasian accent." There isn't one.	A personal favorite set story I've heard is that the guy who played Wormtongue in Lord of the Rings was an American actor, but he kept a British accent at all times on set (even off-camera, between takes) so he wouldn't accidentally slip back into American. On the last day of shooting, after the final shot was done, he slipped back into American accent and congratulated his fellow actors, gave his thanks, and so on. British actor Bernar Hill, who played King Theoden, laughed at Brad Dourif (Wormtongue), and questioned why he was putting on such a comically bad impersonation of an American accent. Hill never realized during the YEARS of shooting LOTR than Dourif wasn't British.
Who are the "I like things to be neat, I'm SO OCD!" people of other conditions?	I lost my job/family member died/life isn't going the way I want it too therefore I'm depressed. No you are not depressed, you are feeling sad/grieving/negative because of a perfectly valid reason. Depression is characterised by no external cause, you feel like shit and there's no good reason for it.	"I took the ladder out of the pool and my Sims drowned" "I cut up the chicken by stabbing it over and over again" "I'm such a psychopath"
What are some common signs that a person is toxic?	Blue hair, horn-rimmed glasses, uses the "#metoo" and "#YesAllMen" hashtags, has Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton or Hussein Obama bumper stickers on her car, wears "#BlackLivesMatter" t-shirts, frequently references non-existent things like "the patriarchy" and "rape culture" and "the wage gap" and "white privilege", bitches about non-issues like "cultural appropriation", refers to her "headmates".	Here is my personal list of red flags: Someone is always hurting them. It’s never the same person. It’s never their fault. They cannot apologize. You are always putting out fires for them with mutual friends. They get upset when you’re upset at them. They act like that is worse than what they did in the first place. They lie about everything. Most of the time it’s about others or things they have done. You always have to raise their spirits but they cannot return the favor.
What is the cruelest thing you've ever seen a teacher do?	I was in 1st or 2nd grade and we had a project where we had to take pictures with friends and have them printed out and all that. Well apparently this kid (who was just a normal kid, didn't do anything) didn't do it right and the teacher (whom I concluded several years later was probably on her period) looked at it, threw it on the ground, and told the kid to pick it up and do it again "the right way" it looked fine to me	Told me to stand behind the door because I was chatting too much. I was five did as told. Principle marched down the corridor and threw the door open to come into the classroom, hitting my face hard. She whipped it back and asked in shock why I was there. I was crying and I looked at my teacher because I was scared to say I was there because I'd been chatting. My teacher looked at me right in the eyes and said, "yeah, why are you standing there?" Can't express into words the kind of strange betrayal I felt as a child.
Who has ever purchased a mail order bride? How did that go for you?	I know a guy who bought one of those mail order brides but didn't feel like paying the shipping when she got here. She's still in a box down at the post office!	not exactly mail-order. But I married a russian woman who was already in the country 11 years ago. We married purely for financial/immigration reasons, but we decided within a few weeks to give the marriage a fair shot. We're still married and are happy together. As the husband of a russian wife, I've met numerous others (husbands of my wife's friends) who have done the straight mail-order thing. I don't think I've seen a successful mail-order marriage with a husband under the age of 50.
When were you the bad guy in someone else’s life story?	There's this girl I stuck my peepee in once or twice. Boy her husband was mad when he learned about it.	I saw an open spot at a very crowded bar and thought “SWEET!”. I went to go order and I right when I got the bartender’s attention I heard “excuse me?”. I looked down and I was leaning over the head of a guy in a wheelchair, hence the open space at the bar. Drunk me didnt put it together and said “hey, whats up?” Then put my order in. When I sobered I realized what a horrible thing Id done. My heart is poinding typing this up.
Reddit, What is your family's biggest secret?	Once my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer, he felt the only way to support us after he left was to become a meth cook. He was a expert on chemistry but was a chemistry teacher at the local high school so put 2 and 2 together. He later became partnered up with an old student of his who was now a drug dealer and wanted his help to distribute the meth he made.	That one of my uncles decided he was Jesus incarnate and left his wife and children to start a cult. One of my parents let something about it slip, but I still can't get out much more than that from anyone.
What event has happened in your life that you cannot explain to this day?	My husband fell in love with me. To this day, I'm still baffled (but not interested in ever letting go).	When my Grandfather died, my parents were in charge of cleaning out his old house. I ended up helping out a couple of times and the night before we were finished I had a dream about my Grandfather is his basement pointing at a spot behind the staircase. It was so vivid and real that I had to tell everyone about it. The next and final day of cleaning we went to the spot I was talking about. My dad ended up pulling back some old wood paneling and found a bunch of old photographs of when my grandparents first moved into the house. I still get goosebumps when I think about it, and have them now while typing.
I just learned that my wife thinks I'm going to kill her. What in the world do I do?	Every other day there is a news story of a husband murdering his wife and/or kids. Are you going to? I don't know. Is it possible? Yes. Is it impossible? No. So her answering 'yes' to the question of 'is there a chance he could kill you' seems a statement of fact. Ofcourse there is a chance. Especially when it seems like you've got nothing else going in your life. Pro tip- it's always the husband.	I'm not bullshitting you man. You're in for a rough road ahead. Time to get a lawyer. Try to be as civil as you can and file for a separation. The shit is about to hit the fan. Now is not the time to be in denial.
Parents of Reddit, please be honest. HAE truly disliked their child and held the child in contempt?	I don't understand this ridiculous concept of unconditional love. Can we be realistic here? My parents were quite disdainful of this concept, and rightfully so: if I turned out to a be a sadistic asshole, they would not have loved me. Or just take it to the extreme: if you spawned the next vile Hitler, could you really love him? Plueeeeze.	My mom confessed to me once that she never really liked my brother from an early age. He was always a difficult, rebellious kid, and as an adult he's been in and out of prison and flirted with white supremacist groups. Nature or nurture, I don't know which.
Medical Professionals of Reddit, When was someone's self diagnoses surprisingly accurate?	Apparently every single teenager online is depressed and no ammount of trained psychiatrists will convince them otherwise. EDIT: -2 because the truth hurts more than any condition.	Saw someone ER. She had a runny nose and was insistent that her cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds your brain) was leaking through her nose and causing her to have a runny nose. This is usually pretty unlikely, especially without a history of trauma. Order a CT of her head, but doesn’t show anything and she otherwise looks fine so she’s sent home. She comes back the next day with a jar of this fluid she had collected saying “this isn’t snot!!” Ran some more tests and turned out she was right. I’m glad she was persistent.
What’s a fact you KNOW that almost everyone is wrong about?	The United States is not this pinnacle of heroism and righteousness that the short hand history books would have you believe. Overall, US History is pretty awful and bloody.	People think that the health department shuts restaurants down for good. Honestly, we don't have the authority to do that. We can close the doors of a restaurant for a certain amount of time in order to fix imminent health hazards, but it would be a gross misuse of our power to close them down permanently.
[Serious] What non life threatening thing do you live in fear of?	A hijab (headscarf) ban in my country. It might not ever happen in my lifetime, because I live in Canada, but with Muslims being portrayed worse and worse as the years go on, I feel like I always have to be prepared somehow. I'm afraid of getting my religious freedoms taken away, and I honestly don't know what I'd do if it ever happened.	Major dental trauma like losing or breaking a tooth. This fear developed when I had no insurance and it never really went away.
April Fool's Day is right around the corner - what's the best easy, harmless prank to pull on coworkers?	Buying him a hamster and a cage and food for it. He won't know I did it and he'll have to take care of it cause he has no one to give it back to.	Tell everyone the day before that you're going to be doing pranks all day, then do nothing and watch them be paranoid.
Ok Reddit, What are some Clever questions asked by cops to get you in trouble?	Rule One: NEVER talk to cops without a lawyer present. Rule Two: FUCKING NEVER EVER EVER talk to fucking pigs without a lawyer present!	I was once pulled over for not wearing a seat belt even though I clearly was. He then asked, "Are you calling me a liar?". Cool. I say "yes" and I don't know what kind of trouble I am in. I say "no" and I get a ticket even though I am wearing a seat belt. I just replied with "I am wearing a seat belt." and of course he wasn't happy about that either. I just don't like his initial question to which there is no correct answer.
Which scene from a scary movie fucked you up as a kid?	where the girl comes out of the TV in the ring. I was watching it once when that scene came and I wet myself, so then I had to sneak my way through the dark and find my father. After the most horrifying experience of my young life of navigating the pitch black, my dad proceeded to wake up and yell at me for pissing myself; then took me out to the car and beat me with a pair of jumper cables for wetting myself.	There's a scene from Alien (don't remember which movie), where the guy climbs into a ventilation shaft and all is quiet, he looks around and there's nothing. And then he turns on a flashlight... *right in the face of the Alien, who was there the whole time*.
Ate alone at a restaurant for the first time last week. And it wasn't even that bad. Reddit, what things did you think would be awkward to do until you actually did them?	Ooooooooo, somebody ate alone. Fucking daredevil. Seriously, what a charmed socially-secure life you must lead. That's the first time that's ever happened? I thought incest would be awkward but then it was awesome.	Going to a bar alone and the movies alone. I always thought people would look at me like I was a loser or something but, in reality, no one gives a shit.
What are some common and popular quotes/sayings that people use incorrectly?	Blood is thicker than water. The full quote is "Blood is thicker than water of the womb," which means the opposite of what people mean when they use the quote.	Everybody know the "curiosity killed the cat" but the full quote is "curiosity killed the cat but satisfaction brought it back"
Reddit, what is your most cringe worthy 'open mouth, insert foot' story?	"nice to meet you, sir." *"ma'am"* "i'll show myself out." greeting parents at a children's testing facility is hard when you were raised in the south.	I was walking through an office building when a blind gentleman asked me where the restroom was. I said "you go down this hallway and it's at the end on your left. Don't worry, you'll see it". I got about 2 steps before I realized what I had said.
Commuters of Reddit, what is the most memorable experience you've had whilst using public transport?	When I was at university, I got the last train out of Liverpool after a gig. There was a very very drunk girl sat just across from me. Just after the train set off, she took off her knickers, squatted on the seat and peed everywhere. There was a lot of it. It was running down the aisle. I didn't want to stand in it so I was trapped. I couldn't get off as it was the last train and mine was the last stop. It absolutely stank. She didn't care.	A man entered the carriage with a ghetto blaster on his shoulder playing the local classical station at full volume.
CEOs of reddit, how did you get there?	Well it starts by being born into a rich family. Then it's just a lot of lying, cheating, stealing, etc. always sacrificing integrity to getting ahead. I never forget to tout myself as the greatest of all time in everything ever. Eventually I became CEO. It's easy, I don't understand why nobody else does it.	From my experience on LinkedIn you just set it as your title and then post a bunch of business articles.
[Serious] Why isn't personal finance a mandatory high school class?	Because that would bring down the entire banking system. Just imagine what would happen if a considerable proportion of people stopped living on credit, and instead started to budget their life within their means? The system is set up in such a way that it relies on people being largely ignorant of its inner workings.	There are only *so many* hours in a school day. My kids took a personal finance unit in school....I believe it was a semester long. The one who's personality leans toward *instant gratification* didn't learn any useful lessons in the class. The one who's more conservative, financially, pretty much already knew the basics. I'm not sure it would really help at that age, quite honestly. It's something that should be taught *throughout childhood*, in the formative years, and then reinforced in early adulthood when it's applicable.
What is your favourite podcast? What is it about?	Guys We F***ed - 2 girls talking about female sexuality and how women should not be afraid to embrace it. Also a ton of hilarious and frank stories!	Dan Carlin - Hardcore History Dan LIVES history. The way he tells the stories are so enticing, and exciting. Each episode is around 6 hours long (perfect for road trips). Even if your not a history fan, this man will turn you.
Guys who have somehow managed to successfully suck their own dick, how was it?	Make sure you wrap a mango around it so you'll be losing weight while having a mouth-full of your own cock	It doesn’t really feel good or anything. It’s so much work getting down there, only for you to realize you have a mouthful of your own dick.
Men of reddit. What movies make you tear up and maybe cry?	Honestly none of them. I can't get sad over a character who I found out about less than an hour and a half ago who I have never met. I know real people who have died and I didn't cry for why would I cry over a fictional character?	When the dog dies in I am Legend. Actually, not when it dies, but just after it saves Will Smith and then he sees it, and it's been all fucked up.
What Movie was the biggest let down of 2015?	star wars 7, it was just too predictable at times and I didn't think it lived up to its name	Aloha. All star cast, Emma Stone is easy on the eyes...The story line made zero fucking sense. One of the reviews I read put it perfectly: "Aloha is the worst thing to happen to Hawaii since the attack on Pearl Harbor."
What's a green flag when you meet somebody for the first time?	No green flags ever last. Whenever it happens it's all honey moon phase for a while then it fades and dies and I remain alone. Except for a couple of friends with whom I have nothing in common with but can't leave because then I'd go from 98% alone to 100% alone.	When they have good humour is pretty much the biggest green flag for me. Both in being funny and finding similar things funny.
Women of Reddit, what has been your worst 'nice guy' experience?	Was a friend helping me through my LDR. Last week while I was tipsy and emotionally compromised he decides he wants to make out. Now I get to explain to my BF what happened and probably lose my relationship. To top it off this guy still wants us to get together and be friends	Ugh. I have so many. Maybe the one who became my friend and waited for me and my boyfriend to break up, and then comforted me after the breakup (I was in a bad spot). I thanked him for his companionship and I told him upfront that I wasn't interested in him, and wouldn't be, and he assured me he still wanted to be friends regardless of whether or not we ended up dating. I felt like I couldn't have been more clear. But he kept trying to get me to change his mind, and acted like we were dating when we were around his friends, until I confronted him about it. I told him for the tenth time that I didn't see him as more than a friend; he acted genuinely shocked about it (including tears) and our friendship pretty much dissolved right after that.
Private Investigators, what is your best story?	There was a drug dealer in california who's ex wife belived he took something of hers. I found where he hung out thanks to his unusally high amount of porno mag subscriptions one of which he tossed in the garbage thus leading to his address. I walked into the joint I've been casing for almost two weeks dressed as a health inspector since the front was a bar and made my way around back. There I opened a door and saw the thing I've been looking for, not just for this case but my entire time as a Private investigator. Before me where 95 rock hard erected penises and a sign saying "use the serious tag next time".	I did a little investigating on the side way back in the day. Through some surveillance I was able to catch my 8 year old neighbor in the act of using a shovel to fling his dogs poop over the fence into our yard. Thus solving the mystery of why I swore I was picking up our dogs poop and then there was still poop in the yard afterward. He had pick up my dogs poop for a month after that. I had to retire from PI duty shortly after that because middle school took up too much of my time. Also not enough cases could be solved by Encyclopedia Brown style logic puzzles.
What's the best job where you have to do almost nothing?	Lifeguard Edit: I have worked as a lifeguard for the past 6 years, I know my business. Depends on the pool, but in general? I consider lifeguarding very easy. Where I currently work, depending on who is using the pool, (there are 2 pools with a divider in each, totaling 4 possible stands) there are between 2 and 5 guards on, meaning anywhere from 30 on stand 30 off, to 2 hours on, 30 off. I have been at pools where there is no break for a full 8 hour shift.. still think lifeguarding is a sweet gig if you're in the right place. I do not recommend working at a public pool, but a school (preferably a college or university).	I worked for the university I attended in a department that helped faculty members create online content for their students. It'd be super cool, but hardly anyone ever asked us for help. So I played Civ and watched Netflix most of the time. Pretty sweet gig.
Firefighters of reddit what is the strangest thing a person insisted on going back for into the burning building?	OP, your edits got insane. NEVER edit back "SOoooooo many upvotes" "Front pagggeeeee" Because we KNOW how many upvotes you have. We KNOW you're on the front page. It just makes you sound like a middle schooler squealing with excitement like a pig the week after thanksgiving. Just calm down.	The one that sticks with me, from about 15 years ago: pretty good fire in an occupied story-and-a-half, and a frantic civilian is on the front porch, just outside the front door, holding a monster-sized television set in his arms. I'm the first fireman up the stairs, and he yells to me, "My kids! My kids are inside!" And I am not making that up.
What is the scariest/weirdest/most-fucked-up dream you can remember?	I dreamt about zombies last night. To escape the horrors above ground I descended into the subway. The dark was nearly impenetrable. The smell of panic and decay filled my nostrils. As my pupils dilated, adjusting to the light as well as the fear, I could make out a mass of dark, faceless shapes; people, some trying to help their sickened loved ones, others lying motionless, some sobbing in the fetal position. But the worst were the ones who were walking. Some came from the tunnels, others rose before my eyes. As They stumbled through the crowd with their outstretched, grasping hands I became aware that I could not distinguish the cries of fear from the moans of hunger. This place was not safe. I went back into the light.	My father who I haven't seen in many many years threatened me with a gun. I punched him in the face, took the gun and was about to shoot him when he said:"do it, but you have worse problems than me. Solve them first" I just stood there, couldn't shoot anymore and dropped the gun. Then I woke up. The dream was very vivid and I think about it a lot. It was weird.
What would you gift a young person with who's house recently burnt down?	A coupon to let them sleep at your house in exchange for sexual favors from the females in his family.	Clothes or gift card at a place that sells clothes perhaps similar to what they had. Most likely they only have what they were wearing.
Waiters/Servers of reddit, have you ever overheard illegal or hilarious things when at tables?	Im not a server, but i had our waiter yesterday give my friend the dirtiest look when I loudly (and purposefully) spoke about the time he took an underage girl home from a bar that had told him she was 21. Ahh good times	Once heard someone telling their young son that he wasn't allowed any garlic bread because he was part vampire, the boy started crying.
Redditors who don't like/understand video games, why not?	so many passive aggressive "it is a waste of time" and "I have a real life" posts. Try wording your high horse comments in a way that isn't derogatory.	They just don't hold my attention. I have friends who can play for hours at a time but no matter what game it is, I lose interest in an hour, save my spot and do something different for the day.
What is your first world problem(s) today?	Well, I don't have to my (one of the best in the state) high school until later because of testing in the lower grades. So here I am, laying in bed, listening to music, bored out of my mind, wishing I could get with this one girl in my English class, who I could never get with. Life doesn't get much harder than this, folkss	It's warm enough outside so I don't need a jacket, but it's cold inside so I need a jacket 😧
Managers of reddit.. when did you call bullshit on an applicant's employment history or reference?	We were interviewing this guy and he claimed he worked in Brazil for 2 years and was fluent in Portugese. So we talked about cities in Brazil (of course he could only name Rio and Sao Paulo) and when we got to Belo Horizonte I knew he was full of shit. I was overruled and we hired him anyways. However his ego got the best of him because he never quit his other job, and just came in for one day. He was caught still working at his other company, HR from both companies go together and he was fired from both :) Didn't last long enough to collect a pay check!	Claimed to be fluent in french... Conducted the interview in french. She failed. Nothing in the job qualifications required her to be fluent in french... so I don't even know why she put it there.
HIKERS and BACKPACKERS of Reddit. What is the weirdest or creepiest thing you have found while hiking?	I'm an elk hunter. I've come across NATIVE elk killed by the CANADIAN gray wolves (introduced by the federal government in Idaho in 1995, rather than the NATIVE timber wolf), in which the only part of the el that was eaten was the throat and asshole. This has happened twice in the last seven years.	Been waiting years for this question: Hiking alone at dusk doing a five mile loop in the Santa Monica Mountains in Los Angeles. I see another lone hiker approaching from the opposite direction. As he gets closer, I suddenly realize I know this person: It's the guy who played Jame Gumb, aka Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs. We get within three feet of each other. He looks at me. He sees the lightning bolt of recognition hit my face. His sad and resigned expression back said it all: "Yes, I'm him. No, I'm not really a serial killer." I walked briskly by him anyway and didn't look back until I was a good 100 yards down the trail.
Teachers of Reddit, how did you deal with a student that had a crush on you?	i did the only mature and professional thing i could think of at the time. took her to the principal's office and had all the school's staff run train on her, me being first.	I’ve had preschoolers who want to marry me. I say I can’t until they get a job and can drive a car.
What's the most calculated thing you've ever seen an animal do?	When I was ten, my father took the family to the zoo. My younger sister and I had an immediate fascination with the monkeys. Near the end of the day, we begged our father to take us to the monkeys one last time. One of the larger monkeys was sticking out a hand at people walking by, waving it around and shit like that. Turned out he was handing out flyers... and that's how I joined scientrology.	My gf has a rule that her dog is not allowed in the kitchen. Whenever he tries to break this rule she puts him on the carpet right outside the kitchen with a stern talking to. The second she turns her back he will slide one paw forward like 2 inches to barely touch the kitchen floor. Her dog is very passive aggressive. Kinda like his owner.
Whats your "I'm glad I tried it, but never again" story?	A Link Between Worlds, Zelda fans may worship it as God but I thought it was boring and I wasted my money, but hey now I can proudly say I don't like 2d Zelda games, so it has that going for me.	Hot air balloon. I was 4500 feet in the air for an hour and a half with nothing separating me from a horrifying death but a wicker basket.
[Serious] Whats the worst parenting you've ever seen?	Lisa's mom, hands down. I've never heard her say anything to anyone that wasn't horrible, especially to her daughter. Sided with Lisa's rapist. Tried to hire a hit man to kill Lisa. It's not really surprising that Lisa ended up in prison.	Mother banging on the glass to get the attention of a gorilla in the zoo next to her son and a sign saying "Please don't bang on the glass". I know there are far worse examples of bad parenting but this one just struck a chord with me. EDIT:For spelling
My 11 year old sister's phone number and our address has been posted on a porn site and she is getting harassing calls and texts. What am I supposed to do?	Your sister because she appears to be "looking for a good time." Seriously though that sucks and I'm sorry that happened. And thank you for contributing to Reddit one of the best revenge pranks I've ever heard.	Notify your sister's school. Save evidence of the cyberbullying. Contact the girls' parents and make them aware of the harassment. Make them aware that civil suits have been filed for less abusive situations than this and resulted in significant penalties. Make it clearly known to the local police that your family would be within its rights to file a civil suit against them as well if they don't properly investigate. Contact a local news channel's investigative reporting desk. Just don't let the fire burning in your gut flame out.
[Serious] [nsfw] Those of you who regularly visit a prostitute/strip club: why do you do it and does anybody know about this habit?	I frequent strip clubs with friends in Denver, CO usually after a heavy night of drinking. Pro-tip: bring girls with you..strippers love girls, and it makes you look less intimidating. Pro-tip #2: If your GF is open to going, bring her along. She may just get turned on by you getting turned on. Source: Went on Easter. Strip club was the catalyst for several three-somes.	No hookers or escorts, but I used to frequent strip clubs because I was single and worked a manual labor job with all other guys. The female attention at a "gentleman's club" was alluring and immediate.
If life was an RPG, what stat would you say you've dumped all your XP in to?	Intelligence and Wisdom probably be equal as higher than normal, with a little extra in Charisma (gift of the gab). I'm average strength, average looks, average luck, slightly above average dexterity (fixing all those computers and playing all those games), slightly above constitution (yay for surviving all sorts that should have killed me but didn't).	I spread my stats instead of focusing on one. Now I'm a level 25 jack of all trades, master of none.
Parents whose kids never dated/found love/got married, how do you feel about it?	I'm 17 and my dad is worried because I have no desire to date at all. I'm totally down for a life of masturbating, fucking around with synth sounds, and not being told what do to by a woman I once loved and 3 gremlins	I should ask my father. Then again he also never found love, he and my mother only had me because both hate the idea of abortion.
Walmart employees what are some of the craziest/dumbest things that you have seen customers do while shopping at Walmart?	I am a former Walmart employee (stuck it out for 10 years) and the silliest thing I recall a customer doing was when a very large woman in an electronic cart (the Walmart ones) rolled up to me in electronics and asked "Where are your pedometers?" ... ... Planning on doing a lot of walkin are ya?? On the gross side, I worked Connection Center a while (cell phones) and had a string out, skinny crack whore looking woman come in and ask me to fix her Tracphone .. and then she proceeded to pull it out of her sweaty dirty bra. Hit up that hand sanitizer REAL fast after that. Im sure there are SO many more I can't recall, but ive kinda blocked out those memories...	Ex walmart employee here. Middle aged man with his daughter, she was probably 3. She was having a hissy fit as 3 year olds tend to do. He was dragging her and then hit her so hard. If he had hit me that hard I would have bruised badly and cried, and I'm an adult woman. She imeediately is on the ground crying and his yelling alerted a manager close by. As I'm grabbing a phone my manager grabs my arm and says "don't call the police, it's not your business" and she walks up to the man with a huge smile and says "how can I help you?" You bet I called the police anyway. She found any reason to try to fire me after that. So I quit about a week later.
For those with a VERY happy marriage/relationship portrayed on FB, what dark secrets do you struggle with in your relationship that would be absolutely shocking to those that only see you on FB?	I don't post a lot about my relationship on fb good or bad, but I will admit that we've had some rough patches mostly my fault due to my bipolar and being in a manic faze, I've cheated on him(kissed other men) and spent money needlessly that should have went to bills and throw fits over the little and simplest things, yet through it all he's stuck by me and I love him even more for it	According to my brothers FB he's married with three kids and it seems like they all live together. Reality is he got kicked out years ago. The kids are with two different women (and I'm not convinced are all his), he sees them about once a month now. He lives with my parents. When I finally saw the stuff he was posting on facebook I was shocked, no idea why he keeps up the fiction, it seems like it'd hurt more doing that if I were in his position.
[Serious] Reddit, how are the Police in your city and how do you feel around them?	The NYPD officers I've seen interacting with people seem pretty snarky and stereotypically direct, but I trust that they mean well.	*Nothing* happens in my city. Someone getting pulled over for speeding? Better send 2 other cops just because there's nothing going on.
What is your best "because I got high" moment?	My sister knew a guy who got so high he ended up kidnapping a child thinking it was a Hobbit. Edit: He returned the child as soon as his friends found out what he did and ended up getting community service due to his 'circumstances'	Havent smoked much since highschool, got real ripped up at a buddies. Just had to move my car out of the way for his brother or something. Im coming up from behind the car and get in. *I got in the back seat and took a good 5 seconds to figure out where the wheel was* My friends were in tears. Sadly this was not the last time i have done this
Everyone talks about roomates from hell. What's your "roomate from heaven" story?	I don't really there will be many 'stories' about roommates from heaven. The best roommates are the ones that you end up being close friends with.	We simply lived together in peace. When it was time to clean up, we did so. When one of us was feeling too lazy to do so, we postponed it. We both loved football, we respected the division of the tasks at home, we respected each other personal spaces. We could trust each other. If one wanted to drink or smoke outside, the other would respect and keep it to himself. Also, he killed the cockroaches that I was afraid of, and I the rats that he feared. And that is it, there isn't need to any heroic act, we were really good friends and lived good years together.
Redditors who have objected at weddings or seen someone object, what happened in the next 5 minutes?	You won't believe it but the groom's fiancè claimed that she was part of some space government and shot up the groom! He was cool. I'll miss him. There was a huge gunfight afterwards and we had to bail. Fucking crazy!	My dad marrying his third wife. My step brother and I were in the wedding party. He was about 6, I was 10. The preacher asks if anyone objects and my brother raises his hand so very politely. My dad asks why, and my step brother replies, "because I want you to promise to take me fishing whenever I want, first."
When you were growing up, who was the first band that gave you that musical "magic" feeling?	I was a bit of a late bloomer. I didn't really find what turned me on until I was 17. Daft Punk's Alive 2007 changed everything I thought I knew about music. I really can't even stand listening to rock bands any longer, and I no longer feel like a freak when I tell people Led Zeppelin is one of the worst bands I've ever heard. They're like the Nickleback of the 70s.	my elementary music teacher was/is a hard core rock dude and so is my dad. when I first hear Tom saywer by Rush or when I first heard Brass Monkey by Beastie Boys or both was when I felt that "magical" music feeling
Married people of Reddit. What's something sweet/kind you so on a regular basis for your spouse that they probably never notice?	Sometimes when my wife is asleep I pry open her ass-cheeks and put a jelly tot in between them. Sometimes I put two, but only if their colours match.	Plug her phone into the charger when it's low on battery, because she usually forgets. Or sneak out of the house when she's asleep - like now - to buy maple syrup before she wakes up so we can have pancakes. Edit: am not Canadian
Employees of Reddit: What awesome perk/benefit do you get from your job?	I used to work as a pidgeon tamer. It was *extremely tough work* (the darn birds would always put up a fight when I scrambled around trying to grab their beaks!). The main perk? Pidgeon for dinner every night, on the house. As in, I killed them and ate them. For dinner. **TL;DR Pidgeon meat for dinner** *PS: Pidegeon tastes like the rarest steak in France, with extra pepper*	I used to work in radio. Thousands of people would hear my opinions and I wouldn't have to hear theirs. It was great.
my boss just got mad at me for showing up five minutes early, instead of ten minutes! (cause we have so much set up to do). What 'crazy boss' story do you have today?	I used to work in the pharmaceutical industry. My job was to weigh the the medications on a micro scale, so as to insure that the milligrams were accurate on the labels. As the work was slower than a soup kitchen line, I sometimes sang to myself various jives I learned on the bayou. So bossman walks in on my singing and tell me that I was disturbing the other peoples that be workin' there. Then he get up in mah face and start spittin' game like "You spreadin yo' filthy sangin like you was singin in th' trap to yo d'boys" so I was all like "Niqqua yo best shut ya'll damn cracka whitey face!" That niqqua kept runnin his mouth so ah bust a cap in his motherfukin azz.	my old boss got mad at me because I told him if I was going to work overtime, I wanted to get paid.
Every good actor has been in at least one bad movie. What's your example of a bad actor in a great film?	Granted I haven't seen him in much else, but they could have picked a *much* better Frodo than Elijah Wood. Or at least trained him to say "Mordor" and not "Muldor." Also, if he could pick a reaction between "overly sappy" and "dying *again,*" that'd be great...	Orlando bloom in lord of the rings. I hate him in everything else but in lord of the rings he nails it.
What things happen in movies often that are very unrealistic?	Not exactly movies, but in cartoons. Quicksand turned out to be much less of a problem in the real world than I thought it would be.	High schoolers having 2 minute classes followed by half-hour breaks to go to their lockers. Edit: I am looking at you, *Glee*.
What are some random animal facts that you can say off the top of your head?	Elephants think humans are cute, so they reach out with their trunks to pet us. If an elephant sees a human asleep it will get sad thinking it died and will cover it with leafs	mice can fit through a hole the size of a ballpoint pen dolphins know when a woman is pregnant because they have extremely good hearing and can hear two heart beats male sea horses get preggers having sex with a horse will kill you wasps are assholes
What was something you did as a child that completely showed the kind of adult you would be?	I’m not an adult but I am a teenager. Had a tug of war with my friend, we were holding yoghurt. It burst all over us and our teacher was furious & we couldn’t stop laughing Also another time my mum was trying to teach me to ride a bike and I always refused, she asked why and I responded with “well do you ride yours?” To which she responded “no” so I said “why do I have to ride mine?” So she just gave up	Older sister: Give me the washcloth 5yo me: No Older Sister: Give me the washcloth!!! Me: Ask nicely.. Older sister: \*sigh\* .... my dear beloved brother.. could you please? give me the washcloth? Me: no, I'm using it
What is the one thing about you that surprises people?	That I smoke. I'm a 16 year old alternative chick yet I don't come off as a stoner or smoker.	I can't snap my fingers. Everybody has to try to teach me after they find out too. If I haven`t learned after 29 years it`s not going to happen. Edit: stop trying to teach me via the internet.
[Serious] What happened to you that forced you to quickly mature?	she put the barrel to her head, and pulled the trigger I couldn't even go to the funeral. I had to watch her cry.	Realized I was addicted to drugs and alcohol at 17. Had to lose all my friends and shape up. Long road to sobriety but I have been living it for over 5 years. I had to mature overnight.
Have you ever had and experience hiring an escort or a prostitute? Any regrets, funny stories, etc.?	It was my first day back from Iraq and I decided to order an escort to come to my hotel room. She arrives and we get straight to it and then after I bust my nut, I exhale and ask her if she takes card. She whips out an old fashion carbon copier and slides my card. She then asks for my address in case of false payment, and I gave her the address to the hotel. After she left, I immediately canceled my credit card. Best $240 gift ever.	Hired prostitutes a few times when I was in Korea. I wouldn't bother at this point in my life. I have found that having sex completely devoid of emotion with a bored girl looking at the clock waiting for you to hurry up and cum is just not my thing (and for you guys that think you're special and YOU can turn her on, forget it), I'd rather use my hand and use the money I saved for beer.
What unfortunate things have happened to you on your birthday?	I didn’t get the $17,000,000 yacht that I wanted, instead I got a stupid iphone 10+ with diamond encrusted backplate and its only worth $230,000. RUINED MY DAY Yeah this is a joke	My 16th birthday my grandma had a massive heart attack. That was pretty shitty. However 5 stents later she's still alive today, nearly 23 years later so there's that.
[Serious] Redditors who were suicidal but decided not to kill yourself, what changed your mind?	Due to religion. Suicide, ends up in Hell. If I die doing a good deed or saving someone, ends up in Heaven. Very broad generalization but when you are that low and narrow, your decision making can be very cloudy. Somewhat similar to what happened to PTSD patients.	This one time my buddy happened to come over after work and we unloaded the gun, I spent a few weeks at his place.
What traditions need to end?	Saying "God bless you" when someone sneezes. Pretty sure no ones soul is in danger. Why do we need to acknowledge and publicly call out people who are sneezing???	The new tradition of 'black friday'. It's marketed like a holiday when in reality it's a shallow effort to flog the shit the shops couldn't sell normally. Fine if you get something you have had your eye on, but it's just a sale, don't make it out to be a once in a lifetime opportunity.
What's a deal breaker in a friendship for you?	If anyone claims to be a SJW or part of the SJW movement, id just laugh and cut then off.	People who act like your friend when your alone and they seem so cool but as soon as a we're in a group they start talking so much shit. I really hate that hypocrisy.
What's something we'd probably hate you for?	Should have made a throwaway for this, but fuck it! The truth must be known. It's not easy for me to say this, but...I'm euphoric because of a phony god's blessing. EDIT: Downboats? Really?	I'm the guy at the hospital that tells you it's time to leave and you owe us *x* amount of dollars.
What's the most awkward thing you've witnessed at a high school reunion?	not a proper reunion but since I still live at home and my high school is like 20 min from my university and sounded by good restaurants I some times eat linch in its vicinity. I was tackle hugged in a restaurant by one of my friends who though 3 years bellow me became pretty good friends with me.	Not me but my BIL's highschool reunion. A guy that was severely bullied in highschool started a Facebook group to get the ball rolling on planning a highschool reunion, he planned the venue, food, drinks and asked everyone pay a ticket price to cover it all. He organised the money go into a provided bank account, received 200+ peoples HS reunion dollarydoos and fucked off. Never to be heard of again. Ive never laughed so hard in my life.
[NSFW] Taxi drivers of Reddit, what is the strangest thing to have happened in your cab?	Drove this girl called Jenny once to a hotel. She said something about meeting up with a guy for kisses.	There used to be -- maybe still is -- a cab driver in Toronto who called himself Mr Geography. He'd let you ask him geography questions during the ride and he'd get them all right. Slightly off topic, but it's not like that story is useful very often.
What's the most fucked-up thing you've ever done and you can't tell people because they would think you're totally crazy?	Strangled a cat and threw it in the river. I love cats now, by the way. Just answering the question.	My crush in junior high carved her name into my arm with a rock she sharpened. And I willing let her do this. Jesus I was fucked up.
Tattoo Artists of Reddit: Is there a line you won't cross?	Some asshole tattoo'ed my kid on his 18th birthday while he was drunk and still in high school. Put a four inch Irish knot on his fucking neck. Took ten trips to the laser doc to get that removed. I grounded the kid for two months, I'd still like to punch the cock sucker that inked him.	I've asked my tattoo artist this question too. He won't do wings on the back (he can't stand them). I asked him what the strangest tattoo he's ever done was, and he told me he had tattooed a woman's nipple pinkish because it had become discoloured due to surgery from breast cancer. I thought that was neat!
What's your "Did they really just say that" story?	My Peruvian brother-in-law and my uncle were talking about the NFL. My dumb as rocks Aunt chimed in with a "Oh you mean your people football?" My entire family was speechless.	My first job was at a movie theater. I was ringing at the concession stand. A gentleman walked up to order, looked at my name tag, said my name, then said "that's a dumb name."
People of Reddit, is there anyone you know who is both incredibly smart and stupid at the same time? What makes them smart, and what makes them not so smart?	Me. Just got hired to work on building self-driving cars, got fired for fighting with coworkers in a group chat.	My neighbor used to work for NASA before he retired. Apparently they had a bus take them to and from work because so many wouldn't be able to remember how to get home. And now that I work with engineers day-to-day, yea, I can see it. It's like all that school fried their brains.
People whose work brings them into other people's homes, what shit have you seen?	While working as an Electrician in Philly I went into a low income house in a bad part of town. Really nice old lady and her teenage grandson who I never saw. Had to go into his room and I noticed in the corner a stack of like a dozen nice car stereos/cd players obviously (we thought) stolen. After mentioning it to my helper we decided to at least fuck with him by removing all the inline fuses. Petty but other than calling the cops there wasnt much else we could do.	I once delivered pizza to a falcon tamer, whose falcon was just chilling with him on the porch. That was exciting.
People who drive large trucks with Confederate flags and/or truck nuts: what was your relationship with your mother like growing up?	What the fuck is the point of this question? As if having the latest Apple shit and drinking Starbucks makes one soooo enlightened. I think truck nuts are stupid too but at least when I see someone's proud of being a redneck I also see someone who can probably operate machinery vs someone who went to college and is doing nothing with it. Those people are the fucking worst.	I'm from an area where these truck accessories are very popular (the South). These dudes seem to have good relationships with their moms. Its them books they don't get along with.
Teachers of Reddit, what is something a student of yours has said that made you think 'wow, there is no hope left for you'?	This is ridiculous. If any teacher actually thinks "there is no hope left for you" about a student, they shouldn't have a teaching certification. Every student I have had and will ever have, has some sort of hope left. That is the purpose of education.	Principal at an inner city high school. I had to sit down with a student who had been caught plagiarizing for a second time. This time.... from The Onion.
What film disturbed you the most?	Zach and Miri Make a Porno. The whole premise is they can't pay their bills so they have to make a porno. But the whole time Miri has an $80 hairdo. What's up with that? Along with the shit scene and how they fall in love and then things get weird, very disturbing.	The Act of Killing. There's nothing more surreal than watching mass murderers and rapists walk around freely, laugh about their crimes, be interviewed on television and then act out their crimes. It's honestly the most disturbing and affecting thing I've ever seen.
HR and Recruiters, what is an instant "Well, this person isn'tgetting the job" thing a candidate can do during a job interview for you?	We have a few parts in our interview process where we preface a problem with “we know this is silly but imagine...” and any time someone is unwilling to suspend disbelief or participate in the scenario it’s so tiresome. We even had one hoodlum make fun of the problems! It’s especially frustrating because we structure these problems this way so we’re not taking advantage of candidate’s work as free labor, and they can be entertaining for everyone if the candidate participates!	I was interviewing clerks for a gas station. One was a relative of a friend of my supervisor. He was clean and showed up on time. He also answered every question with "Back when I was selling crack cocaine..." My supervisor said I had to hire him, so I did. It went as well as you might imagine.
What can you say to piss off the most people, while still being technically correct?	A trans person is still genetically the sex they were born as, and anything considering surgery/pronouns/etc is **asking everyone to pretend otherwise.** Edit: thank you all for attempting to debate me and tell me how wrong I am! You are welcome to present an XY male that, through gender reassignment surgery and lifestyle changes is now an XX female and I will completely admit defeat. Edit 2: made it to SRS! I'm clearly a misogynistic, bigoted piece of shit for saying a scientific fact!	I'm getting more pissed off by the fact that most of what I'm reading is in fact, not technically correct. Edit: It's now 17 hours since I posted this comment and almost all the comments sorted by 'best' are technically correct. Good job reddit.
Landlords of Reddit, what's the worst tenant you've ever had?	Tenants lived upstairs for 3 months, didn't pay the third month's rent, called in (as me) to cut off my utilities, reported me to Children's Division for child abuse... moved out leaving 18 bags of garbage & reported me to the fire department for the garbage hazard. *just posted this to another similar question.	1. DIY ''expert'', BBQ under veranda = melted/burnt roof, Ripped out the copper piping without turning off gas mains, enormous gas/water leak, street evacuated. 15k in the red. He declared bankrupcy so I'll never see a dime. Former teacher turned DJ. 2. Speed OD, threatened to kill me on my birthday, shit everywhere. 3. Big drug deals, shit and jerked off in bucket when he was told to leave as a parting gift, fucked prostitutes in hallway, condoms everywhere, pubes everywhere. People who complain about empty houses, don't know what it's like to be a landlord. I gave it up, because I'm not that good at threatening to kill people. Apparently this is required if you have a certain level of tenant, even if you're friends with the local cops.
What was the most satisfying "No" you have ever told someone?	This girl gave me a blow job a couple weeks after turning me down for my friend. She wanted to take it further after she swallowed, and I said no. She left after that, and then I smoked a joint, ate some chips and played assassins creed. T'was a good day.	I hope I speak for many when I relay the utter satisfaction of refusing to cover a shift for someone who makes your life at work a living hell and has unfortunately landed themselves into a hungover pickle on a Sunday morning. Telling that asshole I have an important commitment and then rolling over into my sweet, sweet bed, the only true thing I ever want to commit to........... shit, it doesn't get better.
Reddit, how did you meet your current best friend?	Hmmm ive known my best friend for 6 years j....almost got me we will call him carlos , i met carlos at the same bonfire i received my name from, he was the guy that pulled me out of it, i owe him my life he has since then been an awsome friend.	In college we dated the same guy...simultaneously. Seven months into the relationship (for me; 9 for her) we both figured it, decided to meet to discuss it, realized we're both pretty awesome, confronted our bastard soon-to-be ex, and we've been best friends ever since.
What is the scariest nightmare you ever had that still bothers you?	A couple of years ago, I had two sleep paralysis in a period of three weeks. That was particular! I'm not scared per say, but because of the strange nature of the experience I documented myself quite, and now when I tell the story of what it is and what happened, I always end up having a chill down my spine and goosebumps. Just a reaction to the threat sleep paralysis conveys. Pretty neat :D	Random things start exploding. Myself and family start running away. Hear a LOUD Microsoft Windows "error" sound. Look at sky. Windows dialogue box pops up in sky with error message. Everything starts going black and I wake up.
Reddit, when did you realize that people find you attractive?	When i went to college and girls started telling me how nice my smile was (straight teeth dimples master race), also most guys in college don't take care of themselves and i always did. so the combo of a nice smile, not smelling like a beer-soaked gym sock, and not having a beer/hot pocket gut went a long way to help me realize i wasn't a bad looking dude.	I'm not physically attractive but I've been told I have a sexy voice. I didn't really think much about it or believe it until I got a job as telephone tech support. Women would straight up tell me I had a sexy voice and ask if I was an actor or on the radio. Sometimes they'd root around to see if we in the same part of the country. If they only knew that I usually look like I just fell out of a tree. My wife says she likes my looks but she has to - we have kids together. :)
Reddit, what is your best instant karma story?	One night I got really drunk and took a bunch of Xanax and ran amok in my friend's apartment complex. I don't know exactly what happened but I woke up the next morning clutching a brand new longboard. I loved this longboard. I always wanted one but never got one. I'd ride it around my neighborhood all the time. I'd even just ride it through my hallways just because I could. I knew I stole it and that some poor sucker was now out of a longboard, but I didn't care. I loved my new longboard and I treasured it. 2 weeks later my friend brought it outside and forgot to bring it in, and some other dude stole it from me. I am still heartbroken	When I was a kid (about 9 or so), my dad and I were at the airport food court eating while waiting on our flight. My eyes were bigger than my stomach and I didn't touch my fries. Rather than throw them away, I asked some lady if she wanted them (free, of course). When we get to the main lobby for our flight, lo and behold, who do we see? Yup, that same lady. She was in the main kiosk as a flight agent, and she let us know she gave us a comp upgrade to business class. That was the first time I had ever flown business class. *edit* Thanks for the gold kind stranger! 1st time getting gilded...this is like Reddit business class right?!
If you could get rid of one social custom what would it be?	Monogamy... Seriously, I love my wife and would never hurt her by cheating, but I can't say that I don't think/fantasize about other women, and having open relationships would help a lot.	I'm from Alabama, and in the south, never *ever* ask anyone how they are doing, especially if they are over 50. You will get their entire life story, along with a full list of any ailments and aches and pains they may have. Just nod a polite greeting then run away.
Every morning, as a camp counselor, I would pick a random kid, raise him up from his bed, and play "The Circle of Life" (The Lion Kind Song) to wake up the rest of the cabin. What are some little things you do to entertain yourself at work?	First off, you sir are awesome. At work I'd find a rubber band and mess with it. I'd be occupied for hours.	At one of my jobs (a low-volume retail store), I'd sometimes go 15-20 minutes between customers. I would play dress-up (accessory store) and pretend to be over-exaggerated personalities. "Real Housewives of Minnesota" was my favorite to dress up as. Really stereotypical soccer mom stuff and false Fargo-esque accent.
What was your "I'm to old for this shit" moment?	Younglings calling in sick because they're coming down with a cold. Grab a DayQuil and a box of Kleenex and get your ass to work...is what I want to say, but HR says nay nay.	Worked in a call center. Would get in trouble for "unscheduled breaks" had to wait hours until my break to use the bathroom. Felt just like being back in middle school with teachers telling you when or when you couldn't use the bathroom.
What opinion do you hold that is generally looked down upon or laughed at?	I believe that marriage is ONLY between a man and a woman, I hold strong that belief, and everyone laughs.	"Blood is thicker than water." Bullshit. Some family members are complete assholes and should steer clear from. I don't understand how I'm a jerk for not being "forgiving." There's only so many times one can forgive.
In America, if your loved one gets hospitalized, rushed to surgery, and dies, do you still get saddled with the bill?	Yes. The debt falls to your estate. If they think the debt is worth as much or more than your estate, your children/family will get nothing. Because US hospitals are insane, the kind of situation you're describing would likely leave you well over $20,000 in debt.	You don't get saddled with it, but the person's estate will. It then becomes the responsibility of the deceased's Will Executor to take care of.
What is a common misconception about Reddit?	That there's a diverse, open-minded population that fosters and encourages educated conversation. Lolplease, 90% of the people here are losers or techies in IT with largely centrist and/or liberal views who don't know much about the world beyond their own friggin keyboards.	When you read NSFW stories on here just remember that the people telling the stories are most likley not as attractive as you're picturing in your head.
What will you NEVER share with your SO?	I don't currently have an SO. But assuming I did and they were a keeper I don't think I'd keep anything from them. I can't think of a single thing I wouldn't be willing to tell someone I trust completely.	That she had lipstick on her teeth during our wedding vows. I remember thinking during that moment, "Huh, so this is the secret I will take to my grave".
I just realized the reason that banks have measuring sticks mounted by the door is to get the height of a suspect if they're robbed. When have you realized something is a lot darker than you realized?	The nursery rhyme "ring around the Rosie" is about the black plague. "A pocket full of posey" is the medicine they used to try to cure it. "ashes, ashes, they all fall down shows the people dying and the bodies being burned.	That strong blue/purple lighting they sometimes use in public toilets, and on public transportation at nights .. It's so that people doing needle drugs can't see or tell where their veins are. O_O
What do people do that always comes off as trying too hard?	Duckfacing, who in the name of ever loving fuck told these basic bitches that it was sexy?????? Edit: A duckfacing basic bitch down voted me lol!	When a salesperson uses my name over and over and over, as if they are trying to convince me to buy whatever they are selling just because they can parrot back my name at me...this forced familiarity drives me batty.
Historians of reddit, what are some R rated facts that are often left out of history classes?	Mildly R rated- Adolph Hitler requested that Sex dolls be made for German soldiers so they wouldn't get STD's from banging girls in occupied territories. The person who invented Barbie based the doll after these sex dolls.	Ben Franklin used to like to take wind-baths. As in getting naked, climbing up on a hill somewhere and just standing there naked.
What do you disagree with but respect?	Feminism. I think we should be all equals when it come to wage and opportunities but I'd rather have a 6'5'' cop come to my rescue than a 5'3'' if I ever need one and I feel like a lot of feminist don't seek equality but to have more advantages than men.	Responsible, fiscal conservatives. I'm a liberal, but I can understand the argument for personal responsibility and fiscal common sense. Having folks like that should theoretically create a nice balance in society.
people with Social anxiety (sweat,turn red). How did you survive job interviews ?	I have social anxiety but I'm still young. I haven't had a job interview because I'm in Middle School but I take Zoloft for anxiety and that helps	Instead of making eye contact, look at the bridge of the person's nose - that really helped me. And then I told my dad, and he was like "nose contact is better than no contact," so there's a catchy rhyme to remember it by.
What's the pettiest reason why you didn't go on a second date?	We asked to sit at a table that was half full of men in a crowded bar. After sitting down the men start hitting on me in front of him and he did absolutely nothing, nothing at all.....	She didn't believe me when I explained how centuries are counted. I told her that the 19th century is the 1800s, and she asked 'How does that work?' So I explained how the years 1-100 are the first century, the years 101-200 are the second century, and so on. Her response? 'Nah, you're having me on!'
elementary school teachers, what is the most disgusting thing you have seen a child do?	I was a student so... I don't know fucking stab me I guess but anyway the kid shat his pants, let a little, tiny bit out onto the floor, and tried to hide the rest in his pants... yeah... Also a cunt once put my hat in the urinal... that was pretty disgusting.	I took over coaching for a 9-10 year old's field hockey team in NZ. Partway through the game, I asked one of our players to take over goal-tending so he ran back to the goalie to send him up to defense. The kid in net popped out his mouthguard and handed it to the new goalie, who then popped it in his mouth.
IT/Tech repair people: what NSFW have you come across on devices you have fixed?	Nudes, porn collection (s), home videos... Actually had one customer who I got arrested for having underage stuff on his computer. Note: I didn't go searching or looking. Found during backup process based on filenames.	Had to do a clean up of a students laptop, student was part of the gamer club here and a known furry. Background was a lewd furry OC waifu he had. Folders upon folders of furry pornography comics and videos. Ill give him props on one thing, no shame..not even a droplet of shame, everything was in plain sight.
What have you traded for sex or what have you traded sex for?	Dude you have no idea. So there is this girl I am regularly fucking which in return gets money from me. Also she is living in my home and she takes care of the dogs and our child while I am off to work. In return she cooks dinner when I get back home. We even signed some sort of document to validate that arrangement, it's called a marriage license. Best deal of my life.	To help a girl get back at her ex. And I got a PS4 for $40 out of it too
Instead of bitching about EA, Why don't people just stop buying their games?	Because gamers are fucking morons. They're the biggest and easiest group of people to manipulate on the planet. A shiny fucking trailer and they go and pre-purchase a game they know nothing about. It doesn't even fucking matter what kind of game it is, you can fake the hype and the morons will buy right into like fucking sheep. They keep saying how evil EA is, but I know for a fucking fact as true as day that in a few months when EA makes a new trailer they'll hype the shit out of it and buy the fucking steaming pile of horse shit and be fucking happy about it. As a gamer, gamers piss me off with how moronic they are.	People do both. In order to lead to a boycott, bitching is necessary. Lots and lots of bitching. If everyone stayed quiet change would not happen.
Why do you continue living? Can you give 1 actual reason?	Because I'm banging this amazing girl that is married and in an open marriage, and shes amazing... No dates, not having to spend money, she supplies condoms, all sex and no complications, and its like bi-daily... I love it.	Honestly because I want to see what happens. Like a below average movie plot, I need to stick it out to see if it has a good ending. Plus I paid a fortune for these tickets and I'm getting my money's worth!
What was the greatest invention in your origin country?	British, where should I begin :P We have famous works of literature, many great physicists and mathematicians, most sports the world over were British, we invented programmable computers, trains, and many great bands and Television shows. Our best invention though, the empire, all it stood for, and the creation of many modern nations, the world as we know it, is thanks to the empire. (sheds one manly tear)	A village near me in Ireland was home to both the inventor of chocolate milk and the inventor of the ejection seat. So you know fuck your Democracy Greece.
What is socially acceptable now a days but shouldn't be?	this might be specific to west coast/tech culture, but casual dress at work. wearing a spongebob or bazinga! t shirt to work is so unprofessional it makes me cringe.	Putting pictures of someone else online. Once it's on the net, it'll never be removed. If you feel like that's not a big deal, feel free to upload as many pictures of yourself as you want. Espicially to /r/gonewild. But don't make that decision for someone else.
Trump supporters of Reddit, what is the maximum amount of melanin you will tolerate in an individual?	Huh, so calling people racists didn't work in the 2016 election, let's see how doubling down on it works in 2020.	I refuse to even use dark mode for the website. If I caught my kid using darkmode he would need to make his own chicken tendies.
What was your “How the f*** did I just do that?” Moment?	I managed to do a really cool trick with a hoopla and some kid asked me to do it again but I didn't know how to do it again so that was fun.	My crush saying yes when I asked her out 20 minutes ago. I really didn't expect it but she actually said yes.
Had to not laugh out loud when I overheard a GameStop employee explain to a mother about Saints Row 3 and the dildo sword. What are some of the funniest situations you have had to watch an employee handle?	This one huge guy was trying to get on a roller coaster, and he was clearly too big and wasn't gonna fit in the seat, probably bend the track lol, the guy running the show just ran to him shouting "No way sir! No way!" It was pretty awkward because he had to do the walk of shame off the ride.	Woman called up the vet I worked for, concerned about her bird who had been acting odd. I had to explain to her that her bird was masturbating with its fuzzy toy. So awkward.
[Serious] What is the creepiest thing a child has said to you?	I taught pre-Kindergarten (year before Kindergarten)One of my students (happened to have Asberger's) had a little friend that died. He talked to me about it a week or so later. I told him that his friend was with Jesus now and was happy, not sick...(Church sponsored school) He said "Oh, I know. the angel Bridget told me she in charge of the babies and children who die." I asked his mom and she said they had never talked about angels. I hadn't either.	Put this post up as well a couple weeks ago and was hoping for more discussion on it, but alas, it wasn't to be. Anyway, my son asked me one time 'who's the old lady in the mirror'. It's happened a few times, always in the same mirror the last time he actually shouted 'GO AWAY SCARY LADY!' I'll admit it freaks me out a bit.
Whatever happened to that "trenchcoat kid" in your school?	well he found me on Facebook, Stalked me for a while, mansplained some of my posts on said facebook, and wrote a bunch of novels about eugenics. oh and got a masters in physics?	There was two of them at college, man and woman both wore matching suits, they broke up in second year. He dissapeared she became 'normal'
What is something people take WAY too personally?	Everything. This generation is so sensitive I feel like Im walking on egg shells every time I talk to someone. You have to be very careful with what youre saying and how youre phrasing it these days....	Others opinions of them selves. I have seen countless people be miserable over letting the opinions of others control how they live. They either hold them selves back and end up lashing out or become far more miserable and never dig out of it.
What is the stupidest thing on social media?	When is the last time a successful friend has posted a motivational quote on their wall? The successful people I know DON'T use social media.	The sort of people who overshare and their house ends up getting robbed because they revealed they were going on vacation.
What childhood injustice still bothers you today?	Not exactly childhood but it happened a few years back. My sister's cat tried stealing my cereal. I'm still pissed about it and my sister always defends her. *sobs*	When the guidance counselor didn't offer to help me when I showed her the bruises from my step-mom. In fact, she called our home... and told my step-mom I had come in about it. Guess how that went.
What's the weirdest wrong-number phone call you've ever gotten?	20 years ago I answered a ringing payphone, the person on the other line said that they were going to be late for work, I told them don't bother coming in today, you're fired and hung up. I still wonder to this day how that may have affected some random persons life.	For about a month I was texting a random stranger daily. From what I could gather, the person I was texting was a young guy, probably 20 who lived in the hood, surprisingly near me. He thought I was a female and wanted to make sweet, sweet love to me. My very first text back was "dude you got the wrong number, this isn't _____" He thought I was joking and wouldn't stop texting, so I just went with it. He'd always send me a text asking what I was doing and I'd always reply with what I was actually doing at the time. This went on for a few more weeks until: **Dude**: ay boo wat u doin **drewba**: Just got out of the shower. You? **Dude**: show me gurl Then I sent him a picture of my hairy nipple and he never sent me a text again.
People who have visited the US, what is your 'WTF America' story?	That they keep posting this threads thinking anything further south of The Border is no longer America. America is a continent, not a country. And the amount of people that thought that me just getting there from Central America meant I just took a local flight from Kentucky. Seriously, there are like 30 other countries in the continent called America.	Driving in Florida on a sunny day not a cloud in the sky, 3 Minutes later their was torrential rainfall that lead to the road flooding and i had to make it to higher ground. Within an Hour the bright sunny day had become lethal how do people deal with that?
Teachers of Reddit, what is a secret you don't want your students to know?	1. Obviously, we have favourites. And the opposite of that. 2. As much and as hard as I try to believe in dyslexia, dypraxia and ADHD, I can't shake the feeling that if you just fucking *tried* you could learn to read and handle a pencil and calm the fuck down. Just *focus*.	I reeeaally don't want them knowing I still live with my Mum. Some of my students have already moved out of their parents place, I'd lose all sense of authority if they knew.
What is the stupidest thing you've ever heard someone say that has literally left you speechless?	Oh I don't know. Maybe that you can force yourself on someone else just because you are famous. Or maybe that you can just "Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything." Sounds pretty stupid to me.	When I was still a vet student, I was on a case where we had to amputate a dog's leg due to an osteosarcoma. During the discharge a week later I asked the owner if she had any questions, and she asked "How long will it take to grow back?"
What's the most heroic thing you've done that went awry?	I was spending Spring Break at Myrtle beach and I heard a pounding at the door in the middle of the night at the hotel I was staying at. I opened the door and this hysterical lady was taking and screaming about how she locked herself out of her room and her brother was in there and having a seizure. I ran down to the lobby to get them to call 911 (the phone wasn't working in my room). I ran back up to my room where the lady was waiting and I saw she was still hysterical. I told her that the paramedics are coming and the lobby attendant is coming up with a key. Minutes later, the attendant comes up with the key and ambulance also arrives. They saved the guys life.	I was at the top of the stairs at school, about to walk down, when suddenly the guy to the left of me tripped forward. Then, I was somehow able to catch him by the arm, despite my usually dull reflexes. Once he'd regained his footing, my friend, who was directly behind me, said "dude, nice catch" and raised his hand for some skin. Then, in some three stooges reminiscent antics, I turned around to claim my high-five,with one hand on my hip and the other in the air, and subsequently elbowed the guy I saved in the back, sending him careening down the flight of stairs and onto the tiles below.
What do you need to get off your chest Reddit?	Fuck you, you're whats driving our class and the Junior class apart, you're a giant douche, who can't keep his own damn mouth shut and out of others peoples business. Man to think I thought of you in a respectful way at some point.	I have some doubts regarding my mental health, but I am sort of afraid of finding out what exactly is going on. I do not experience a "stable" mood very often. I bounce around randomly between extreme highs and lows. EDIT: Thank you all for the advice and kind words. I will take it all into consideration and start making an "action plan" today.
Women of Reddit, what are some NSFW hacks every girl needs to know?	Funny how the male thread has comments about how to please women better and the female thread has comments about how to get men to please you better. Is anyone really surprised by the contrast in these threads lol?	If you can't have orgasms from regular sex don't be embarrassed to get a sex toy. Clitoral orgasms are normal for a lot of women.
Gamers of Reddit, what is your go-to game?	League of Legends, I love it so much and I really can't live without it anymore, I got hooked and it has really taken control, I CAN'T STOP!!!	Civ V. It doesn't take much thought per turn unless you're warmongering or just beginning, and it's easy to play while half-asleep or watching TV.
Excluding birth, marriage, having children, and anything else that virtually anyone can do, what milestones in a person's life do you consider to be true accomplishments?	Graduating with my masters degree. When I have birth to my children (I know most females reproduce but it was unreal)	Truly making peace with the mistakes one has made and owning who they are instead of wish themselves to be. I know some in their twenties who have honestly forgiven themselves and many more much older who have still not figured it out. Living without regrets is not about the actions one takes but about how one mentally copes with mistakes made.
People who live in popular tourist cities, what are some things that you wished tourists would stop doing?	Washington, DC- wearing MAGA hats. This city is like, 90% Democrat, and Trump acts like the city is a bastion of sin and evil. Which it is, but it's a bit hypocritical, you know? Plus, there are many great things about DC- the museums, bars, restaurants, diversity of the people, non-governmental organizations, just to name a few. To insinuate that the climate of the city is a "swamp" is a gross misunderstanding of the city. Wearing a MAGA hat means that you support someone who insults our city and many of its residents.	I work for the National Park Service at popular tourist destination in Arizona. Our biggest challenge is getting Chinese tourists not to stand on top of the toilet seats. We even installed signs with instructions.
What's the stupidest smart joke you know?	The chemist loved a tasty drink, but now he is no more, for what he thought was H2O was H2SO4.	An engineer and a mathematician are staying in a hotel in two adjacent rooms. At breakfast, the engineer says "There was a fire in my room last night! The heater caught on fire!" The mathematician says "What did you do about it?" and the engineer replies "First I unplugged the heater from the wall, then I cooled it by tossing a bucket of water on it, then I smothered it with the warm duvet from the closet." That night the mathematician is woken by a strange warmth - the heater in his bedroom is on fire! Pleased to know that the problem is solvable, the mathematician rolls over and goes back to sleep
How likely is it that all that has happened to "The Interview" is just a marketing ploy?	Not likely at all. But you shouldn't take off the tin foil hat, the government is still watching you. Don't wear green tomorrow neither, satellites will focus on that color tomorrow (I have insider info)	There is no way it is a ploy. The head executives would not release their own embarrassing emails. Even if those emails were planned and Sorkin, Jolie, etc. are fine with the names they were called, the Sony executives made racist jokes about the president. No way they'd knowing do that. The SS#s of employees were leaked and there is now a massive lawsuit in the works. No way they'd knowingly do that. It's not a ploy. It is a hacking combined with bad decisions. Oh and you know what else wasn't a ploy for publicity? James Franco hitting on a 17 year old girl.
People who declined a proposal, why did you do it?	Korean girl that had grown up in London. She had an amazing ass and legs. Parents had their own insurance company. So she was super rich. Had maids, multiple houses, etc. She offered me enough money to never have to worry about money ever again if I married her. I was tempted. Very tempted. But I knew I would blow my brains out if I spent my whole life with her. She’s married now. And the marriage starting falling apart immediately. From what I hear, the husband can’t handle her insanity. Of course I made the right decision. But damn....that much money is always tempting.	I met him at an art opening, he flew back to his home state a couple days later. We spent a month talking on the phone every day, and he asked me to come with him to Italy while he produced some paintings for a patrons new villa. I started getting everything together to renew my passport and prepare for the trip. He told me he was going to propose to me in Italy. I told him this was too much for me and I wasn’t feeling like we were on the same level in the relationship. He lost his shit, called me 50 times through the night, but after the first time I didn’t answer anymore. A few years later I found out he had gone to prison- statutory rape of one of his art students.
What’s the worst public break up you’ve witnessed?	My ex curving me in front of all my friends and my teacher after me saying “Yeah she’s my girlfriend, o b s e r v e”	Two teens broke up in the middle of one of the busiest malls in the area. The guy gave her a rose and then broke up with her infront of a mall full of people. Then he proceeded to hug her while she cried and begged him not to.
When I was five, I locked myself in the fridge because I wanted to "be like food." Reddit, have you ever almost accidentally killed yourself?	I once stuck a pencil in a light socket after learning that graphite conducts electricity. Thought it would be narrow enough not much zap would get through. Woke up across the room.	I shot an arrow straight up into the air. I immediately panicked and ran around in circles screaming until it came down (thankfully not on me). I was not a bright child.
What rap line/lyric is the most clever?	I am often reminded of the simple, eloquent, and very intellectual phrase in the song "Bitches" by the Insane Clown Possee: "'Cuz your ass is big, and your titties is fat I wanted to FUCK THAT But FUCK THAT I never gave a FUCK THAT, you put me through the courts And gave me genital warts"	I bomb atomically. Socrates' philosophies and hypothesis can't define how I be droppin these mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits tremendous, ultra-violet shine blind forensics...
What is your job and what does your day in the life look like?	Unlock the door, count the till and sell weed all day while managing my weed inventory and researching new weed to sell to people and sedate my community and perpetuate addiction. I hate my job.	I’m an undertaker and depending on the day, I bring deceased into my care from hospital mortuaries or sometimes during the day I will get called out to a private address or care home/hospice. Majority of most days I will be out on funerals, driving the hearse/limousine and bearing the coffin into the crematorium or lowering into a grave. I will prepare and dress the deceased ready for funerals and viewings. I will also line and fit coffins and engrave nameplates among general cleaning of the funeral home and vehicles. It can be pretty full on physically as well as emotionally, but I really appreciate my job and the comfort I can help bring to some families.
What mild injustice was done to you as a child that you are still mad about?	In 2000, when I was five, the supreme court made George Bush president. I say this injustice was done to me (but also everyone else in America, and loads of people in other countries) because Bush's education policy had a profoundly negative impact on by childhood.	My little brother lied and I got the whooping meant for him. My dad felt bad and told me I could give him a spanking to make up for the one he gave me. I declined. I was like 5 and figured fuck that noise. I wanted to wait until I was big enough to do some damage. I still haven't forgotten. I'm coming for you old man.
Reddit, what is your social "no no" that makes you immediately turn people away?	People who hit their dogs, even lightly. Edit: since there is so much controversy here I'd like to clear up what I mean. People who hit their dogs as a habit, or in anger. It is easy (for me at least) to see the difference between a good trainer and an emotional outburst.	People who brag about their temper. "You don't want to make me mad." Why are you fucking two years old?
You have 1 day to hide a pen in your apartment from a professional detective. He has 2 days to find it. Where do you hide it?	I go to every store in my county and buy every pen they have. I fill my house with pens as much as I can in a day. While he's digging through the 20,000 pens in my basement, the real pen I just shove in a bag of rice in the pantry.	As the detective enters the room, I say, "Good luck, buddy," and pat him on the back. The pen is in my hand when I do this, and so is a piece of tape......
What is the most outrageous thing you've seen another guest do during a wedding?	Me and some buds drew a big ol' dick on the back of the painting the bride and groom had commissioned which was unveiled at the wedding. All parties found it hilarious.	Overdosed on heroin. The groom stepped out in front of the venue for air. Found his cousin on the ground in the parking lot turning blue.
What’s your opinion on age gap (over 5-10years) relationships? If you’re against them, why? If you’re in one, what do you like about being in an age gap relationship?	y = younger person's age x = older person's age &#x200B; **y = x/2 + 7** &#x200B; Put in your year (either x or y) and solve for the other one. Example: Let's say you're **18**. If x = 18, y = **16**; and if y = 18, x = **22**. Your dating range, BARRING LOCAL LAWS, should be 16-22 as an 18 year old. Another example: Let's say you're **30**. If x = 30, y = **22**; and if y = 30, x = **46**. Your dating range should stay within 22-46. An example for the reader: You are 50. Solve for x and y.	If you're both over 18, do what you want. If one or both parties are under 18 then you better take a fucking seat because I'm Chris Hansen.
What has reddit ruined for you?	Classes. I don't think I've paid attention for a full class since I've discovered reddit. Source: I'm a student in class right meow.	My attention span. You can go on an imgur binge and look at amazing pictures, read hilarious jokes, learn some insane stuff but get to a point where you mindlessly click anything and barely react to it at all. Something I can't say happened pre-reddit
How would you solve overpopulation?	I'd be known as a monster but I'd start by killing off the weak, severely mentally ill/special needs, and prisoners (violent ones). I'd then limit the number of children you can have to 1-2, if you have more than that you and your family will be killed (incentive to not have more than 2). If I find that doesn't work, I'll have doctors sterilize some infants at birth (will be determined by family size/income). Edit: instead of 1/2 children, 1-2	Education. Time and time again we see the more access to education a developing nation receives the lower birth rate becomes. Populations will start to shrink as we see in the developed world. Edit: Grammar and adding words to make it make sense.
How is it legal/ethical for the Mayor of Boston to single out a private business because of their political beliefs?	If Chick-Fil-A issued a statement saying they were against giving black people the right to vote and Boston's mayor issued a similar statement telling them to GTFO would you have any qualms with it? Today's "political stance" is tomorrow's bigotry.	Those of us from Boston know that the only reason he had a letter typed up is because if he spoke it aloud, no one would understand 1/4 of what he says.
What wasn't as fun as you thought it would be?	Paintball. The first few rounds were great then I realized I'm running around in the heat with a bunch of sweaty teenagers trying to stain each other's clothes and take out some sort of weird aggression.	Working at Best Buy. I thought it would be awesome working in a store all day with technology, needless to say the realities of retail and work set in within the first hour and I never stopped hating it until the day I quit.
What's the most naive thing you thought as a child?	Somebody will love you for who you are... It's not True unless you're already someone or something exceptional no one wants to settle for you. And if someone does then they truly are settling.	I thought that everyone died at age 100, and under no circumstances did anyone live longer or shorter than 100 years.
What is one "annoying" habbit that people have just accepted about you?	i play loud music in my car, and will not allow anyone to change the station or the song. at first my friends would either turn it down, or change it if it was a song they do not like, after a year they have finally learned that its not happenin.	I say "Sorry" all the time, even if it's not my fault. Example: Coworker - "It's really freezing outside today." Me - "Yeah, I know, sorry."
What are you inappropriately curious about?	How many upvotes am I getting? Am I posting something witty enough for people to notice? Where's the karma? Potato, cats and Fallout!	If I walked down the street naked in the middle of the day, how far away from my house could I get before I was prevented from going any further?
What was your best alcohol induced idea?	Guys lets put a full pack of cigarettes on a 2 liter and take hits off of it... Oh wait you said best idea oops	I was super duper drunk at 1am and had to be up for work at 5am. In order to make sure I woke up in time I duct taped my cell phone to my head so I would be guaranteed to hear the alarm. It did not work because I forgot to set the alarm.
[Serious] What kind of year is 2015 turning out to be in your life?	Not great. Dated an asshole for way too long, fell into a depression, my GPA took a hit, and I had to quit smoking weed. But I've got a good job now, so that's nice.	Quite turbulent. House got robbed, job is at risk, mum getting remarried. Hopefully the rest of the year can be a little less eventful.
Ok Parents, Teachers, Camp Counselors, Bus Drivers, anyone who has to deal with kids, what are the funniest things you've heard kids say? Any notable conversations? Hysterical kid logic?	When I visited my child hood home, my child self couldn't get his head around me being him, but grown. After we talked for a while, me telling him all about my (his) life, he grabbed a clock, shook it, and shouted "HURRY UP!"	When my daughter was 7, she asked me what year I was born. I told her 1978. She replied *gasp of horror* "You were born in the nineteen's!"
Historians of Reddit, What are some of the freakiest coincidences of history?	I know I'm late to the party, but.... Edward II of England was killed in prison by a fireplace-poker being jammed up his ass (completely true). It turns out, later on, he was proven to have likely been gay. That is a coincidence; out of all the ways to die, they picked the only one he liked. Edit: Also, the Pyramids of Giza and the Pyramids in Teotihuacan Mexico are only about 10 degrees apart on the longitude scale.	Twice in seven years, the Mongols would have almost certainly conquered Japan, but each time the invading fleet was turned back by a typhoon.
NSFW: What was the biggest cockblock moment you’ve ever faced?	Shit happen’d last night bout to get me some pussy while my room mates went to pick up whataburger, as I’m about to do the deed one of my room mates comes in the room and hands me my food	Went to a party to try to meet some girls. My younger sister (16 at the time) decided to come with me, get drunk, push a girl I was flirting with off the front porch, and vomit on my feet. Needless to say, I went home early that night with no phone numbers.
What item you've bought within the last year changed your daily life the most?	Smartwatch. IMO these things have finally become viable and not just a proof of concept. I have a sony smartwatch 3. Simply put, anything that would come up in the notification bar of my htc m8 is forwarded to the watch, including music controls etc. Like most gadgets its not essential but its very nice to actually be able to read a text at a glance without having to dig out your phone and becomes abundantly more helpful when driving/biking.	An alarm clock that mimics a sunrise, instead of a jarring noise, to wake you up. It's actually made my early mornings easier to deal with, which makes my days easier to get through, which gives me more motivation to do things at home after work. It's been a remarkably noticeable difference!
I was in the emergency room last night, drunk and covered in blood, when I started playing peek-a-boo with a baby, and the parents thought it was hilarious. Does anyone else have tales where parents were way more chill than you expected them to be?	What were you gonna do? Run with the baby? You were drunk and bleeding how fast were you gonna run anyway.	When I was 15 or so, this little kid, eight or nine, on my bus route kept asking me to come over and play video games. We were the last two stops on the route so eventually one day I just stayed on for another stop. He said that he told his mom that I was coming over. Turns out he didn't and his mom walked into his room to find her son playing Twisted Metal with some guy twice his age. We went into the kitchen and I told her that he'd been asking me to hang out for weeks and that my mom would be here to pick me up later. She told me that he didn't have many friends and that I was welcome to hang out whenever.
What fashion trend do you secretly want to come back into fashion?	Having sexy flaws and imperfections and being an original rather than an airburshed filtered photoshopped surgerized b.s. person. Shirley Manson of Garbage described this better -- something about, women could be real and different. Now we see fake women becoming millionaires, sometimes solely based on how much surgery they get. NOT because of talent or originality.	Fucking huge sweeping skirts like those in the 1800s. I wanna make grand entrances. Edit: After this post, I realised life is too short. I am going to buy a hoop skirt.
[Serious] Satanists of Reddit, what are some common misconceptions about Satanism that you would like to set straight? Non-Satanists, what questions do you have about Satanism?	I have very little knowledge on Satanists, but I am led to believe it is a dark religion(?). What positives do you gain from having this belief? For example, Christians believe in God and Heaven for the sake of there being an afterlife, or a true meaning to life on Earth. As a Satanist, I guess what I'm asking is, what good does being a Satanist have on your life?	I was a Satanist/Luciferian of the rare theistic variety for over 15 years. In Satanism you have the philosophical kind (Lavey,Church of Satan), who really just follow a life philosophy that can be summed up by "do what makes you happy, but don't be a dick." In the theistic kind, you have the ones that worship Satan/Lucifer as a being of knowledge and beauty. If you read the stories of the old testament, god is a bit of a tyrant. See the book of Job for more information. The devils only crime is letting humanity know they have a choice, they can think for themselves. Yes you can eat of the tree of knowledge. As far as being "dark" no its not. Yeah most practice some form of ritual/magic/witchcraft whatever you want to call it. But ultimately its about living life to the fullest.
Virgins of reddit, what is the closest you have ever come to having sex?	Not sure if this counts, but I was fucking her. I just never finished so I don't know if it counts. She had a breakdown of sorts in the middle of going at it so I stopped.	Prom. My date and I were purely platonic and have been for a while at the time. We ended up having a good time that night and when I dropped her off at her house she asked me in since her parents were out of town for business. One thing led to another and I was in her room landing on second base until her parents suddenly came home to surprise her for prom and all that. Her parents knew me well so they didn't suspect anything. But since then we pretended nothing has happened, now that the moment has passed. Edit: After I graduated that year, my family and I moved out of state. It's been 2 years
Flight attendants of reddit, have you ever caught passengers joining the "Mile High Club"? What happened?	Not a flight attendant but....... Joined the mile high club, along with another couple. After a flight delay with our connecting flight, the last leg had maybe 20 passengers, 2 of which were another couple we befriended at the airport bar. We asked this very question to our flight attendant to which she replied "I don't see anything, I don't hear anything." Took that as our cue to head to the lavatory. Got back to our seats and gave a word of advice to our newfound traveling companions "get your leg up and bend over". Flight attendant then brought us over 2 goodie bags full of airline "swag" including a certificate that says "Airline welcomes you to..... THE MILE HIGH CLUB" dated and everything. One of our proudest moments!	My buddy had an airplane fetish and would often board planes and try and seduce the women. To this day he is a virgin.
What happened in the most awkward date you've ever been on?	About 8 years ago I met this guy on MySpace and decided to hang out IRL, so he picked me up one night from work, we drove around the mall area smoking a tall water bong in his car and listening to Ulver on full blast, then we pulled into a Walgreens parking lot and kissed, then he told me he was married and going through a separation, and then a few weeks later I discovered that he was the older brother of a guy I had a casual fling with a few months prior. Awk.	The whole date beginning to end was terrible but the most memorable moment is him saying: "So I think it's best if we have sex right away to make sure we are sexually compatible?" "Has that line ever worked for anyone?" "No."
You die, the ancient greeks religion was actually real, how do you convince the ferryman of hades to let you cross the styx?	I am one of the presumably few people who still actually worships the Pantheon. I probably skate by on faith. That or Dionysus helps me.	I'd go with the Dante's Inferno approach and tell Charon that my quest is divine and that he better not stand in the way of Zeus's will
Teachers and professors of reddit, what is the most embarrassing/NSFW thing you've done or seen while teaching?	Elementary school kid pulled his dick out in the cafeteria and tried to poke a girl with it. Shut that shit down faster than a black father makes a single mother. Teaching at a majority minority title 1 school in the ghetto makes you appreciate the 2-parent families, they're usually the ones with well controlled children. 7/10 uncontrollable male students didn't have a father at home and 3/10 lived with extended family and not with their mom/dad. Edit: forgive the people who assume racism, because everything is black and white in their popular narrative of current situations and socioeconomic realities faced every day by teachers of innercity schools. A little dark humor gets us through the day. Sorry for disrupting their puppies and rainbows view of teachers.	I am a PhD student who teaches undergrads. During one of my first lectures, a male student came to class 3-4 minutes late. He sat down in the front row, opened up his laptop, and porn sounds started playing loudly. He slammed it shut and put his head on the desk for the rest of class. It was so hard not to laugh and keep lecturing. Life pro tip for my undergrads- make sure you close out of the porn when you're done.
What are your unusual recurring dreams?	I don't normally have recurring dreams (as in the event are the same) but I often have recurring locations in my dreams; and most of them are somewhat "based" on actual places in my life but loosely. I think it's cool, and I can always remember, albeit vaguely, what the places look like. I always just enjoy waking up and being like "Hey, I've been there in my dream before..."	I have one that I am in a very shitty garage-like place and there's a gig happening. I am always in the back and someone offers me a cigarette. The person always changes, though.
Who is the most despicable movie character ever?	Donald Trump in the movie of real life. FUCK TRUMP! FUCK THAT WHITE RACIST PIECE OF SHIT! FUCK HIM FUCK HIM FUCK HIM!!!!	It has to be Percy from the Green Mile. I'd never felt hatred for a character before and it totally blew me away.
The Powerball is at over $300 Million. What would you do with the money?	I would go to the homeless shelter and burn millions of dollars while everyone watches me eat one bite out of 100 fillets before throwing them out.	Change my last name to Wayne, Start a tech company and name it Wayne Enterprises. Get married, have a son, name him Bruce. Stage a fake death at the hands of a mugger. Change my name to Alfred, groom my son to be Batman.
Chefs of Reddit, what is the worst thing you have ever done to a customers order?	Wow, this thread is terrible. Just a bunch of self-righteous chefs talking about how moral they are. I didn't come here for this.	I've worked as a cook since I was 14 (am 30 now) and have seen a lot of questionable stuff. But I've never seen anyone actually intentionally fuck with customer's food to make it unsafe or gross. I've heard it suggested, but it's always shouted down. A Man must have a code. However, there is one good story of revenge. A customer came in literally 2 minutes before closing, ordered the most time consuming, dish-consuming, pain-in-the-ass item on the menu, *and* was a complete asshole to the poor waitress who had already worked two shifts that day. Chef was like, "I'll cook it, but I'm going to arrange it on the plate to create the ultimate negative feng shui. It'll be delicious, but he'll be sad and will never know why." So we're not going to spit in it or something, but we'll fuck you right in the Chi.
Reddit, What is one thing about you that hurts your social life?	the mere fact that people somehow manage to find a way to piss me off they don't know i hate them i just smile and don't talk to anybody	I never put in the effort to keep in touch with people, so I'm always drifting apart from old friends
Ladies, what's your awkwardest nip slip/bra malfunction story?	call me crazy but this post needs pictures to compare to the stories. 'My tits popped out!' Here is a reference picture! *picture im imgur*	Not nip slip but the first time I wore a bikini I wore a little skirt over it, and right before I got in the crowded pool I pulled down the skirt to my ankles to take it off and it took me a second to realize I took my bikini bottoms down with it, it was mortifying.
Does it bother you if you make less money than your partner, if yes, why?	Yes, since women make 80 cents on the dollar and I work in the same industry as my partner, that means I must really suck at my job.	Hell no. I hope she makes duffle bags more money then I do. And not because “she is smarter” or “she works harder”. First because she is my spouse and I want nothing but the absolute best things for her. And second, more money>less money.
Hey, Reddit. What are some must-haves for living alone?	A quick look of the comments comes back with: **1)** A shotgun. **2)** Sex Toys. **3)** A Crock Pot. A interesting look into the american psychi for you there. Gun mad, sex obsessed but love fine dining. Interesting combination.	A can opener (this seems obvious but it's one of those things you just always expect to have magically), a good set of knives, and TUPPERWARE CONTAINERS, all shapes and sizes. Good lord those suckers are invaluable for the single person, as it is so hard to cook for one without a butt ton of leftovers. Edit for bad wording!
Younger people of Reddit, what can't you imagine doing without the Internet? Older people of Reddit, how did you do it and how much worse was it?	Pre Internet was actually very awesome. There was less whiny pussies. You actually had to meet people places and do things. I could type a whole list, but it was great.	I am 49. Banking before even the debit card. You had to go to the bank on Friday after work and cash a check so you would have cash for the weekend. It was also pretty common to go in to a grocery store and write a check for over the amount and take the cash. Maps. If you wanted to drive somewhere you needed to have a know how to read a map.
If you are fluent in two languages, what do your thoughts sound like?	People don't think in a language. Most of my thoughts just occur in my head. They aren't comprised of speech	You can swap back and forth. People say you make better decisions while thinking in your second language, but idk how much I believe that.
What was your worst experience sitting next to a stranger?	If I just say small town McDonald's, do I really need to put the rest of the details or can y'all pretty much get the picture?	I was sitting in McDonalds alone, and then, despite every single table and booth being empty, a man sat next to me, same side of the table next to me. He sat there with his soda, spinning his straw stirring his drink not talking. It drove me nuts and I left.
Smokers of Reddit, when did you start and why?	Ex-smoker here. I started smoking during my first semester of college due to the fact that I thought it would help take the edge off while I was dealing with my first ever break-up (which happened a week before school started, no less!). I was extremely depressed and didn't have anybody to really lean on for support. I smoked for a month and then weaned myself off with a vaporizer and haven't touched that or cigarettes since then.	Started socially when I was 15, mainly for the buzz and because it was cool then. Quickly ended up addicted and smoking by myself as well. At the time you could still smoke anywhere and there weren't the limits on tobacco advertising there are today. Over half the kids in school smoked, and you could buy them from vending machines so it wasn't any hassle buying them.
What's your experience with Sleep Paralysis hallucinations?	I remember being fully conscious but I couldn't open my eyes or move my body. I would start to panic until I could move again. Only happened 5 or 6 times when I was young, thank god it hasn't happened again.	When i was in the army i was sleeping in the top bunk when i had Sleep Paralysis, first i hallucinated seeing my buddy come in the room looking for me, approaching the bed and looking at me while his face slowly turned weirdly evil with long teeth, then hands came up from around the bed and started grabbing me. i was awake the hole time with my eyes open but couldn't move or speak. i was trying to scream "wake me up" because there were other people in the room when it happened. eventually they heard me mumbling and woke me up. one of the scariest things that ever happened to me.
Do you consider fussy eaters rude?	I find it rude, especially if you present them with food that you worked so hard to make and they don't even eat half of it...	i have tastes, and if i go to a get-together and nothing looks good to me i don't make them get me something i want, i just tell them i ate before i got there and silently starve. i might be picky but i'm not gonna bother anyone with it.
Elementary school teachers of Reddit, Why do you assign projects to your students that you know require parent help?	It prevents parents from being lazy about education. You would be surprised by the amount of parents that would just send their kids to school, and not have any expectations or cares. The problem you had was just that. Don't claim it isn't fair. Realize that your parents didn't care as much about your education as those other parents did. It doesn't mean you had bad parents, maybe you did and maybe you didn't, but it is an inescapable conclusion that they didn't have the time or they didn't care as much. Parent participation is a key self-esteem building technique in students of all ages from grades K-12 or whatever level below college.	My sister was given a research project with a presentation and a poster that requires use of the internet and rather specific supplies. She's five.
Americans who visited Europe, what was your biggest WTF moment?	Another stupid 'What is Europe like?' question. It's a huge continent with 50 (ish) nations in it most of which have wildly different cultures and people within them never mind between them all.	My wife and I went to Venice, Italy this spring for our honeymoon. We were in our room when loud ass sirens started going off. Being from the US, the only time we ever hear sirens like these are for tornadoes. It was loud and had different pitches instead of one, long siren. It really sounded like an alien invasion. Turns out, the sirens are for high tides and flooding in the next few hours. The hotel we were in had shin-high water in our lobby for a few hours. Definitely a weird experience for us, but completely normal there.
What has put a smile on your face today?	Woke up to my girlfriends period blood all over the sheets. It was pure bliss laying in her blood, rubbing my dick thinking of her menstruation.	My 2yr old daughter was holding her sunglasses and bent the arms in to form a triangle. She then said, "Triangle. Daddy, triangle. I made a triangle."
What is the most ridiculous thing you've seen your trainee do in the workplace?	i asked for ratchet for a electric box et bring me back a pipe wrench. After he told me that he never knew Rachet exist. The guy was a mechanical engineer....	Two hours in to a group training session for new staff: "excuse me? What do I do if I don't want to work here?" "Uh, you can leave..." "Okay, thank you!" *Leaves*
What's something you wish you could still find at the convenience shop?	Guns, like damn, yesterday I could just have my day and walk away with a lil baby glock, now I cant even have a single Beretta. Wtf	I remember random corner stores I'd visit as a little kid with my mom, and near the counter they'd have these little brown paper bags with a question mark drawn on them. The mystery bags would be about half full with suckers, penny-candies, a whistle, a spinny-top, etc. I once got a mini yo-yo and felt like I'd won the lottery.
What moment in your life would you like to be able to relive forever, whenever you want?	I was twelve, I finger-fucked the babysitter. If I had known that sex w/out pregnancy was possible I would have banged her. It still gives me a rager whenever I think about it. Edit: I mean wistful it still gets me wistful.	I used to start singing Superman's theme. When my girls heard it they ran from wherever they were in the house to "fly" with daddy. Seeing them smile and laugh as they ran to me....I'd take that memory for ever.
Older, tattoed Redditors: do you ever regret getting any of them?	Last weekend I saw a 48 year old woman with her sorority letters tattooed on her ankle. It was the saddest, most pathetic site I've ever seen.	I was a drunk angsty 14 year old punk and tattooed "Hate" on my arm. Took me a day to regret it. I don't think you need to be old to regret things...
Karens of Reddit what was your worst experience with the McDonalds manager?	I went to McDonald's for my daily salad and diet Coke. I'm a very self loving person, so I couldn't bear to get anything slightly less healthy. When I ordered, the cashier said, " Will that be all miss?" I lost it. I couldn't stop myself from battling these injustices. I yelled at the cashier for saying that, acting like I had to eat more and get fat. I asked for the manager right away, but the cashier just told me to settle down. I was kicked out. I couldn't believe it. Kicked out of McDonald's just because I tried to stand up for myself and all other women like me, who are regularly assaulted for weighing just 275 pounds. Unbelievable. (I know it's kind of obvious but this is just a joke.)	I went to a BBQ place and asked for brisket. They brought me a cup of Lipton Brisk Iced Tea.
In the US, you theoretically tip for good service, but really you tip because you know you are responsible for part of the server's wage. What are your thoughts on tipping?	Yes, it's an incredibly fucked up system that allows food industry to grossly underpay their floor staff. Go America, land of the free... if you are born into money.	I raised 2 kids solely on waitress wages for years. It was all about tips. If I didnt make enough money, I'd work an extra day or two. Luckily I had a good support system for child care but it was a super difficult life. Now, I'm an excellent tipper for excellent service. But it irks me when there are tip jars everywhere. You hand me a pizza or make me a coffee and want a tip? That's not how it works. I'd prefer EVERYONE make a fair hourly wage and we do away with tipping.
Why do Americans not care that Nike uses sweatshops/child labor but get pissy when Nike chooses a man who exercised his right to freedom of speech (which is supposedly a big deal in America) as their face?	Why do leftists not care that Nike uses child labor but want to defend it because they desperately wish that whiny loser Colin Kaepernick was relevant or heroic in any way?	To be perfectly honest, the people who truly "care" that Nike picked Kap as their rep is a minority. But the dumbest people usually have the biggest mouths so thats all you ever hear.
What does the "-ham" mean in place names such as Tottenham, Rotherham, Amersham, Cheltenham etc?	the suffix -ham comes from hamlet. Back in the day you had walled cities or towns where major commerce and city life took place. Then dotted around these secure locations were small collections of houses, with a small local community, called hamlets. They depended on the passing city traffic for what small trade they did, and generally lived off the land. As population increased there was less need for a walled city defence and urban sprawl began to take place. Eventually hamlets became a part of the greater metropolitan area itself. For instance now tottenham is a part of London.	It's old english for farm or homestead which came to mean village. Hamlet is the same root, which is a little village (that is, one without a church). It's not actually short for hamlet, the _ham_ in hamlet and Birmingham are the same though.
I sometimes judge whether or not I should purchase something by using a rationale of "if I wore this $40 hat 40 times, it's $1 a day," and then decide if it's worth the money. What strangely devised methods of daily life do you put your brain through?	If I'm trying to kill some time but don't really feel like jerking it, I'll browse /r/all about 10 pages deep because I know I'll start running into nsfw posts there and then decide to jerk it.	I imagine I'm getting paid to not buy something. For example, I recently cancelled my cable because if somebody said "I'll give you 40 bucks a month to not watch cable" its a deal I would take
People who gave their children ordinary names with weird spellings, or weird names that nobody can figure out how to spell/pronounce - why?	I gave my daughter a very, very old-fashioned name but changed the first letter. (My kids have the same first letter.) I just thought it was pretty and it had some special meanings for me. I honestly almost changed my mind before she was born, but her father really liked it so I didn't. It doesn't have to be obnoxious if you're cool with occasional mispronunciations and misspellings. I also made sure it translates to a common nickname if she ever gets tired of explaining her full name.	My wife has a unique Icelandic name and we have only met someone else with that name while visiting Iceland. Before our daughter was born, we were thinking of a different name that is more common, but still from Iceland - Stina. In a conversation with my good friend I told him we were thinking of the name Stina. He says, “Kristina?” I said, “No, just Stina.” He says, “Justina?” Realizing my daughter could have this very conversation every day of her life. “Never mind.”
What's your awful roommate story?	She was into witchcraft. Would do really weird things in our room and would result in some *really* bad spiritual things happening. Really affected me for a while and obviously the university did nothing about it because she didn’t have any physical contact with me while she did these things	I rented a room of this girl who was completely crazy. She seemed fine at first, but that quickly deteriorated. She would get mad if I left even a single spec of mess in the kitchen. This included if I was in the process of eating dinner and would wash up afterwards. She was really controlling about me using the living room. She’d complain if I watched “too much” tv or had friends over , yet she had a string of blokes come for one night stands. She also complained all the time that I used too much water/electricity; had 100% control over the heating and made us do washing together once a week. Needless to stay I didn’t stay there that long.
What was your finest moment of revenge?	Some kid deleted a years worth of work in my Engineering class in the 11th grade. I didn't even know the kid that well, but I got his name and started to dox him. From there, I did a lot of stuff. At first, I ordered pizzas, craigslist prostitutes etc. Started to sign him up for every spam mail/telemarketer. SMS bombed his phone for weeks at a time, rendering it useless. One time I called a hostage situation at his house and he was raided by the SWAT team. I had to do that from a throwaway online phone while using a VPN and stuff. Good times. He **committed suicide** two years later right after he graduated. I like to think it wasn't because of me, but the constant indirect harassment must have gotten to him. I feel kinda bad about it every now and then.	I ground up laxatives and tainted all my kitchen fridge food with it to figure out which of my seven room mates was eating all my food, while I survived off a secret stash in my mini-fridge. I found out who did it. Very, very quickly.
[Serious] Female ex-cons, what is prison really like and how accurate is it portrayed in Orange is the New Black?	Anyone who this OitNB is even a remotely accurate depiction of what a Women's Prison is like .... a very special kind of stupid. My Aunt went to prison for a little over a year in the late 90s. We would visit her maybe twice a year. It's really not any different then any other prison Ive gone to. Doors and bars everywhere, nobody was ever walking around unchained, let alone unsupervised. As far as some of the bullshit on the show it's just ridiculous. Yeah, an inmate is gonna drive the van to get the other inmate some medical treatment ... wtf.	For me and my experience, OitNB is wildly innacurrate. No WAY we were so unsupervised; not once millimeter of our yard went unwatched, none of the kitchen staff went so unsupervised, and inmates didn't have nearly as much free movement. We had pods and proper cells, depending on which tier you went to, but I've heard of other prisons having a similar set up (with the dividing walls) to OitNB. Happy to answer and specifics. I did 18 months in downstate IL.
What do you still own that's atleast 10 years old?	A book my grandfather gave it to me. it is published in 19th century. it is about astronomy. this fucker doesn't even have Pluto as a discovered planet. he gave it to me during his chemo session for lung cancer. i still read it from time to time as a remembrance.the book smells like earth and remind me of grandfather's village. :)	I own lots of things over 10 years old. A strange one though is that my Xbox 360 is now over 10 years old.
Non-Americans who have served with US soldiers, what is your opinion of them?	my ex served with quite a few, and all he said were they were arrogant with a god complex and lacked the skills to back it up.	Ex Royal Air Force aircrew. Always had a good time with the Americans I served with. A lot used to get confused by me being Scottish in the "English" Air Force but on one detachment I met an American with the same clan surname as me and we ended up "bezzering", that's what Brits call it when you are so drunk you and a mate are propping each other up while loudly trying to shout over each other that "No, YOU'RE my best mate". Bloke ended up inviting me to his house a few nights later for a BBQ and then introduced me to everyone as a "long lost relative". Barmy but brilliant.
For the people that believe the earth is flat… Why don't they just travel to the edge and take pictures so they can prove all of us dumb people wrong?	Well, a good think to note is that the contemporary flat earth model is more like a circle, with the north pole in the middle, and the south pole actually just going all the way around the outside. Imagine taking a ceneric globe and then taking the bottom of it and stretching it out flat. Kinda like that. Now I don't believe the earth is flat, but I've looked into it abit just to learn about it. And the argument that you can't just "go" to the south pole is actually pretty valid for a couple of reasons. Yeah, it's impossible to just catch a flight there. Not only that, but you can't possible travel across that large a land mass on foot. You'd certainly die long before you made it. And even if you did, it's not legal to step food on that fucking continent in the first place.	Because the people that do actually believe the earth is flat will come up with even more conspiracy theories to prove that their eyes have been deceived. It doesn't matter what they see.
People who have met a foreigner who was obsessed with your culture (eg: a weeaboo) - What was it like?	I am an American working in Japan and I would like to clear something up: I am NOT a weaboo, and I have never worked fort an English teaching company.	My ex was consumed with the idea that America was this magical place with no problems and we all live happy, problem free lives.
What is your biggest porn pet peeve?	* **Dudes who are loud or say anything.** Shut up. I didn't come to hear you. * **Camera guy who says anything.** Shut up. I didn't come to hear you. * **Girls pretending to enjoy it and talking dirty.** Shut the fuck up, you clearly aren't enjoying it. * **Preamble/story.** This isn't a movie. Get to the fucking. * **Anal of any kind.** I cannot believe any woman would actually enjoy that. I know it's possible but there's no way it's that popular. Instant boner kill. * **Cumshots of any kind.** Gross.	When the guy pulls out and starts masturbating to get hard again while the girl just keeps on moaning with literally no stimulation at all. I want to see people actually enjoying themselves.
What is your worst bee/wasp experience?	One weekend while camping, I woke up and threw on a fresh shirt. All throughout the morning, I kept feeling a poking sensation around my collarbone. I thought a piece of tree bark had gotten caught up in my shirt or something--but I was too lazy to remove it. Eventually, it became too much to bare. I pulled my collar down to remove the debris, and looked down to see a yellow jacket staring me right in the face. I screamed and swatted it away and ran to a mirror to assess the damage. 13 stings all around my collarbone. Pretty awesome.	Well, I have had several. I guess the worst was when my lawnmower caused the top of a yellowjacket nest to collapse, and most of the colony attacked me. It was so furious that I fell down trying to get away. But I quickly realized that I had to get back up and try to escape. I ran around from my back yard to the front door, but they followed me and continued attacking. The front door was locked and I had to wait until someone came to let me in. Each sting was like being hit with a red hot hammer. Yeah, that was definitely the worst.
Why do people move to a country that speaks a different language than their home country but refuse to learn the language of the new country?	To put it quite bluntly.... because they want their own little version of their country/culture in another country where they can better make a living. Pure selfishness IMO. Having their cake and eat it too.	As a child of an Indian immigrant, I've noticed that the communities they form can be incredibly insulated from the rest of the country, thus giving them the ability to live here and never learn the language.
What is the funniest way you have ever heard someone reject someone who was trying to ask them out?	Stories of women being assholes to guys who ask them out because they think they are nice and attractive? Sounds like a great idea!	Background: Girl was 22. Gentleman was 50+. "You celebrating your sweet 16?" "Why would I be in this bar if I was underage? Are you trying to make a citizen's arrest?" "I'm trying to hit on you if you're older than 18." "Oh. In that case, I'm not."
Anyone else notice how shit Facebook seems once you start on Reddit?	YouTube comments: Children arguing about shit they don't now anything about. Facebook comments: Grown-ass men and women arguing about shit they didn't bother to look up. reddit: Where you can actually manage a decent conversation for once.	No. It's comparing apples and oranges. On Facebook I share my fake life with real people. On Reddit I share my real life with fake people.
Teachers of Reddit, what do you think of shy students?	I fuckin hate shy students! Theres this lil fucker named Joey in my class and when we did the dodge ball portion he couldnt find his spine to pick up his balls and try to hit the other kids. So after being eliminted in like 4 games straight, I put him on one side of the court and the entire class on the opposite side as him. I told Joey that if he didnt get at least one kid out that the game wouldnt end! He never did manage to hit anyone and got a bloody nose from getting plastered in the face! I failed Joey and told him he would have to repeat the class!! What can I say, I have high expectations in my Math class!	I teach 5th grade and when I have shy students I don't call on them as much in the beginning but once they get more comfortable around me I'll start calling on them more often. It's absolutely awesome to see a shy student start raising their hand to answer questions in class. Usually when they do I'll walk closer to them so they don't have to speak loudly and then repeat their answer in case the class didn't hear. If I don't do that the kids will start saying, "Huh? What did they say Miss?" And it will embarrass them. Lots of love and praise goes a long way.
People who use bing. Why?	I don't really care what search engine you use, but if anyone ever tells me to "Bing (something)", I'd punch them in the nuts.	Bing Rewards... Something like 3 months of doing the daily challenges (which usually take less than 5 minutes) provides points which I can exchange for a year worth of Xbox Live Gold, among other things.
tattoo artists of reddit, what request made you go "i don't think that's a very good idea"?	Not an artist but was hanging out with when this happened. A woman comes in no older than 28 she comes and just goes "can you give me a tattooo of my baby sons name, inside is his hand and footprints, in a rainbow colour along with his birthdate?" She left without a tattoo.	I asked this to my buddy’s tattoo guy and he told me this: Two young girls come in with their mom, 16 and 14. They want to get their boyfriends’ names tattooed on their back, like tramp stamp area. Big letters. Said each one would be $3-400. Mom approves. He’s tattooing the first girl, 16. Decides he will try to strike a conversation. “So, how long have you been dating your boyfriend?” ... 2 months. Okay.. finishes first girl, next girl up. Thinks to himself.. should not ask, but gotta know... “So, how long have you been dating your boyfriend?” ... 5 weeks! He asked the mom if she was sure prior and her words were, “They got good grades and this is what they wanted.” He also mentioned that if he wasn’t so in the need of the cash he would have declined, but had bills to pay.
What innocent question do you hate being asked?	On a Monday morning - "How was your weekend?". Fuck off; we both know that you don't seriously care how mine was, and I don't give two shits how yours was. Let's just ditch the stupid ritual altogether - I need caffeine and nicotine.	What do you want to do with your life? As a 17 year old, I have no fucking idea. Shut up, Please.
What are some accidental NSFW moments you've seen in public?	A middle aged woman had her period in a restaurant and she wasn't prepared for it. She had a white trouser and it turned red. I lost my appetite.	When I was in 8th grade, we took a bus trip from New England down to Washington D.C. On the way down, somebody on the other side of the bus spotted some guy that was driving by, butt naked and vigorously jacking off. It was quite the spectacle when I was only 13.
Your friend has walked away from his computer for 5 minutes - What quick trick can you pull on his computer to confuse the shit out of him/her?	I forget the command, but there was a cool .bat file that was only like three lines that you could put into the startup folder. Every time you turn the computer on, it would restart. Hilarious times in homeschool! I was so cool and popular!!	Chrome, two tabs. Google "the lion king" on both. Images on one, save the sunset pic as background. Videos on the other, ctrl c "circle of life" address. 3 min left. Youtubetomp3.org, ctrl v URL and download mp3, 15 secs max. Control panel/sounds/startup sound Set mp3 as default. Shutdown and walk away. "Wtf my comp shut off" ..... NAAAANTS INGOINYAAAAA
Why do corporations refuse to understand that stopping piracy is impossible, and continue forcing things like DRM and the Protect-IP act when literally the only thing it does is harm *everyone* but the pirates?	Stopping piracy isn't impossible. In fact given the trend toward greater and greater centralization in the how the internet works it's almost certainly inevitable. Now downvote away because you like pirating stuff.	DRM isn't made for Scene people. DRM is there so that John Smith and his teen kids Jack and Jane can't get around it. You know, the ordinary folks.
If you went missing right now, what mundane but “unusual” things have you done in the last 24-48hours that would have unnecessary significance poured into them?	Watching videos of people criticizing Onision and I made a tweet about him. I guess he came here to show me, a filthy meat eater, what his vegetarian body can do.	The fact that after having hardly any money in my bank account I just went to deposited very large amount of my savings into it.
I just bought a lego set I wanted but never got when I was a kid, what's something cool you've done now that you're grown up???	Let me see - eat a tube of condensed milk - go on desperately needed ADHD medication - listen to loud music - play with play-doh Oh and I bought a board game like pictionary but it's called Lego creations and you build stuff with Lego and other people guess what it is :D	Entire box of Strawberry Cornettos and 2 litres of Coca Cola...for dinner. My 8 year old self would be so proud
If magic was real and every human was able to craft a magic weapon to keep with them until their death, what weapon would you craft, what magic would you imbue it with and what would your weapon be called?	I don’t like weapons that much but would make my own body a weapon with the same ability as Emiya Shirou able to project weapons out of thin air using magic circuits from within my body.	A knife, ‘cause they’re useful in lots of situations. If I put my knife down on a flat surface, it would spin so that the blade points toward whatever/wherever/whoever I’m looking for. I’d call it.. homie.
Redditors who are considered "rich", what is your story? Did you make your own money or were you born into it? How do you handle your finances?	Not 'rich', especially when you consider loan repayments and apartment rent cost, but in a good spot compared to many people I know that are my age. Grew up as upper middle class, with struggles when the US economy was doing bad, studied hard and got into a good engineering school with several tens of thousands of dollars of debt. 24 year old software engineer in a big city, at a company where entry level is $70-90k a year. With some early aggressive negotiation, I am hoping to get to a place where I never have to truly care about what my next raise will be. Just want to erase my debts and then live and do my hobbies.	I had a small company during the internet boom. We broadcasted live events online. We ended up getting bought by Yahoo and we made quite a bit of money. I grew up relatively middle class but I do feel it was mostly luck since internet companies would buy up anything even remotely successful in the 90s. I don't manage my finances, I've got someone to do for me.
What is a simple compliment that's very effective?	I can see that point. But I feel our culture tends to praise women mainly when they are dolled up. Making women feel they aren't beautiful unless they put lots of effort into their looks. Times I've felt the most beautiful were when I was in yoga pants, no makeup, and cooking dinner. My guy told me I looked beautiful. I felt great, I was in my element living my daily life and he saw the beauty in that.	In a work environment, telling someone you notice their hard work goes a long way. Even if there isn't a reward for it, people like know their work is recognized.
Today I heard a father say to his daughter "no honey, guns are for shooting zombies, not people." What public examples of parenting have given you hope that some of today's children are actually being raised well and by awesome parents?	My dad used to say "If you ever get into a fight, make sure you kick his ass, it's better to hurt someone else, than get hurt yourself" Seems like good parenting too me, unless your into that kinda shit.	Happened on the bus in early December. Little girl and her dad talking about santa coming, and the dad asks "so how is santa gonna get here?". She replies without hesitation "A DRAGON RAAAWR. AND HE BRINGS YOU PRESENTS FOR BEING GOOD BUT IF YOU'RE BAD THE DRAGON BURNS YOUR HOUSE INTO COALS LIKE RAAAAAWWWWR!!!" Father responds with "Really?" 'YUP!' "okay! what color?" Stopped paying attention, but he allowed his daughter to believe Santa Clause rides a dragon.
What's a big NO-NO when it comes to a first Date?	A guy asked me on a date and then didn't pay for my food. It's one thing if we mutually agree to hang out- then we should split. If I ask you on a date, then I should pay. But if you ask me on a date... pay for my food! Edit to add- the phrasing was, "can I take you out to dinner?" Definitely implies that he was paying! And apparently he thought the date went well because he kept texting me afterwards...	Strangely hasn't been mentioned yet, but don't be late! And added on top, if something does hold you up, let the other person know so they aren't just waiting around wondering if you'll show.
(Serious) In America, it tends to be said "just be glad we live in america, we're so lucky." Do people in other countries say the same thing, and if so, for what reasons?	I'm glad I live in America. Not because America is amazing or the best country in the world or anything like that, but because I don't live in fear of war in my neighborhood or any of that jazz. I'm not glad when people tell me how shitty America is, even though they don't live here. Sorry person from across the globe, don't try to tell me what living in America is like when you've never lived here.	New Zealand: great healthcare, magnificent surroundings and scenery, pretty up there on race relations, and cheap housing (in most places)
What was that one gift you always wanted but never got for Christmas?	When I was a kid my mom read to me a whole lot. There was this one book in particular that was filled with poems that I loved. I always imagined that I would read that book to my own kids, if I ever had any. When I was around 13 years old my mother ended up giving the book (and a bunch of other old toys) to a neighbor. Every year since then I've asked for that book for Christmas. I'm 36 years old, still haven't received a copy.	I used to ask for a $120 life-sized stuffed Golden Retriever doll from the JC Penny catalog every year. Maybe because it looked cuddly but I was afraid of real dogs. My parents saw no point in this. Eventually they got a real dog to my dismay but I came to tolerate him.
People who live near Time Zone lines: Do you clarify which Time Zone you're referring to when stating a time?	I live no where near a time zone line and state "central daylight time" all the time. Also, I'm a pedantic bastard.	Great Question. I remember reading a few times that ALL of China is on one time zone and I always wondered how in the FUCK that worked out in a country that large.
Australia is planning to remove all branding from Cigarettes, what does the rest of the world think?	I think it's a great idea. If you prefer the taste of Marlboros over Camels, you'll still know what you're getting. Other than that, what real function does the branding serve, except to associate the cigarette with an irrelevant image? Smoking Marlboros does not make you a cowboy, but the cowboy image is one reason that people buy them. (If it weren't, the companies wouldn't spend so much on creating these images in the first place). The idea that taking some colors off the box somehow reduces the consumer's freedom of choice is ludicrous--the consumer's ability to *consciously* choose, without being manipulated by branding campaigns that are very well designed by very clever experts to pass *under* our conscious radar, is actually being enhanced. What's really being interfered with is a big company's "freedom" to manipulate the consumer. And that's just fine.	I live in Ontario, Canada. Very recently, legislation was passed that prohibited the display of tobacco products. Dedicated tobacconists (as in >95% of their inventory is related to smoking) are permitted to have open wares but everyone else that just sells cigarettes and the like on top of other business cannot have them on visible display. They are permitted to advertise that they sell cigarettes as a product, but all stock is kept behind a grey barrier and customers must ask for them by name. The grey barrier typically has labels on it indicating the location of stock behind it, but they're just like 12 point arial labels someone printed off and taped to the barrier. The packaging is unchanged (although it does have like 15% of the box dedicated to anti-smoking ads) and requires no further action from manufacturers.
What is the absolute strangest thing you've ever seen a teacher do?	ugh, mine is so dumb my semester at university he forgets meeting with me all the time...i constantly bring up dates and hes got nothing. its really kind of sad, i really want to pass and im trying at it, but the guy lost any mind he ever had, we became friends, but he can't remember anything other than what the book can tell him.	I had a history teacher. Very calm, collected individual. He was a great storyteller, but he had a reputation for "crazy". During the entire first year, I had no idea where this reputation had come from. He was a good teacher, always had interesting stuff to tell about the subject he was teaching. Then we got to WW2. Without warning, he launched into a *perfect* Adolf Hitler impression.
What is the saddest reality for the upcoming generation?	They will eventually realize that they don't 'deserve' anything and actually have to work hard. But as for right now, it seems like everyone has their hand out waiting for the government to fix everything for them.	That there will probably be no Social Security for us, even though I get it pulled out of every paycheck.
What is the creepiest or most disturbing thing you know of that actually happened/exists?	People, in 2014, are going to church every Sunday and pretending to eat the dead body and drink the blood of some guy that lived 2000 years ago. That's pretty fucking disturbing. edit: uh oh, looks like I've offended the religious crowd! Yes, symbolically eating someone's body and blood is not at all bizarre... carry on!	Parents who rape their children. A close friend of mine has suffered from it and I've seen some stories here on reddit. Even hearing about it makes me paralized with disgust.
[Serious] Racists of Reddit. Why are you racist?	Live in Canada. You'll hate natives too. Ungratefull, lazy fucks who refuse to work and collect handouts from the government, and they all cant handle their alchohol or drugs just filthy addicts. They're always stealing and vandalizing shit, and they're rude savages who think their entitled to everything. They get everything for free and dont pay ANY taxes and our goverment will support them forever. Well never stop paying for what our great great grandparents did. And btw im actually not a raceist my girlfriend and love of my life is black/arabian i just hate that one specific "breed" of "people". Everyone else is fine in my books. But fuck indians.	Because I deal with the public at work, and after a while, you start to realize that about 8 times out of 10, people are going to act exactly how you'd expect them to based off of race/demographic, and anticipating that makes my life a lot easier. If I'm not going to interact with someone more than a few words, then I don't have the time or mental energy to try to evaluate them all individually.
Have you ever found yourself suddenly, inconveniently and involuntarily attracted to someone? What happened?	Had a thing with a chick, well her friend was attractive too (girl) and so we all were hanging out one time and then we all three started making out. Fuckin rad cause I was in like 9th grade.	You ever have a dream about being in a relationship you’ve never thought of in that way, and then you wake up suddenly overcome with feelings for them? Yeah. That’s annoying.
What is your G-Rated guilty pleasure?	You won't always be able to find it, but it's typically located on the front vaginal wall, 5–8 cm up from the opening.	Visiting my Grandmas, they think I visit them as some kind of chore, but I love just sitting with my grans, having cups of tea and telling them all about my week and knowing they are sat listening contently, enjoying my company. I’ll miss them so much when they are gone.
What nude scene were you totally not expecting?	The strip club scene and the sex scene in Deadpool. I was looking for a comedy not an awkward boner. Lol	Romeo and Juliet kinda took me by surprise. Mainly because I was in grade 9 and wasn't expecting to see that during English class. EDIT: No I was not in your class (at least there's a very low chance of that). Like 1000+ people have shared this sentiment, I don't know why you'd think I'm in your class.
What is something that you do regularly that you know you shouldn't?	I have now had sex with 5 virgins... My nickname is the gardener. I regret it every time because the girls always get so attached...	Not getting enough sleep. I know it's completely possible and I regret every day that I don't get enough, but I just can't bring myself to sleep earlier.
What's the dumbest thing you've ever spent money on?	A 24 month cell phone contract in my mid-twenties. These days it seems 20-somethings can't even decide what gender they are gonna be then you have me saying: "ya, gimme that 2 year contract, I'll definitely be in a position to pay all that cash every month".	I buy (kinda) expensive ingredients sometimes, and I forget I have them, and they go bad. Multiple times a month probably.
People who were raised by doomsday preppers, what was it like?	I'm not a "Prepper" but I have a plan. Go tribal and live in the mountains full time. I'm a Marine and have the skills/knowledge. Bonus: I won't have to deal with idiots at the store who need a full 5 minutes to decide what brand of peanut butter to buy and stand in the way.	Like others here, my mom wasn't a full-blown prepper. She's a woman who likes the idea of being prepared during an emergency. When my mom got a big tax refund a few years ago, she stocked up on about a year's worth of non-perishable foods, emergency supplies, and we learned survival skills. Although we ate all the food not due to an emergency, but due to hard economic times, it was a major relief to have something to fall back on when times got tough. Some of the weird things though, we had a plan to get to Canada, seeing my mom thought Bush was going to declare martial law.
[Serious] What plot device/tool do you fucking hate?	Deux Machina. Hmm no clue how I'm going to get out of this jail cell, oh look my dumb guard left a gun under the bed and the keys! Oh look a jet! Well I'll just quickly gloss over the manual and should fly like an ace. Omg the jet blew up oh that's right im wearing invincibility clothes silly me.	A shoehorned romance plot drives me up the wall every time. The thing is you can sense it within 5 seconds when the protagonist meets that "special someone" for the first time.
Game developers who have worked on terrible games, when and why did you realize the game was going to flop?	I was a developer for Team Fortress 2 which is basically a rip off of Overwatch. The prototype was really fun but once we received the final player models from the art team and saw that no one had nice butts we realized how screwed we were.	When nobody in your company enjoys playing the game you're developing but the designers insist there's an audience out there that wants exactly that game. And even external playtesters hate the game but their feedback is ignored because they're not the target auduence.
Non-Americans, what places in the U.S. do you want to visit and why?	I’m afraid I don’t want to go to the US at all until the Trump madness is sorted and democracy is restored. Hawaii, probably LA, Seattle (close to me) and New Orleans, I guess.	The Grand Canyon. Living in Nova Scotia (Canada), it's pretty much all ocean all the time. It seems so odd that there's such a large, dry space with absolutely nothing then this absolutely gargantuan hole in the earth. I want to see it with my own eyes. That or a Five Guys. McDonalds and Tim Hortons are getting boring. Edit: one sentence
Reddit, what is something every man should do at least once?	Coach a middle school girls basketball team. Lol it'll teach you how to be sensitive and attentive to others feelings.	Get outside of your comfort zone. Whether it be travelling somewhere new, getting up on stage, trying a new sport or simply asking that girl out, it's important to push oneself. For me, it was getting up on stage at a Katy Perry concert in Japan to ask her out while dressed in a full American football outfit. The padding helped when I was tackled by her security.
What membership is worth signing up for?	CreditKarma. The best free option for taking control of your credit. And they have Transunion and Equifax reports now... I don't know why you would ever pay for a credit monitoring service. Also - you're entitled to one free credit report per year. Which is all you really need if you have a service like CK.	Arbor day foundation!! For $15, you get a year. With that membership, you automatically get ten free trees. They sale trees and shrubs for good prices anyway, but as a member those prices are absurd! Bing cherry tree?? $13!! Hydrangea bush? $3.47!! Blammo! I usually get people memberships as house warming gifts :)
My unpatriotic approach to the Olympics has caused tension between me and some of my friends. Reddit, what opinions do you have that result in petty arguments?	The Olympics promote both sports and nationalism, two activities for intellectual midgets. When ever an athlete thanks god, it promotes a third.	My girlfriends mom is 100% sure that David Bowie also goes by Ziggy Pop. I keep trying to tell my gf that her mom is combining Iggy Pop and Ziggy Stardust, she gets soooooo pissed because her mom "saw it on an album she had a long time ago and knows Ziggy Pop is real."
What is the absolute worst mess you have ever had to clean up?	My wife had to pick up pieces of some guy that got hit by a train. They had to get them all. She was amazed by how well the teeth held up, they were scattered everywhere.	When both of my cats had explosive diarrhea. I came home to brown scooch marks all over the off-white carpet, brown streaky paw marks all over the walls, and two poo-covered longhaired cats. All on a hot summer evening with no AC.
What is not socially acceptable but should be?	Singing or listening to acapella music! A lot of people don't like this genre but it truly shows off the potential of the human voice. I'm talking to you Anna Kendrick.	If you are an interviewer for a job and the people you choose not to hire. Just inform them the next day via email. Nothing sucks feeling great after interview and then waiting for 2 weeks and then realizing that you didn't get any call back because they aren't offering you the job.
Reddit, via limerick, and without saying its name, what is your favorite film?	There once was a princess named Elsa Who sang lots of songs (but no salsa) Her heart it grew cold And her hair looked quite old But the kingdom was saved by her sister --- Edit: I'm not sure I'll ever understand why people down vote. If you don't like it, fine, just leave it alone. Anyways.	The pilots took ill very early So Ted took control with his girlie The wrong thing to do Was to quit sniffing glue I'm serious, and don't call me Shirley.
Delivery drivers/plumbers/people that make house calls of Reddit: have you ever seduced/been seduced by a customer?	Unfortunately, yes. By a much older woman while I was doing house calls for computer repairs. But that balanced out when I got hit on by a MILF whose husband was deployed and she brought in her computers for me to look at while I was busy fixing the other bajillion computers at the shop. She was always over my shoulder, even resting her head on my shoulder as I explained things to her on her computer, shoving her boobs in front of my face while she was waiting to fix her computer. That's probably one of the only things I missed about working at that place. I should have gave her my personal phone number.	i was a paper boy when i was 12 or 13 and on one Sunday morning i got a note on my delivery sheets that said "please knock". not an unusual request for a week day but at 430 or 5 am on a Sunday it is. Anyway i knock on the door and the door flings open and its a mid 20's early 30's woman standing there butt ass naked. from what i can remember she was really attractive but even if she wasnt i was 12...and thats the first time i saw a naked woman in real life.
Reddit, what is the most badass thing you've ever done?	i fapped, and not just without permission but i was also told i was allowed to. Of course i had to tell my Dom who immediately punished me with a belt across my bare butt until i cried and couldn't sit down	A guy at a bar was hell bent on fighting a friend of mine and I stepped in front of him several times before he decided to fight me instead. I dodged a couple punches and wrapped him up and took him to the ground and put him in a hold that he couldn't get out of. I did it about as gently as that can be done. Bystanders probably thought I was protecting my friend but that wasn't the case at all. My friend is a lefty with boxing experience and a temper. He decisively won dozens of fights in his younger days and is lucky he never did time. I was protecting the dip shit that swung on me, but he'll never know that.
Married couples who chose never to have kids, what is your life like at 40, 50, 60+?	Created this account just to post. My Wife and I recently moved into a 3 bedroom house, we have a bean bag living room set, matress on the floor for a bedroom set, a collection of every sugary cereal you could imagine, that lasts months and months. We travel, sleep all weekend. Save money for upcoming trips, drive fast/rare cars. And are the secret envy of all our friends who are to shallow to admit they wished they hadn't, or at least waited to have children. It is not a Woman's duty to bear a child, nor is it the high point of your life. Them growing up to not be psychotic or emotionally damaged is. We would prefer not have the risk or responsibility for that thanks.	My wife works full time and does promoting, so we see metal bands that we want to see here in Anchorage. I work on the slope and I'm in two metal bands. We have cats, not kids. We'll be 40 in July and August.
Bosses of Reddit, what the worst interview you've seen?	Backstory: This happened LAST MONTH. Me: "Tell me what you think integrity means." Interviewee:"Uh... I guess I'm not sure what you mean." Me: "What it means to have integrity, okay nevermind, just tell me someone you think HAS integrity." Interviewee: "Um, like, the president?" Me: "The current president?" Interviewee: "Yeah?..." This candidate was not hired.	I had to interview a guy for some contract labor and when I showed him our work vehicle he shook my hand and said "i'm sorry but I refuse to drive a chevy" and left. I was speechless... he was giving me the story of how hard he is having it I decided to give him a shot and because we had a silverado for the work vehicle he turned it down .. he has 3 young children ..
What are some arguments for and against marrying and settling down?	Think about your happiness over the entirety of your life: the saddest people in the nursing home are those that never settled down and raised a family.	Pro: it's very comforting to know that your partner will be there for you at the end of the day and is committed to sticking with you. You become a team of 2 against the world. Source: been married almost 20 years and we still like each other.
What's the worst case of computer illiteracy you've ever seen?	A real call someone got once: Me: "Tech Support, how can I help you?" Them: "I'm not able to log into the website!" Me: "Okay what message is it showing when you try to log in?" Them: "SIR, I am NOT a computer person so I don't know." Me: "Do you know which web browser you're using?" Them: "I don't know what that is!" Me: "Okay, when you want to go on the internet, do you click on a blue E, or a multicolored circle, or..." Them: "SIR, I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT I AM NOT A COMPUTER PERSON, YOU'RE REFUSING TO HELP ME SO I'M GOING TO HANG UP"	My dad once was playing with the iPad I got him and he was trying to figure out email so he could send messages to me and my wife. As he was typing a note he looks at me and asks how to make room between words. I asked him to clarify and he said, "when two words are stuck together how do I move them apart?" I figure he needs help moving the cursor in between two words but when I look at his screen all the words are stucktogetherlikethis. I had to teach him about the SPACE BAR. This dude worked in a bank for 15 years. I have no idea how.
Redditors; what is one lifehack/prolifetip from your job that we all should know?	Don't send your food back to the kitchen. Source? Chef / kitchen manager at over 11 places, cook at many more	If you feel paralyzed by self-consciousness in social situations, put your attention on the other person. Become genuinely interested in them. Even if what they're saying is boring, you can take in their mood, their energy, subtext. Probe them (not physically), everyone is interesting underneath. Once you do this, you'll fuss less with yourself and be more natural. Source: I'm an actor. Putting attention on the other person is one of the tools we use to "get out of our own way" --of course, with all things, you don't wanna overdo it and come off as a psychopath.
What's the sneakest/smartest plan you've made that ended successfully well that you're the most proud of?	Stole some ice cream bars. It was one of those guys with the push carts. Me and two other friends came up with this plan. So me and one guy went up to the guy like we were buying ice cream. The other friend who's up down the street, starts chucking rocks at us. After a few close calls, me and my buddy next to me tell the ice cream man "hey, you wanna get that fuckin guy" and he quickly agrees and we give chase. At one point the guy throwing the rocks goes right, we were out front of the I've cream man and pretended he went left. That's when our friend went back and stole some ice cream bars. He only stole like two each, so I like to think it wasn't too expensive for the ice cream man.	I was looking for good gift ideas on Reddit and I came across a post about leaving small gifts with notes around SO's room/house/car. Slipped a gift with the label, "Open in case of a bad day" into her bookshelf. The day after I did that, she called me to vent about how awful her day had been. I told her to look in her bookshelf. Gift idea worked flawlessly, and was carried out with perfect timing only 24 hours after I read the post. Edit: A letter
HR people of reddit: what is the weirdest reason someone has been fired at your work place?	This exactly the kind of answers I was hoping to hear! This is straight up silly. Do you know why they were so committed to keeping it in Klingon?	Not an hr person, but there once was a couple of guys at my job who were fired because they wrote the entire maintenance log in Klingon and refused to translate it. Edit: because it auto translated Klingon to Klinger.
Reddit, what's your "I'm sorry, I thought this was America" story?	As a Cali native it's the fact I need to know Spanish to have a chance in this shithole state.	I put my barrels out Tuesday morning for trash pickup that afternoon and brought them back in late in the morning on Wednesday. On Friday, I got a letter in the mail from my HOA with a fucking photo of my barrels in the street warning me that I was in violation for leaving them out overnight. That's how they spend my HOA dues.
What crime would you commit, if you wanted to end up in prison?	I'd try to assasinate someone important, then blame it on Allah / islamit extremists, just for the shitstorm that would ensue. Possible examples are Angela Merkel, Putin, Obama, whoever is Best Leader at NK, etc. :D	I'd steal a donut truck and use it in a daring daylight robbery just so that the news would show a bunch of cops chasing a donut truck.
Reddit, what was your "Welcome to college" moment?	A roommate and I stumbled back to our dorm after a drunken outing during welcome week and as soon as we got inside he collapsed on the floor. I was drunk and reasonably concerned so I went to get him a glass of water. When i got back he was still on the floor but had his phone out. He started playing "I love college" by Asher Roth. I lost my shit.	When I walked in on my roommate one afternoon, who was from the Ivory Coast, having sex with what was one of the top ten most obese women I'd ever encountered. He just smiled at me.
Waiters/waitresses of Reddit, what do we do as customers that we think is helping you out but actually makes your job more difficult?	There are times where I actually want my tables to hang out and camp for a little while. If it's towards the end of a shift and I see a fat, ugly family waiting up front for the next available table, I will do whatever it takes to keep my section full. If your server ever buys you a dessert for no apparent reason this is probably what's happening.	I disagree with what most servers are saying. The only thing that bothers me is when people take things off or load up my tray while I'm carrying it. Just don't touch it! It isn't always easy to balance a heavy tray of drinks and you will throw off my balance.
Americans of Reddit, us British people are constantly told by TV channels that new shows are "huge hits in the USA" or "America's new favourite". But what really is your favourite show?	Breaking Bad is the only one I really watch. The rest is basically shit. Some NBC comedies are tolerable from time to time, like Community or Parks and Rec. Louie (Louie C.K) is pretty good as well.	Breaking Bad, Archer, Workaholics, Game of Thrones, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and recently started watching/enjoying The Newsroom. Oh as for my guilty pleasure? Storage Wars.
Siblings of narcissists, psychopaths or sociopaths: what's your experience?	Those are lay terms for Narcissistic personality disorder and Antisocial personality disorder. And you wouldn't really know if someone met the diagnostic criteria unless they had been diagnosed by a professional. The terms are thrown around and used as epithets by people who have no idea how dangerous those disorders are.	When I was 10, my mom put a lock on my door because my brother started threatening to kill me and my mom in the night. When I was 14, he fixated on my mom and threatened to burn down our house, shoot my whole family, and steal all the valuables and drive away. That same year, (he was 17), he took our car and ran away from home for two weeks. We ended up calling the police on him. When he came home, the police decided that it would be best if he lived somewhere else so he did. As we were cleaning out his room we found hundreds of knives, a hand gun, lighter fluid, gasoline and lighters.
Brits of Reddit, how do you feel about sending American Redditors into a panic because you have a different Mother's Day?	In fairness, British people are hatched form the eggs of tea leaves, so . . . are they really even mothered the same way Americans are?	Given the ratios of american to british redditors, its nice to scare you lot for once: we often get drowned out by the roar of the states. For instance your clock change is a couple of weeks earlier and freaks me out every time.
Nurses, Doctors, and other hospital workers of Reddit, what are some of your crazy patient stories?	"How can I help you today?" "You should know, you're the doctor. I am a doctor too and this is no way to treat a colleague!" (Then assaults my 7 months pregnant coworker and gets thrown out by security.)	This is super mild in the scheme of things but it makes me laugh. Scene: Geriatric psych ward Patient: You are very pretty. Me: Thank you! Patient: BUT WOULD YOU BE SO PRETTY IF YOUR HEAD WAS CUT OFF?!!! Me: Probably not?
Who was the worst houseguest you ever had over?	My friends girlfriend needed a place to live while she looked for a new appartment, after getting kicked out of her old one. They both wound up living there for much longer than expected, and got me addicted to heroin. Eventually, he started bribing me with heroin to let them both stay there, rent free.	I was in kindergarten and my brothers invited a "friend" over to play the newest madden game. After they got done playing, the friend decided to go home so my mom drove him. While he left, my brothers told my dad that our madden game was missing! We spent a good time looking for it but couldn't find it. My dad believed my brother's friend took it so he went over to his house and what do you know, he stole it. He was banned from the house and the friendship ended. I never liked him tbh since I was too young to care about friendship.
Landlords of reddit: what do you wish you knew before you became one?	Remind me to check this thread again in four to six weeks, when the landlords have gotten around to posting in it.	1) Landlord's insurance is a thing and you want it. 2) Residential property managers range from adequate to completely useless. Each individual manager is typically "managing" a huge number of properties so don't expect much from them.
(NSFW) Prison guards of Reddit, what's the most disturbing thing you've dealt with?	In the deep South about 15 years ago, we had a very weird prisoner in our small facility. Huge black guy who everyone was afraid of, until you talked with him, the guy couldn't kill a fly. One day, I shit you not, he brought a stomped on mouse back to life. Long story short, he cured my infertility and my wife thanked him with cornbread or something He also got the electric chair	I knew a prison guard at Winson Green in Birmingham and he said the most disturbing thing about Fred West was how jovial he was. The officers kept forgetting and laughing at his jokes and stuff and then thinking, "Erm this guy sexually tortured his own daughter and buried her in concrete"
People who don’t use Adblock, why are you torturing yourself?	because some people only can use ads as an income method if I'm gonna wait for 2 more seconds so a fellow human could then why the fuck not	I use Adblock, but I don't want to! I want to support sites and creators, but the ad situation has become horrendous. Ads should be interesting, informative and creative. They shouldn't ruin the experience of using a website.
What's the rudest moment you've ever had with a stranger? How did you react?	When I was maybe 10yo I walked out of a RiteAid after buying a piece of candy. I threw the receipt in the community mailbox in the parking lot. An older lady in a parked car saw me and yelled at me telling me that it was a federal offense, felony and that I should be whipped for such a crime. She was crazy because she was also getting out of the car in an aggressive manner. I said "fuck off" and started running for my life. Probably not the rudest interaction I've had with a stranger but I never forgot one bit of that memory.	I'm 29 but look really young and my body type is slim. So, I was buying smokes at a gas station and the cashier asked for my I.D., which I provided. She says, "Wow, I thought you were 16." I say, "Yes, I hear that a lot." She says, "It must be hard for you to find men who aren't into little girls." I didn't say anything, I just walked out.
Teachers of reddit, what's the most immature or unprofessional thing you've done because you didn't like a student?	I would suggest to the parents that their wayward child be transferred to the retard classes, during parent/teacher conferences. Obviously I'd do it in a more tactful, measured way where I'd have plausible deniability if the parents became outraged at my suggestion. And there's little the parent would be able to do to complain about what I'd said, since the school would likely already have a long record of the child acting out like a fucknut. EDIT: Clearly we have a lot of shitty parents on reddit who let their "golden children" do things like poop on the rug, bully other kids or torture small animals. Your little golden child would *never* do such horrible things, no reason to be put into SPED classes, or hell even dropped down a fucking hole before they're old enough to be put in jail.	When I was teaching, disruptive kid got his PSP out during class one day. I naturally confiscated it until the end of class. Then he did it again. And again. During this semester kid had several written reprimands and was on thin ice with his parents. Around the 5th-6th time he did it, I told him I was forced to write him up for it. He begged me not to. So I didn't, and I took the PSP home and played Lego Batman that night. And the next night. I kept it for a week I think. He never took it out in class again...
Those familiar with the Bible, what is your favorite story from it?	Job. The story of how one man gets fucked over by an evil dictator for no damn reason at all, and then remains loyal to said dictator. A heartwarming story of pain and betrayal.	The book of Jonah is pretty cool. Yes, there's the whole big fish thing but I think it's funny how Jonah is upset that he saved the town of Ninevah. He wanted to fail because he hated the Ninevites.
A guy just showed up at our office trying to get his ex girlfriend fired for having an abortion, what is the most ridiculous thing you've seen at work?	The fact that you edited your post to single out a redditor that you got into an argument with makes me dislike this thread immediately.	Someone pooped in an aisle of desks. There was just a turd sitting there and no one saw how it got there.
What is the weirdest thing you have ever agreed to?	I once agreed to beat a cow to death in a rice field using only two small porcelain figurines. The police report said it may be the very first case ever of a nick nack patty wack.	I agreed with a friend that if I died young she could claim I had painted all her artwork, as she was sure nothing is ever popular until the artist is dead. That way she could see people appreciating her work, even if she wasn't taking credit for it.
What is the meanest thing you've heard a teacher say to a student?	These girls would eat toothpaste for some reason. I read the tube and it said it was bad for you. I told them it was bad for them. They giggled and told me to try it. I said NO. I told the teacher to tell them to stop eating toothpaste as it was not good for them. The teacher told me to mind my own business. The girls were watching me the entire time and when I came back to my seat they laughed and laughed at me. One is dead of an overdose and the other is almost there. Fucking pos bitch of a teacher. The girls were so nice and cute.	One time, my English teacher (who also directed our school plays) messed up a mental math problem and a student **who was in the play he was directing at the time** said "Wow, Mr. ______, you should have been a math teacher" He looked her dead in the face and said "Wow Olivia, you should have been an actress."
redditors, what is a common myth about your profession that you want to debunk now?	'All athletes are stupid and only chose a sporting career because they had no other options.' I'm a straight A advanced student and I speak four languages. One of the girls I work with has two separate degrees and is studying for a third. We aren't stupid.	Contrary to popular belief, not every magician has a beautiful assistant. In fact, the only time I make women disappear is when I tell them I'm a magician.
Besides the gif/Jif debacle, what other petty disputes are you most passionate about?	I am allowed to correct people's pronunciation and spelling. I am not an asshole for doing so. I'm also really not trying to somehow ruin your day. I simply believe that clear communication is vital during disasters and the more we practice good, clear communications, the more likely that we will all make it when the disaster happens.	I moved from an Aunt area to an Ant area. I now pronounce it both ways and it just changes at random.
Have you ever done something that has resulted in a sign being put up to tell people not to do what you did?	Several bosses have put up signs above the work schedule because of me. One going as far as placing it behind a locked display case. I'd always alter other peoples work times or write above their shift messages like, "Can't Jury Duty" "Brothers Wedding" "Dentist Appointment" "Daughters Birthday" "Vacation" "Nephews Bris" "Hr Meeting" etc. I'd add names to the schedule. Draw arrows from one name to another indicating shifts had been switched. Highlight names randomly.	Was a little kid. We went to this office so my mom could speak to someone and they showed me this cool "dinosaur egg". It was a fake egg they put on a bed of decorative rocks which the guy would tell kids it was a dinosaur egg. My mom was talking to the guy and I was playing with the egg and the cook rocks (which looked like fruity pebbles) ......I ate some and they put up a tiny sign that said "not fruit pebbles".
What is the absolute WORST Halloween "treat" you ever got?	Those stupid strawberry things that are hard on the outside chewy in the middle. Apparently named the most underrated candy ever. Fuck those they were gross. Edit: Gimme your address and I will send you all the ones I find.	A new family moved into our neighborhood from another country one year, when my oldest son was about 6. They didn't know about Halloween, I guess, but when they saw everyone handing out candy they wanted to hand out something too. They gave my son loose saltines. I felt bad for them, and hoped no one said anything mean to them.
People who pee on toilet seats, what the fuck?	She complained because I left the seat up so I didn't. What, do you want me to be a marine sharpshooter now on top of just hitting the toilet with my forked, morning wood pee stream?	I don't judge you if you pee on the seat. I judge you if you don't wipe the damn thing.
People living in democratic countries, how do you reconcile with the Claude McDonald quote — 'Sometimes a majority simply means that all the fools are on the same side.' ?	Thats why a true Democracy is always destined to fail. That's also why a Constitutional Republic is a much better thing. Unfortunately, our Republic is slowly being turned into a Democracy.	That is the reason Thomas Jefferson, in his first inaugural address, said, "All, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail, that will to be rightful must be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which equal law must protect, and to violate would be oppression." The Constitution provides protections for the people specifically for this reason.
Who else is laying in bed dreading the day tomorrow?	I'm excited for tommorow because I'm going to spend the day doing what I do every day: playing video games, watching Netflix/YouTube, listening to music, and eating delicious food. I'm an unemployed 19 year old and my parents provide me with everything I need. It's a good life!	I'm just dreading the morning. I have my last prenatal appointment in 4 and half hours, my due date is in a week and I'm panicking a little. I'm about to be a mom and it's actually sinking in that I'm going to be responsible for a tiny potato that cant communicate or care for itself at all.
What is the shittiest town you have ever visited?	Any part of Alabama. Shit state full of lazy fat people screaming "Roll Tide" while none of them ever went to college or have even finished a book. Everyone is on meth or heroin, full time jobs don't exist, and they all scream about how proud they are to be Southern.	Any of those towns that get their funds from speeding tickets (*ahem-any small town in Texas towards Lubbock*). Speed limit 75? ten feet later it's 35. Fuck off.
When have you seen political correctness go overboard?	ITT: "Why is society trying to be more inclusive and sensitive when I don't give a shit about the way other people feel?"	In class, our teacher can no longer use the term "brain storming" because it's supposedly offensive to epileptics, so they know have to use "thought shower". Surely this is going overboard...?
Grown-Ups of Reddit, What is the most embarrassing thing that you should be able to do, but can't?	I think I should be able to show up to class completely naked for a big test I haven't studied for, and not be labeled a pervert.	Sense of direction, I have none. I can tell you in my house which direction is what, beyond that I can't. Without GPS I am hosed.
What creeps you out but probably shouldn't?	Pretty much anyone that's gotten gender reassignment surgery. I'm sorry if I hurt anyone's feelings, I really am, but I can't help it. I get this whole...uncanny valley vibe from it that freaks me out.	You know when it's super dark outside at night and you're all alone in the house and you might look out of the window outside? Yeah, sometimes I think something or someone might just jump out of nowhere and freak me outtt, or worse yet, they've been watching you for a while through the window
If you had a button that would do only ONE thing of your choice, what would that button do?	Make my sister do whatever i wanted. I so want to see her in a tight revealing pair of lingerie so i can take it all off of her and fuck her tight pussy while sucking on her huge tits. EDIT: i should probably ask, does anyone know how i can get her to have sex with me??	It would generate the exact amount of money I needed (plus tip) to pay the bill that is in front of me.
When did you realize you had a privileged childhood?	When the mainstream leftist media told me, being anything close to a white male, automatically put me in that category.	Best friend & I were making our Catholic Communion and she refused to show anyone her dress, going on & on about it, how it was SO FANCY! SO EXPENSIVE! Family SAVED FOR MONTHS so she could have it, blah blah blah..... I never liked getting dressed up (proper tombody I was) I couldn't understand why she was making such a huge to do over a stupid dress; my mother couldn't get me to go shopping with her, so she just picked one up for me..... Communion day arrives, everyone tells me I've got a lovely dress on, I'm all "it's no big deal, just a dress, nothing fancy at all...." Guess who came in wearing the exact same dress? That's when I saw how much I take for granted & learned to appreciate stuff more.
[NSFW] Female sex workers of Reddit, do you ever have female clients? Other than anatomical differences, how are they different from male clients?	I worked as an escort for around 6 months, and dealt with almost exclusively female clients. I'd say I had maybe 10 male clients throughout the 6 months. The male clients were usually more clueless on the female anatomy, but that makes sense. The only other difference is that women often wanted to feel wanted and compassion, while the guys kind of just wanted to fuck, generally.	My mom was a stripper, and at her old club Tuesdays used to be bitch night... in her experience, the lesbians were always the most generous to tip, the most polite to interact with, the most fun to talk to and they always would bring flowers and polite attitudes. She wasn't attracted to any of them (she was married, and many came with their spouses) but she enjoyed butch nights Edit: BUTCH night, jeez... I swear too much for autocorrect to handle
People who can't say no, what is the worst thing you ended up doing for someone?	I went to a Nebraska Cornhuskers game with Zooey Deschanel on a whim. I ended up being detained by the FBI due to some other suspicious activity that may or may not have been related to inability to say "no" to things.	I sang two sets of songs at a crowded restaurant while my struggling artist friend played guitar and backed me up. He begged me to do it, and I figured when he heard how terrible I sounded at our "rehearsal" he would let me back out. But no. The looks on the faces of the patrons (somewhere between sympathy and dumbfoundedness) will haunt me until I die.
What's the most awkward moment you've ever had with a stranger?	I used to see this cute girl on the bus all the time on the way to university. One day, she got off the bus at the front door and I went out the back door. Had one of those "oh I'll move this way, you move that way" but you both end up deking the same way. Did it three times in a row before she smiled and I just stopped and let her choose. I always regret not following up with "hopefully next time we meet, we won't be going in opposite directions!" Funny enough, it was at the end of the semester and I haven't seen her since. Feels bad, man.	Without thinking, I once tried to shake an amputee's hand. He stuck out his arm in a non-offended way to show that he was unable to shake my hand, and to diffuse the situation with only minimal amounts of awkwardness. I, for some reason, took this as a gesture to shake his handless arm (it was cut off at just above the elbow so I had to really reach for it) which resulted in uneasy laughs and goodbyes.
What is the biggest issue you and your SO don't agree with each other over?	Oh fuck what DO we agree on. He’s conservative and I’m an SJW, so like, there’s a lot to inbox lol. I think the biggest one is maybe Islam? He believes it’s a backwards religion with no excuse for the way it treats people, I believe it is backwards in theocratically ruled countries because of the theocracy, and has room to reform, just like Christianity did.	Planning stuff. She's tried planning *everything* for the next several months because she can't stand it otherwise, and she's very organized and feels the need to control every situation. I, on the otherhand, just take things day by day, plan where absolutely needed, and enjoy the unpredictability life throws.
To the children of polyamorous relationships, what was your childhood like?	It was a little different growing up. I remember I would always have to stay in hotels with my mom as different guys came into the room every night. It was a little annoying because sometimes they weren't even the same guys. Then whenever we did go back to my dad's he would be really angry. I don't suggest it.	My dad has a few wives. I have a lot of half brothers and sisters. I don't like it one bit. He doesn't treat my mom well. I was always embarrassed about it when I reached high school. I never told anyone about it. Hope we can get out soon, away from his control. Personally I don't like the lifestyle but that is just me. I know it is corny and cheesy but I hope I find my true love/ soul mate one day. I want to have fun too.
Hey Reddit. What "polite " thing that people do pisses you off the most?	Asking me how I am. Saying "bless you" when I sneeze. The fake laughter people do when in a conversation.	Instead of saying what the problem is, they just beat around the bush and drop hints. No, I'm never gonna get it, just tell me!
At 2am someone broke into my apartment, taking the door frame down and everything WHILE I was home with my 8 month old. What's the scariest thing you've had to experience on your own?	That sounds terrifying. You're lucky it wasn't the police serving a no-nock warrant on the wrong address. Pepper spraying them probably would have gotten you killed.	My house caught on fire due to some electrical problems when I was eighteen and I was home with my 5 year old niece and 3 year old nephew. Trying to contain the fire from spreading until the fire department arrived and keeping them calm and out of the house was pretty scary.
[Serious] Soldiers of reddit, how has military experience impacted your political views?	27 year old Marine vet here. 1 tour in Afghanistan. 1 tour in Guatemala. Currently attending a four year school. My outlook has changed from wildly liberal to much, much more conservative. I will say that I really hate the incessant bashing of the VA. Perhaps this is because I filed no claims for compensation and thus I don't deal with them very often. I think people in general are whiny. The VA is likely understaffed, but good God they are trying. I don't really sympathize with the homeless epidemic. I have what I have and I don't really feel like sharing what I've earned. America is a kick ass country. Our defense budget is huge but that's the cost to be the boss.	My views haven't changed but I do now understand why the politicians in the UK can make such horrendous decisions for our armed forces, the majority of politicians have never done the job.
Shitty administration of my high school ruined a potentially awesome gesture. Anyone else have tales of high school politics gone bad?	People are way to sensitive these days. "OH! EVERYONE GETS A TROPHY!" Life isn't like that, people need to lose, people need to excluded, nut up or shut up. end/	For a satirical paper in English class I wrote about Abercrombie/Hollister selling nudity as an article of clothing (obviously parodying the fact that most of their models aren't showcasing any clothing) and my teacher told me that was inappropriate for school and that I was lucky he wasn't recommending me for suspension. He made me redo it and pick another topic. Asshole.
What's something younger people (under 30) worry about too much?	You *do not* need to take a selfie every time something exciting, interesting, or vaguely entertaining happens to you. Believe it or not, those events *still happen* if you don't spend your time posing yourself in front of them... and in fact, you might find that things are more interesting if you're actively engaged (instead of staring at yourself in your camera application). True, people might not believe that Erin Richards flirted with you (or whatever) unless they can see photographic evidence, but if you're that concerned with what other people will think... well, you're not *really* living your own life, are you? **TL;DR: Put the camera away and live in the moment.**	"The future is terrifying, it constantly plagues my mind. Where will I be in 10 years? Will I be homeless, or buried, or have children and be married or will I still be stuck standing right here?" That is what I worried about as a 20 something. Edit: I did not expect many replies to this. The quote above is from a band called Days n Daze. It is a song called Post Party Depression. They are a folk punk band. You should check them out if you like that lyric I posted.
What is the craziest thing you've seen a person do after getting fired or quitting?	repost-I was a security officer at a large aerospace company-- one that makes fighter jets AND the decks they fly off of (if you want to know). One guy got wind of his termination and got a large power drill and drilled holes in several aircraft skins. Now considering that these skins never cost less than $50,000 each, he did a lot of damage. They could not be salvaged, either. Another employee (who wasn't being fired but re-assigned to another job, same pay etc) jumped off the top floor of a 5-story building. The security officer who was 50 feet away from his landing point took a stress retirement; he said he'd never forget that sound.	My contracting company fired me for signing an employment contract with the company I was contracted to, starting the next day. They had security from that company watch me put all of my personal items in a box and walk me out to my car, and watch me leave the premises. I came back the next day to my old desk and put everything back. I understand that the president of the contracting company got chewed out for wasting security's time.
What's one food everyone seems to love but you hate?	I dislike those greasy fastfood pizzas that are loaded with shitty salami and fake mozzarella cheese, dripping fat everywhere. I know Reddit loves them. I'll rather pay more and go to an Italian restaurant around the corner to get a thin-crust margherita pizza out of a wood-fired stone oven. Costs me more and I might only get it once a month but in my opinion that's much better.	Celery. People tell me that it has nearly no flavour but when I eat it it is the strongest most bitter foul tasting thing I've ever eaten and it makes me unable to swallow it because my throat just constricts from the gagging until I spit it out. How the fuck is that nearly no flavour?! It tastes like poison.
Add "Harry Potter and the" to the beginning of a famous book title. What is the new book's storyline?	Harry Potter and the Chamber of AIDS Got that in a recent cards against humanity game. It would be like the chamber of secrets, except the secret is AIDs	Harry Potter and the Crucible. Harry and friends are accused of performing witchcraft, only to blame everybody else in the town. The judge believes them, despite overwhelming evidence that they're wizards.
WWIII starts tomorrow and they bring back the draft. Your number comes up. How do you react?	I'm a woman, so I didn't have to register for the draft but if my husband's number got called, we'd gtfo.	Well, I'm 44 and have already served so if they call me up, the Chinese have already established a beachhead in California. The situation would be pretty dire indeed.
What is something that most of Reddit acts like an expert on when in reality very few of us are experts on that topic?	Science, the amount of overly philosophical left wing liberals that collide in that section of this website make me vomit	Anything involving science. You can immediately tell whether or not someone on this site has been through the academia machine. It disturbs me how most redditors talk about scientists, like they're a collective of enlightened beings who have evolved beyond pettiness and bias toward their own work/source of funding. Scientists are people. Some of them are liars who will fabricate data and think nothing of it. Some of them are opportunists who will milk cancer research grants for all they're worth. Some of them will deny repeatable, verifiable data if it means protecting their own life's work.
I love seeing couples where one mate is more attractive. What weird things make your day better?	When I see a couple with one partner being more attractive than the other I think one of three things: (If he is hideous and she is smoking) * He has a HUGE member AND/OR * He is absolutely minted (If he is really handsome and she looks like a foot) * Her Dad is minted I have a very cynical outlook, don't I...	When I take a poop and theres nothing on the TP when I wipe. I'm always like "Oh you!, Asshole" :)
What is the most socially unacceptable thing about you?	My back and chest are just covered in acne. I have no idea why, I'm a healthy person, 14, 130 lbs relatively good looking besides the acne :/	I don't show it, but I always have to be better than other people at something. I get really upset when somebody is more intelligent than me in certain subjects.
What is something you realized embarrassingly late in your life?	Basically every Blonde Women over the age of 20 dyes her hair. Dark roots = it's dyed. They're all Liars...	I learned what marital status was when I about 18. For some reason I always read it as martial status, as in martial arts. I took karate when I was younger so on my first few job applications I wrote "yellow belt" instead of single. Edit: hey thanks for the gold
What small act of kindness do you practice in life?	If there's a long line of traffic behind me, I'll stop and let a car pull out in front of me sometimes.	I hold the door open for people. I also say thank you when it's done for me. I smile at people. I wave when someone lets me in in traffic.
What is the most ridiculous thing you have done to get attention from the opposite sex?	As a kid - walking through a patch of poison ivey to get a ball for a girl and trying to pretend it didnt hurt like hell	Climbed a 4 story dorm building to help her get into her room. We were both drunk and she thought she lost her keys. I had such a crush on this girl but we were just friends. Drunk me though it would be impressive for me to scale a 4 story stone facade to climb in through her open window and find her keys. Turns out her roommate was there and we could've just called her. Instead I gave her the biggest scare of her life climbing in her window at 3 AM.
What’s something that gives you goosebumps in a good way?	When the eagle flys around the stadium before a home football game at Auburn. There’s just not a whole lot like hearing 80k+ people screaming War Eagle. It’s incredible.	Music does it the most for me. Finding a new song that is so amazing it tears my attention away from everything else and demands every iota of my focus. I just sit there trying to absorb every bit of it, enjoying the shivers and sometimes even cathartic tears. It's a rare experience, but I'm constantly hunting for that high. /r/Frisson sometimes helps.
I once bought a "make your own hemp necklace" kit and tried to smoke the cord because I thought hemp = weed. Reddit, what was your most spectacular misguided failure?	In my early stages of smoking le ganja. I chose to sprinkle sugar on top of the bowl to make it sweeter. It doesn't make it sweeter.	I used to think I could suck milk out of my nipples with a straw when I was super young. I'm a male.
What is something that nobody likes?	Viruses, computer viruses, Comcast, religion/political arguments, malware, ads, mosquitoes, spiders, Google+, diseases, cancer, trolls, lag, power outages, flat tires, etc.	When your ear buds get yanked out of your ears because you snagged the wire on a fucking door knob.
What's your "I met a celebrity but didn't let on that I knew who they were" story?	I was driving my yellow Fiat Uno through Paris once and Princess Diana was in the car next to me. I didn’t let on I knew who she was. Kept the whole charade going even after clipping her car in a tunnel.	My mom yelled at Pierce Brosnan. She and my dad were at a ski resort getting lunch. My mother gets quite hangry (an unfortunate trait I inherited) and was waiting in line to order. Right as she's about to order a guy tried to cut in front of her and interrupt her. She snapped and told him to go to the back of the line like everyone else. She got her food and went back to my dad sitting there mouth wide open in shock. "Do you know who that was?" "No?!" "That was Pierce Brosnan. You just yelled at James bond" "Well he shouldn't have tried to cut me"
What is your biggest "wait, why the heck did I do this" auto-pilot moment?	I used to deliver pizza and get super stoned while doing so. I would zone out while listening to music and totally forget where I was. I wouldn't if I was on the way to the house or back to the pizza shop. I would always start driving towards my house or something	Was filling up a salt shaker over the sink so I didn't spill any salt anywhere. As soon as I filled up the salt shaker I immediately turned it over and dumped all the salt in the sink. It was extremely deliberate and I have no idea why I did it.
What was your first "Shit just got real" moment where you thought you might actually die?	During a mosh pit at a Kanye concert a few weeks ago. For reference, I'm 5'1 and 115 pounds. Somehow, (this was a festival, so no assigned seats) I ended up surrounded by some large guys. When Part 2 came on and Panda started blaring, EVERYONE surged forward and I came close to being trampled a few times. And don't even get me started on what it felt like to be in there during Ni**as in Paris. Chaos. I genuinely thought I was going to die. In fact, after we got out, some stranger who had been holding on to me found me again just to say "I'm pretty sure I saved your life a couple of times back there." If he hadn't been holding on I would have absolutely been hurt. Thanks nice Kanye fan.	I had autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, and was thinking how nice it was that everyone was visiting me in ICU, even relatives I'd not seen for years. Then I realised they were all coming because there was a high chance of me checking out.
Redditors who have jobs that require you to go in other people's homes, what's the weirdest thing you've ever seen?	I'm a makeup artist. When I go into clients' houses they're often very wealthy. I was let in by my client's husband and somehow; my back had been turned to the room he had displayed all his stuffed hunting conquests and when I turned to follow him... I fucking damn near faceplanted into Zombie Simba and almost shit myself. No kidding; a full grown young adult male lion ; mane and all, just posed ready to maul....I was horrified . It disgusts me that people murder animals like this..it's so majestic .... Traumatized for life.	Human shit on the floor. Also there were two entrances inside, one in the kitchen and one at the living room. The one that came through the kitchen seemed like the logical one from the outside but it was completely blocked with random crap. Couch was filthy covered in random black smudges, like gum on the sidewalk. Floor was filthy. Crumbs covering everything. Three small boys all under the age of 6, all wearing diapers. Filthy fucking filthy place. Had a therapist quit after one visit when apparently the oldest boy pulled off his diaper and started wiping shit in her hair. Also remember a house with a china cabinet full of random figurines. Like Disneyland souvenirs but random whatever. That kid had a sweet ass toy vacuum though, so that was what was most important.
War veterans of reddit, do you find it difficult to play video games that simulate combat?	Just a little. Only since I have had the time to play them all day every day for years like some of the people I know. O.o you know who you are.	Not a bit. I actually like them a lot, until I realize it's 2 am and I have to leave for work in 4 hours. My real gaming passion is RPGs though, I love solving problems and completing tasks.
What sequence of events in life led you to where you are now?	Bullied all throughout middle school and high school. Self harm. Tried suicide. Mental hospital for a week. Parents divorced. Raped twice at different parties. "Friends" all stop talking to me after I got raped because I "changed" Eating disorder. Bullying stops, now I'm in college. Get a cat and make new (and better) friends. Get a part time job while going to school. I don't self harm anymore, but I still have that eating disorder whoops. I plan on getting my masters after I get my bachelors and become a therapist.	My parents signed the permission slip to play the violin when I was in 4th grade. Now I'm almost 30 and a professional musician.
Leftists, what's your favourite right-wing policy? Rightists, what's your favourite of the left?	I’m about as far left as you can get, so it’s really hard to find something I like about the right. But if I had to pick I would say how well they tend to stick together, and have a unified message. It’s a horrid, terrible message in my opinion that will hurt many people and groups I care about, but damn if they aren’t good about staying on brand. The left needs to learn to stick together, and not split over minor differences. You can’t get any of your ideas put into practice when you can’t agree to work together and stick together more. And also fight more, we have the better ideas, fight for them.	I'm liberal but I think our welfare system needs major reform after working for a company that employs a lot of low income workers for the last few years. You hit a point where for every dollar you earn, you lose 2 dollars in benefits. So you have to turn down extra shifts, turn down promotions and make management think you're just a lazy bum who wants to leech off their tax dollars. I really can't blame them though, I wouldn't pay to go to work either. The point should be to help people lift themselves out of poverty, not bribe them to stay poor.
What's the most awkward thing you had to quickly explain to a stranger?	I (a fairly conservative Christian) did not get knocked up by my boyfriend, I was just in disguise for a dorm event. Details: I was an Resident Advisor at my university, and organized a "Character Scavenger hunt" where I and the other RAs got dressed up in disguises and hid in a public area. The residents had to try to find us, and whoever found us all first won a prize. My disguise (which actually looked pretty authentic) was a pregnant woman pushing a stroller, and my boyfriend came along with me. While we were out, we ran into an old acquaintance of his from high school, and my boyfriend said absolutely nothing about me being dressed up. So I had to jump in to make sure rumors didn't get spread around our small town.	That the little 3 year old girl crying and yelling "YOU'RE NOT DADDY" was my niece and I REALLY wanted my sister to come back from the restroom right then.
Do you think it's possible for a celebrity to be an active serial killer? Which celebrity would you be least surprised to find out that they were?	Definitely Hilary Clinton. She's got a hitman and everything. There was a body found in a dumpster that had carpet fibers on its back that matched her personal apartment.	I've always said that Benicio Del Toro is the last celebrity I would ever want to fight because he looks like the kind of guy that would slash someone's throat in a bar fight.
What was something illegal you saw your parents doing as kid, but didn't realize it was illegal until you got older?	my dad had this thing he liked to do when I was younger and I didn't realise that it was illegal until I was a grown man. what he used to do was take a set of jumper cables and beat the shit of me with them. turns out its illegal, who knew?	My dad used to pirate movies so we could watch them without having to go to the theater. I didn't realize this was illegal until I started pirating music.
[Serious] How are Japanese students taught about the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki?	Japanese soldiers killed a lot more civilians with bullets and bayonets during the course of the Nanking massacre than both atomic bombs combined. an estimated 30 million Chinese civilians were murdered during the Japanese occupation of China. other Japanese occupied territories also suffered from Japanese imperialism. philipines, Guam, Thailand.	I'm japanese in Japan In my student days, There was a few teacher who experiented nuclear bomb in Nagasaki. Those men have no physical defects but see flash light, blast wave, fire and mountain of body. However it seem that radioactivity is much more horrible. In those day, marriage rate in Japain is high. But there are many case rejection of marriage because of fear of effect of children's congenital anomaly. Honestly, living man have greater impact for me than book.
Hey Reddit - What's one character you cannot stand from a show or movie you otherwise enjoy?	Tobias from Arrested Development. It's like his only personality trait is "might be a homosexual". Maybe it's the Internet regurgitating his lines all the time but I got sick of his character really quickly (which is a shame cos I love David Cross otherwise)	That weird fake guy that they tried to replace eric with in the last season of that 70's show. fuck that guy.
Men, what are some things girls think you don't notice, but you do?	We notice when some women take their makeup off and look like a completely different person. We find it greatly disturbing and wish women would stop with all the makeup.	Every time you touch us. Like a touch on the arm or a playful punch. Guys rarely touch each other and when we do, it is not gentle. It's rare enough that when a girl touches you in a way that is not maternal, it makes an impression.
People with sleep paralysis - what kind of stuff have you seen?	I was walking down a hallway. I looked into one room. There was a lamp on with a fully made bed. The carpet and blanket were both a very boring brown. The bathroom beside it had the door closed. The light was off and water was pouring from underneath. I could see and hear the static that only comes from a TV with no signal. I remember thinking that I was possessed by a dark power, and I keep trying so hard to open my eyes. They felt glued shut like maybe someone had literally glued them shut. I woke up finally feeling very dazed after minutes of trying to open my eyes physically. I RAN LIKE HELL out of the room lol.	I've had sleep paralysis for a long time and I've seen quite a few things. Once I saw a "Shadow" baby who trapped me on my back unable to move. Another time I was pinned down by giant human thighs and often times mundane things like blankets or pillows caused me to be unable to move or speak. The "shadow" baby was by far the scariest one. I should note that I have sleep paralysis VERY often, sometimes even every day for a week. It sucks really.
Doctors of reddit, what is your most surprising "I can't believe I need to have this conversation with an adult," story?	That going out to dinner and a movie with your ex-bf is a date and is kinda fucked up when you're with someone else. EDIT: Lmao. *Totally* didn't see the "Doctors of reddit" part. Guess I'm still not over it. Thanks for being nice about it everyone.	Paramedic here. Was driving with my partner and patient in the back. Patient was fine. Patient's skeezy boyfriend was riding in the front with me and apparently saw a golden opportunity to ask a question that had obviously been on his mind for some time. Him: So when cats and dogs eat grass, that means they have cancer, right? Me: Ummm. No. No it does not. Made for an awkwardly silent ride the rest of the way.
Without being immoral or unethical, how could you use invisibility to benefit yourself?	If I go in place I should'nt be, I could get some secret information. After that, I could sell them or blackmail the people concerned. It's not straight up theft right?	Honestly it would just make the walk home much easier with less of a chance of getting mugged. I'm sure even if I was invisible, some mugger would inadvertently run into me and I'd lose my wallet.
What do you embarrassingly not know how to do, that everyone else seems to?	Smoking. I can't help but look like a **nerd** every single time I try to smoke... I cough, my eyes get watery, my throat scratches...	I can't gift-wrap a box very well. My wife's presents to me look like they were professionally done at high-end department stores, whereas my gifts to her look like a kid's arts and crafts project. I'm very handy around the house as well, but this task still eludes me.
If High Fuel Prices Are The Cause of High Food Prices, As We Are Told, Then When Are Food Prices Going To Plummet Like Gasoline Has?	1) Stop Writing Like This, It's Obnoxious. Capitals are meant for the beginning of sentences and for names. 2) High gas is only one of the reasons for high food prices because of delivery but there are other factors, the likelihood of a major price drop is very slim.	The current high prices for milk and beef in the usa are more related to the ongoing drought in several production areas rather than the price of fuel. Also remember that gasoline is under $2/gallon but diesel fuel is much more expensive still and most farm equipment runs off diesel.
What did that kid from your school do to get expelled?	Brought a gun into school,he held a teacher hostage and me and 2 other students tackled him.One other student pointed the gun at him till people came. He was permanently excluded and that's on his record.	In 5th grade we had five bomb threats. This red neck girl got kicked out after getting caught red handed writing the sixth one. As a 5th grader I was pissed off after the first two. It was an extremely late start to the summer.
Teenage boys/girls at girls only/boys only schools, what is something that mixed school students wouldn't experience?	I'm going to be honest, I clicked this for hot all girl action stories (over 18,hi Chris). I'm disappointed, not even a pyjama pillow fight.	Cheerleading squad without a football team. Dances with "brother" high schools. I think we had one men's bathroom for every 4 women's bathrooms.
Cashiers of Reddit, what products make you silently judge the persons who buy them?	I work at a university snack shack. It's so depressing watching the cute girls come in at the beginning of the year and by junk food. By the end they're not so hot.... Edit: you down-vote me for being judgmental when that's what the post asks. kay.	Had a teenage girl come in with several members of her family. They all came up to the counter practically in tears and bought a pregnancy test. She then went into our bathroom to take the test, which I thought was odd. Seems like the kinda thing you'd do in the sanctity of your own home. Then the girl comes out, bawling, and then her family starts bawling and they're making a huge scene in the middle of my store. It was super duper awkward.
What is your favorite subtle insult?	The best part of you ran down the crack of your mom's ass and left a stain on the sheet.	Them: 'I'll see you later' Me: 'Not if I see you first!' people normally don't get this one **edit - I'm glad to have enlightened so many people, now run free and use what you have learnt**
I've recently become homeless, and live out of my BMW. Reddit, in what ways have your life turned you into a walking joke?	Also, I'm an atheist. My last birthday I spent at a Michael W Smith concert because I was in my schools A Capella choir and we performed onstage before hand and got free tickets. Some kind of sick joke.	I hope you get to see this.. I am a college kid in Vermont living in a big house with some friends. Well we have plenty of couch space and do the whole couch surfing thing. If you need a place to stay just PM me, our door is always open my man.
What scares you more than anything?	I've said this before, Ouija Boards. I'm not superstitious but my mom told me story when I was a young kid that makes me lose my mind about them. I tell my roommates and girls I've dated if they ever bring or use them near me that will be the end of our relationship. I once yelled at a toy store manager for selling them with other 'toys'. Those things aren't toys. They're evil. Edit: they're not toys TO ME, they're objects that upset me greatly regardless of their actual supposed 'supernatural' qualities.	Mountain lions. Fucking NOPE. I'm a wildlife biologist and that's the only species I would flat out NOT work with no matter how much money you pay me.
So someone started a prank war with me at work. What are some of the best workplace pranks you have ever pulled?	Stapler in jello. Worked like a charm. He freaked out and called over to our boss, who thought it was hilarious.	A co-worker of mine decided he had enough of our warehouse manager parking his car in the loading dock area in the most inconvenient spot possible, so he took a roll of industrial-sized plastic wrap and completely wrapped the manager's car with the entire roll. Later that day, my co-worker clocked out to go home and discovered his bicycle (his main form of transportation) had been tied to a ceiling beam 40 feet in the air with no way to get it down. There was a note taped on the wall where he usually kept his bike during the day that said, "Get on my level."
Multilinguals of Reddit, what is your "they didn't know I could understand their language" story?	I'll flip the script. White male Chinese speaker here. I was at an internet bar in SE Asia a few years back. Everyone in the place was of non East-Asian ancestry, including the young blonde woman sat next to me. I called my GF and spoke to her in Mandarin over Skype. Nothing too raunchy, but some standard private romantic partner talk. After chatting with my GF and saying goodbye the blonde lady on my left turns to me and says "啊，你也会说中文吧。“ Turns out she grew up in Chongqing.	I'm a white guy who has been living in Singapore for the last two years. I speak fluent mandarin. I hear a lot of people talking about me but one of the cutest moments was as I was walking out of the train an older lady looked up at me in shock and said "wow handsome man" to her friend in mandarin I replied "wow pretty woman" as we walked by each other. It couldn't have lasted longer that a few seconds. The last thing I saw was her blushing and her friend laughing at her as the doors closed.
What was the dumbest thing you got punished for during school?	Dancing. I started playing "It's a small world" on my phone and began to give my friend a lap dance. My theology teacher walked up behind me while I was getting into it and gave me a detention for "harassment and bad music." Jokes on her, I still give lap dances to small world.	We had a rule during middle school that no one could talk in the hallways. If you got caught talking, you were given silent lunch, basically an apple, a salad and some milk, and you were to eat in silence. So many people got in trouble for saying "sorry" and "excuse me" and "bless you".
Who else checks reddit during their morning routine as if it were the morning newspaper?	Me. I rarely take it to the shitter, but I do check the front page to see if anything wild happened in the world.	Everyone. That's why if you want to make the front page your best bet is to post between 7 am and 11am EDT.
Parents of Reddit what's the weirdest thing you've seen while walking in or your children?	Since my parents do not reddit, I will tell my story. When I was 4-5, me and a friend were playing the floor is lava game. In the basement, the floor was covered in tiles that you could pull off the ground. We made pathways all around the house.	My 7-year-old sits, facing the wall (6 inches away), with her eyes crossed, holding the ends of her hair, talking to herself. My 4-year-old pooped in a jewelry box and put a 'blanket' on it.
[Serious] Redditors who used to be rich and now aren't: what happened and how are you coping?	Not to sound like a pretentious asshole, but I grew up with wealthy father, lived in big house in expensive country, father went crazy and left us with nothing. I'm still having some trouble coping.	Won a lawsuit in the late 90s and invested heavily in tech stocks. Big mistake. Decided that real estate was a safe investment and bought real property in the mid 2000s. Also a mistake. Spent most of the rest on education and came out OK as a tax attorney.
What word did you pronounce incorrectly for years?	GIF. I always say it "jiff" but apparently it's supposed to have a hard g. In this instance I choose to believe that I'm right and the world is wrong.	Not really a word, but a name in a song. The song "I'm Sorry Ms. Jackson" I thought was about a pumped up, black dude named "Cyramus Jackson". I thought he was literally pronouncing his name in the song. >I'm Cyramus Jackson, WOOOOO! I am fo' real!
What do you think the most ridiculous lyric line in any Top 40 song might be?	''Cause I'm looking at you through the glass... Don't know how much time has passed All I know is that it feels like forever' - Stone Sour Guy sounds like a damn stalker.	I throw my hands up in the air sometimes, saying "Heyyyy-oh, gotta let go" I just imagine some guy in line at the bank or something who has an uncontrollable urge to throw his hands up in the air and say that
Women, what happened when you took the initiative with a guy instead of just dropping hints?	Yep, he expected me to be his personal whore and 10 years later he still tries to booty call me. So lesson learned. Never again. Sorry nice guys. I really tried but I won't be doing that ever again.	We had gone out on a few dates, and there was clearly chemistry but he hadn't even tried to kiss me yet. After this evening of hanging out in a playground, we were sitting in his truck and he asked what I was thinking about. (Obviously, I was wondering when he was going to kiss me.) "I'll show you what I'm thinking about." I made the first move, and it was amazing. That was about 19 years ago...still together...still madly in love.
What is your best "Oh, that's what it does" moment?	When I learned how to use the 3 sea shells. I don't know why it took me so long. It's so simple.	My car has a button for the rear windshield wiper. Occasionally it would come on even if I hadn't pressed the button. I thought it was a short for the longest time, then I realized it only happened when I had the front wipers on and went in reverse. Car is smarter than I am.
What is your best 'How many people does it take to change a light bulb' joke?	How many feminists does it take to change a lightbulb? None. They just bitch and moan until a man does it for them, then complain about misogyny	How many Marxists does it take to screw in a lightbulb? None, the lightbulb contains the elements of its own revolution.
How do you ask someone you've known for a considerable amount of time his/her name because your forgot it without making the situation awkward?	I have a foolproof way to do this: ask them "hey what's your name again?". They'll tell you, albeit a little hurt that you forgot. After they've said, say "oh no, silly! I meant your LAST name!". Works every time for me.	Just use a friend. Take your friend over and say "Hey, I wanted to introduce you to my friend. This is John." The other person will say their name when shaking hands with John. If you have no friends named John, then this advice won't work for you.
What was your first kiss like?	Terrible. Not in the sense it was a bad kiss, it was actually pretty good, but who it was with is just...ew. She just got out the looney bin and was incredibly over weight and kinda ugly, oh also she was a known drug dealer.	It was nice. Me and my girlfriend were at a cliff embracing each other. When I decided to go in for the kiss, I missed her lips and hit her nose. I was too embarrassed afterwards to attempt it again. My girlfriend got impatient and decided to go in for it herself and we kissed. She liked it so much that I presume that I got my 100th kiss that day, too.
What is something that you were surprised about being able to do?	OPs mom. The line was *really* long. I was thinking: "this is what Republicans do to black people who try to vote".	Losing weight. I had been over 200lbs all through high school and had been around 250lbs since I graduated high school. I just hit 199 on the scale this week and while its small progress, it's only been 6 months and I've never loved my body this much. It doesn't take a fad diet. Move more, consume less. It works.
What stupid, day to day fact of life frustrates the hell out of you?	Religion. I just can't wrap my mind around how any educated adult can still say that they believe in it. I never let it affect my personal or work relationships - it's usually just something that exists in the back of my mind when I see it. I just don't get it.	Some people weren't raised with the same manners and the ability to think about someone else' possible situation like I was. I don't care if you're a ceo or a janitor I'm gonna shake your hand and say "hey my name is Nibblywibbly, how you doing today?" The same way. I can't stand people that disrespect the janitor because he's "just a janitor" or they leave their shit out because it's someone else' job to pick it up.
What's your "I shouldn't be here today" story?	I'm a test tube baby. Or petri-dish baby, if you prefer. Theists would probably argue that I shouldn't be here.	I was with a few friends at a fairly small local lake cliff diving (probably a good 30 foot cliff), jumped in, swam about a foot to the left and discovered a mass of rebar just below the surface.
[Serious] For those who have had someone die in their arms, what were your finally words to them and what were their last ones?	He said: "So, can I have that cigarette now?" And I said: "We'll get you that cigarette as soon as we get you out of here, buddy." Spoiler alert. He never made it out of there.	14 years ago I lost my wife to cancer. After 6 months of treatment she went from being mostly ok and going to work, to the next day going to a scheduled appointment and ending up in the hospital where she died 2 hours later. I took her to her oncology appointment and when things started looking very serious I signed her DNR paper and had her admitted to the hospital. A short time later, as we waited for some test results, I told her I loved her. She replied, "I know" and died as I held her.
I was just diagnosed with cancer and I'm out of Oreos. What's bothering you today?	You have my sympathies with the cancer but that headline is the worst, most desperate plea for attention ever to be created on reddit.	I need to take a shower but I don't have any clean towels *or* clothes, and not enough time to do the laundry. I also had a dream that I drank the best milk anyone has ever drank. I woke up knowing I'd never have milk that good. Kick cancer's ass, OP
Parents whose children never dated/found love/got married, how do you feel about it?	I'd feel like a failure both genetically and as a parent. My son is only 9, but we're not having any more kids. He's the only chance of my genes propagating. And more importantly, if he never has a romantic relationship, I totally failed to prepare my son socially. Having deep and challenging emotional relationships with other people is part of being human. If he chooses to avoid that, he's just hiding from life. And before anyone chimes in with various disorders that would legitimately prevent emotional connections to people. He doesn't have those. I'm not talking about all kids. Just mine.
