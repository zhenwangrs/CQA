What is the "If it doesn't scan then that means it's free, right?" of your profession?	I run a farmer's market. So mine would be customer: How much is this basket of tomatoes? farmer: $4 customer: Oh. Well how much is it if I come back at the end of the market and it's leftover? farmer: $6. (Actual overheard conversation from one of my very favorite farmers.)	I work for a cell phone carrier. The best way to get ZERO legitimate help from a sales rep is to start your conversation with "hi, I've been a customer for X years....." We don't care. It doesn't matter. Ever.	1
What was your "rebellious teenager phase"?	In middle school and early high school, I heard stories of all these kids my age sneaking out to go to parties and drink and stuff. I loved in the country and I didn't have many friends but I wanted to fit in so I'd sneak out at night to play with my dog, pet our horse, and stargaze.	I became an alt right Trump supporter who believed BLM was a terrorist organisation. I fI had stayed like that, I probs would've became an incel... Thank you Hbomberguy for showing me the way.	1
How many people are aware that men can get Breast Cancer too?	In Season 2 of Archer he gets breast cancer. And he starts a war with the Irish mob because they stole all of the chemo drugs, that episode is hilarious	I don't think this should be in askreddit. This is a variation of DAE or a yes or no answer. And it feels like a PSA. Also, the guy that used to say COME ON DOWWWWWWN on price is right died of breast cancer. So, there's that.	1
What's something that your parents didn't let you do because of a dumb reason?	My mom never sent me to camp because "I didn't want to go". Yes, because a child knows what's best for him. I also didn't want to do homework, but that didn't stop them from forcing it down my throat	When I was younger (10-14 ish) my dad wouldn't let me play online multiplayer games with others "Because people on the internet are assholes." Back then I thought it was bullshit, and now I know he was right. So very right.	0
Is there anyone out there who has ever tried to pick up or flirt with a celebrity? How did it go down, successful or not?	My Dad slept with Daryl Hannah back in the 90's. He was on a business trip flying cross country. Gets on the plane finds his seat. Daryl is sitting next to him. They make small talk. Plane takes off, Daryl falls asleep. Her head slowly slides over until its resting on my Dad's shoulder. Dad decides he'll never get another chance, quickly rests his head on her's and falls asleep. Dad henceforth claims he slept with her, which is true.	I didn't hit on her but I met The girl from Paramore. We were at a wedding of her college roommate whose parents were friends of mine. I think she was wearing a light pink bridesmaids dress. I also met Miley Cyrus' older sister. Nice girl. This was like five years ago or so. I'm in Tennessee and apparently was in Sunday school class with Miley as a kid and just don't remember it.	1
What's the most dirty, disturbing joke you've ever heard?	First you ask the question "What does a dead baby's cunt smell like?" Then you physically hold your fingers up under their nose. So, so wrong. *Edited for clarity.	What do spinach and anal sex have in common? If you were forced to have it as a kid, you'll hate it as an adult.	0
To all of the people who work the "late shift" at convenient stores (such as WaWa, 7/11, Quik E Mart), what is the craziest story that you have from your time working there past midnight?	A homeless guy who was friends with a tyranny hooker had the hooker press his Boobs against the glass of my glass cubicle. This was person looked like Flea with tits I shit you not.	Had a drunk guy come in fully clothed. Walked around for a minute. Stood in place for minute then head to the bathroom. When he came out he was wearing nothing but his t-shirt. Left the store hanging dong into 3 degree weather. Never saw him again.	0
You can send one message to yourself exactly 24 hours ago. What do you say?	New York State 2015-Feb-1 Pick 10 numbers for $500,000: 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 13, 17, 20, 21, 22, 28, 35, 45, 49, 59, 64, 66, 67, 70, 78.	You should find a way to watch the Super Bowl, I heard the halftime show was pretty okay. Also, that sake is going to mess you up, girl. Drink more water. Oh, and enjoy the sex!	1
Reddit, what was your first kiss like?	We were hanging out and I was lounged on the couch. She jumped on me and bit me on the neck (because she was crazy like that and I liked it anyway). I turned my head down towards her's as she came back up and it just happened. It was a strange relationship, best friends for 4 years before we actually got together properly. Then it ended cause she went crazy religious.	Mine was depressing. I was in 7th grade and she was in 8th. We made out for a few seconds then it was done. The kiss itself was meh, but later I would find out that she had to kiss me because she lost a bet and the kids she lost to thought I was gay. So yeah it sucked that she didn't even like me or anything and everyone thought I was gay because I had a combover.	0
What's your best 'It's not what it looks like' moment?	Back in high school my friends and I were filming a movie for school. Naturally, we wanted to be badasses and were filming a deal between some shady criminal types in a sketchy area. Halfway through, I turn to see a phalanx of cop cars driving straight at us (seriously, they drove up in a mighty ducks flying V formation). They throw open their doors and draw their guns, some of which were rifles, and yell at us to turn around with our hands in the air. I just happen to be the only one with a BB hand gun tucked in my pants...	I was throwing rocks from the train tracks at a gaggle of black kids in their back yard and my mom walks by while I'm collecting the rocks and thinks I'm trying to derail the train.	1
Reddit, what will be the hardest TV show to say goodbye to?	It's Glee for me. I like the songs they sang so far. Don't really care whether they are butchering the songs or not. The series made me accept two things about my life : that I'm gay and I had lost my faith in religion, and the series covered these two brilliantly. It will be quite hard for me to say goodbye to Kurt and Rachel.	Community, that show is the best I had a depressing couple of days after watching the end of the 3rd season.	0
[Serious] Have you ever witnessed a famous/infamous event happen first hand? What can you say about it that people might not know?	I was at the Boston Marathon in the middle of the happenings. There was a long time before first and second blast where I (and other people) were thinking t-shirt cannons. People were heroic and helpful after but I guess the mass panic of that many people FREAKED OUT is kind of not understood. There was blood on the ground, people ran, people pushed, I was holding my dog and just trying to get out and lots of very drunk people in that whole mess as well. I don't envy for the police who had to get that under control. There was a lot of vomit.	I was there when the seahawks threw away a second superbowl win on a dumbass play when they should have just handed it to the beast edit: cant tell if downvotes are from Pats fans or seahawks fans so salty they dont even want anyone bringing it up	1
One time while at a bar I asked a man how he defended himself when walking through a rough part of town. His defense was to act completely insane and yell random profanities while shaking his fist at the sky. Reddit, what are you interesting forms of self defense?	I walk down the street quoting bible passages while pointing a gun at everyone. No one wants to talk to the crazy religious person.	I was taught at an early age that if you're outnumbered and you feel like shit is about to go down, just act as crazy as you can, because most people don't like fighting crazy people. It's saved me from certain beat downs twice and got my nose reconfigured another time.	0
Gynaecologists - Does your work influence your perception of sexual intimacy? If so, how has it affected you?	I'm not a gynaecologist, but I still do gynecological exams quite frequently in my medical practice (general medicine). I don't think it's changed my perception of sexual intimacy at all. While it can be intimidating at first (when you learn it in med school), it quickly becomes "just another part" of the exam and as such, I don't perceive it to be sexual at all. The patient's perspective is often an uneasy feeling of vulnerability though, and I try my best to keep it as lighthearted and uneventful as possible. Same thing goes for breast examination, it's all about context. My brain knows these are "work" boobs and as such, it just doesn't do anything for me, whereas the same boobs shown to me in a non-work context would get my utmost and immediate attention.	I would have thought looking at the vagina in a clinical way is quite separate from the feel of your dick in one and your skin against her skin and the reactions she has to the pleasure.	1
Have you had a moment during a mundane activity where you stepped back and realized how beautiful the world is?	I was furiously masturbating this one time. Getting really into it. As I was about ready to "blast off" someone tapped me on the shoulder and said something about, "you can't do that on top of the Eiffel Tower" or something retarded like that. As I was escorted away, I noticed how nice Paris looked from that high up. *Edit - theres no signs up there stating you can't whack it. Just in case anyone was wondering.	Having a picnic with my girlfriend at Hiawatha Falls. I planned on proposing that day and was waiting for the right moment. It had been cloudy all day and after our little meal the sun finally came out. She asked me what my favourite moment of our relationship was, I told her it was then. With the sun peeking through the trees, I proposed. I noticed that no matter how beautiful I see the world as, it will never compare to her.	0
What's your favorite adult joke / adult reference in children's films?	“Racecars donf Need headlights, because the track is always lit” “Well so is my brother but he still needs headlights”	My favorite is from the movie Monster House DJ: (something along the lines of) Where are your parents? Chowder: my dad's at the pharmacy and my mom's at the movies with her personal trainer. I crack up every time.	0
What is the most disturbing/elaborate thing that you've ever seen someone do for attention?	Some girls in my former middle schools, and less (but still some) girls in my former high school would claim they had been raped when they had a pregnancy scare, were cheated on or dumped, were rejected, regretted a night of sex, or were caught by their parents. Most of the time, though, it was them trying to get back at their ex after the girl themselves broke up with them.	A college senior pretended to have a liver disease, requiring an imminent transplant, to keep the interest of one of my roommates. He only found out it was a ruse months after graduation when he met her father and asked about her. Always keep a suspicious eye on girls named Zoe.	0
Parents of Reddit, what is the most embarrassing thing your child has said while out in public?	Not a parent, but I know what story mine would tell about me. Once when I was about two it was me, my dad, and his dad out for a 'guys day out' for all of us to bond or something. All throughout the day my grandpa had been messing and teasing me, and apparently I had had enough, so in the middle of a shopping center I shouted at him "I'm going to rip off your head and shit down your neck." Needless to say dad whisked me away and we had no more male bonding days. Parents still have no idea where I picked that one up.	When my son was four he used to hook bungie cords to his bike and pull a wagon. He called them hookers instead of bungie cords. One day we are in the hardware store and he shouts out "Hey dad! Don't forget we need to pick up some hookers!" I'll never forget the looks on those peoples faces. It was both awesome and mortifying at the same time.	0
My dad used to be a writer for a newspaper in Boston and he had a humorous interview with Mitt Romney (about 15 years ago) that was never published. If I bugged him to write about it would anyone want to read about the interaction?	No. no one on this board full of liberals wants to read an "humorous" unread interview with the leading republican candidate for the upcoming election. No one at all. I really wish people would stop fucking asking if people would be interested in obviously interesting IAMAs.	Can we just ignore the GOP and pretend it doesn't exist? Remember when you did that in grade school, and after a while the annoying kid stopped being annoying? We could be free, and happy.	1
Which topic or field of study has the most "armchair experts"?	Military History. Everyone who had played CoD or watched a documentary on WW2 is an 'expert' and could tell you how Germany could have won or how France should have handled the blitzkrieg.	Gender. The number of times I hear a bigotted idiot say "It's just science!" while being completely wrong about the science of it is fucking mind-boggling.	1
What is something you do with the sole purpose of annoying people?	If a cyclist is on the pavement, I pretend I can't see them and walk into them, or try and make it so they wobble and fall off, or cycle into a wall. They can't see anything as they are on a footpath. I have got very good at this at bus stops, I can stand in just the right place and put my arm out for the bus, they are stuck then. Sometimes backfires if they are angry self righteous cyclists (which is common, but amusing nonetheless) or of they cycle into me...	My friends live in America (i live in Canada) and they always ask me "do you have x in Canada?" Or something just comes up, and I'll act super confused about it not knowing what it was, pretending not to understand it etc. The first time was they were talking about a breadbox, and I went on asking what was wrong with a cupboard and asking how breadboxes work and such. Now whenever I ask questions they ask "are you breadboxing me?" The answer is usually yes	0
How do I tell my roommate he smells bad?	Since you are both guys you can just tell him. "bro seriously, I know we mess around but you smell."	Give him a present, a body wash and deodorant to be exact, then ask him if he knows how to use them. If he says yes tell, him "then get to it buddy." if he says no tell him, "yeah considering your BO it's Pretty obvious."	1
Lifeguards of Reddit, what's the weirdest thing you've seen someone do in the water?	this guy was face down in the water motionless and we dove in after him making a big scene and when we got to him he just got up and looked at us like we were in the wrong. everyone on the beach deadass clapped when we got back lol	We once had a man come into our pool for lane swim. He had all the latest gear, brand new suit, cap and goggles. He got to the edge of the deck and did some arm circles, adjusted his goggles and dove into the pool. He popped up for a few seconds then promptly started flailing and gasping for breath. A colleague jumped in and pulled him out immediately. We were all really confused until he told us he had never swam before and he thought it came naturally.	0
I have an engagement ring to give away to a lucky couple. Tell me Reddit, why do you deserve this ring?	Well, it's a beautiful ring, and I think this is a very nice thing you're doing. I have no clue how you're going to pick the winner, because I've seen a few worthy stories - good luck with that. I'm very sorry your engagement didn't work out. I'd be interested in hearing your story, if you feel like writing it. (I'm not a contender, because I'm already married and already have a nice ring.)	i'm completely and whole-heartedly in love with my girlfriend. i'm at the point where i understand the lyrics in those sappy love songs. never thought i'd be there.	1
What excuse is almost always bullshittery?	"I think you got a virus on my computer playing your goddamn video games!" sure dad, doesn't have anything to do with you visiting truckerfuckers.com, huh dad?	"As a Christian".... as soon as a person start out this way my entire body shuts down... i reboot as a gigantic ashole...	1
Who's the toughest motherfucker you know?	My cousin would have to be the toughest guy I know. He told me one his stories where he was trying to enter a club of some sort and the bouncer was giving him problems. He told me the conversation went a little like this. Bouncer: Welcome to the Salty Spittoon. How tough are ya? Cousin: How tough am I? How tough am I?! I had a bowl of nails for breakfast this morning! Bouncer: Yeah, so? Cousin: Without any milk. Bouncer: Uh, right this way, sorry to keep you waiting. I felt nothing but respect and fear towards him after he told me about that incident.	My Grandpa, on Monday he fell, smashed his head on a rock, and broke a piece of his skull the size of a cork out of his head. He blacked out for a minute, then got up ,put his skull fragment in a sandwich bag,put a band aid on the hole in his head, and went about his business.	0
People of Reddit who have lived a double life: how did you get there and what happened?	Well, there was a support group for men with testicular cancer. The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob. Bob had bitch tits. Wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.	I have a name that's unpronounceable to most Americans. In elemntary school instead of listening to them mangle my name, I decided to choose a random English name to go by while in the States. Quite a lot of foreigners do this. A year came and went, and now I was in a new class with new teachers and new classmates. I decided on a whim to choose a different name to go by that year. I've been doing it every time I'm in a new social circle since then. I can tell when and where I met someone by what they call me.	0
People from small towns, what is The Event that is still talked about even years later?	From a town of 501 (literally) in rural Missouri. Around 14 years ago a HS student talked her boyfriend into knocking on her parent's door at midnight. The Father answers the door and the boyfriend shoots him 6/7 times. While this is happening the HS student goes to the parent's bedroom and shoots and kills her Mom in bed. Turns out she was going to burn down their house and collect insurance money on both of them and this was not the first time she had attempted to kill her mother. What threw a wrench in the scheme was the Father lived. He now teaches at the local HS, is remarried and still lives in the same house. The girl and the boyfriend are in prison for life.	Not in my town, but nearby shotgun shells were found in the highschool by a friend of mine's brother. No one talks about it really. On a more wholesome note, on our way to church we saw this squirrel that we had a good laugh about that had been ran over completely flat except it's tail which was sticking straight up. When we got to church, everyone was talking about it. you'd just be walking around, and it'd be in everyone's conversation even the pastor in the service mentioned it. This lasted two weeks, until it was flattened completely, then it was gone. If you bring it up people will know what you're talking about if they lived here at the time. Not as exciting, but the whole town loved him, and he was a celebrity for a while.	1
Reddit, what nonsexual activity would you be most upset about if you caught your SO doing it with another person?	My husband was a DJ when we were younger and one time I came into his bar and the female lead from the live band at the bar was wearing his hat. Strangely I felt annoyed and strangely she quickly took the hat off and returned it to my husband when she saw me.	Sharing a meal, like a sandwich. Go to cool activities I want to do, but he does it first with that person without asking. Like escaping room or going at the top of a building. Anything that could be meaningful in a romantic way ?	1
What's the videogame you've played the most and why?	Civilization 5. I'm not even a gamer but holy shit that thing is addictive. It starts off as "one more turn", which then develops into to "Oh I'll just capture this city quick" to "Well, it feels stupid to not destroy their capital now". 5 hours later and Alexander fucks me over in the World Congress and all that work is undone.	I know I'll get hate but I've spent close to 600 hours in Destiny which would be the most in recent memory. I guess Tetris would trump that if you add together all iterations that I've played	1
What’s a good job for introverts who only have a high school diploma?	I used to work at a cactus nursery and it was an introvert dream. Hell any plant nursery work is awesome and anyone can do it. You just pop in headphones and hang out with plants all day. It's super easy, and you get in awesome shape because you're on your feet all day lifting and moving plants.	Unpopular opinion, but I feel like any job in customer service would be good for an introvert. And not because they will enjoy it, but because it will help maintain their social skills. Since being introverted means you’re less likely to socialize with others, the communication skills you’ll learn will be helpful with being able to socialize better in the long run.	1
What is the fattest thing you've done?	I once had jelly beans and Red Bull for lunch. Another time I ate a king size Kit-Kat and washed it down with a white chocolate mocha. I almost puked that one up but I held it down.	Back in Middle School I would do anything for a laugh so I filled a 24oz Big Gulp with nacho cheese. I got about a quarter through it and realized that finishing my goblet of liquid gold might be the beginning of a downward spiral of poor life choices.	0
Just found out my EX broke up with me a week before our vacation so she could meet another guy there. She had been planning this for months. He has no idea we were together. Do I have the right to tell him he destroyed our relationship, crushed a 6 year old, and she has 2 STD's?	Fuck dude, you're a really nice guy. I would have started with and finished along the lines of "...actually, come to think of it, it would be a REALLY good idea to get checked for HIV as well." Then I'd hit the ground running with the physical portion of the program involving 4 of my friends to leave some physical scars too. All that being said...you are better off without scum like her. It's her fault but that dude knows better. You're sending a very clear message to both parties by going after Don Juan. Make it the last time that dude fucks with another guys gal.	How did HE destroy your relationship? You need to blame HER for destroying your relationship. He didn't know about you, so why hold anger for him? You should tell him about the STDs and that's all you should say. Well, perhaps throw in a "Good luck. She's your problem now."	0
Window washers of Reddit, what is the strangest thing you've seen on the other side of the glass?	I used to work as a window washer in Seattle. We would do a big office building about once a month. One window we passed was an active porn scene. Video camera and lighting and everything. The thing was, everyone was dressed as clowns, and the guy running the projector looked exactly like Joe Pesci. Not similar to Joe Pesci. *Exactly* like Joe Pesci. He started screaming at us to get the fuck away from their set, while waving a gun around. Then he shot one of the clowns in the face. We scurried a few floors away. I was right there with Joe. I don’t like clowns either.	The weirdest thing to me is a mansion with round the clock staff inside, they even wear uniforms. It's just this one rich dude his wife and their two kids. I'm not allowed inside, but I can see the wife. She's surrounded by the serving staff, but she never talks to any of them, and they don't talk to her. She seems really sad and lonely.	0
What are some double standards you hate?	Virginity - For a guy, being a virgin is generally a bad thing, it means you're a loser who can't score. As a girl, it usually means you're saving yourself for marriage. Extrapolated, a guy who sleeps around is celebrated, a girl who sleeps around is considered a slut or called "loose." And then marriage kind of flips it around. An un-married man doesn't have a lot of negative stereotypes to it, where-as unmarried women get pressured to settle down and have kids.	Woman is single by choice: Good for you! You're living your life, and you don't need a man! Man is single by choice: What's wrong with you? Do you not like women or something?	1
My grandma once chastised me for wearing underwear to bed because I need to "let my taco air out". What bizarre advice have you gotten from the older and wiser?	My Grandma (a model during the depression era) use to tell me, "Be proud when you walk! Throw those tits out!" When I would tell her I was only nine and I did not yet have tits, she would just say, "You guess where they are gonna be and throw that out!"	Storytime everyone. Do you know the story of the little red riding hood? I'm assuming yes. But most people don't know the meaning of the story, why was it told back in the days. In the Middle Ages, it was commun to live with every members of the large family within the family house, where people slept where they could. And people were used to sleep with members of the large family, like that cute little girl with the grandma. That fairy tale was a lesson to the younger : even if it's the grandma that is in bed, beware, for she truly might be the wolf. Got it? (edit some shit. English is not my first language)	1
I'm a Liberal Arts major, work at Best Buy and as a barista, and I own an iPhone and Macbook. I'm basically an embodiment of everything Reddit hates. Why would Reddit hate you?	* I'm over 30. * I'm a conservative Christian. * I'm voting for Romney. * I'm married to a woman. * I live in a house that I own. * I've never played Pokemon or Skyrim. * I love dogs and think cats are the spawn of Satan. and finally... * I like Nickelback. Edit: Wow, downvotes only two minutes after posting? I took it too far with Nickelback, right?	Are you kidding? You're basically *the* stereotypical Redditor. Even the part about thinking Reddit hates the things you do just makes you *more* of a stereotypical Redditor.	0
Why is /r/beatingwomen not being closed?	An extremely good question. Reddit is not a site that supports 'freedom of speech', rather 'freedom of speech, unless...' If you look at /r/jailbait, it says: "This subreddit has been shut down due to threatening the structural integrity of the greater reddit community." So how comes /r/beatingwomen is not threatening the structural integrity of the greater reddit community? Simply put, because the media haven't make a big deal about it. If you had women activist groups making a stand against the sub reddit and it was featured on the main news networks, then you might see it being taken down because: "This subreddit has been shut down due to threatening the structural integrity of the greater reddit community." TBH there might be a report function that I am unaware of, so you might be able to report it and get it taken down. Not sure.	Reddit is a platform for people to express themselves. Sometimes, people express themselves in ways that others aren't comfortable with. Aside from keeping the site within the law, and with some notable exceptions (namely r/jailbait), it maintains a hands-off approach to its content. It isn't an issue of freedom of speech in a legal, constitutional sense, but it is a site that aspires to be as open and free as possible, which is what its users expect and value. There is plenty of stuff on Reddit, and on the internet, that you should probably ignore.	1
So someone started a prank war with me at work. What are some of the best workplace pranks you have ever pulled?	Stapler in jello. Worked like a charm. He freaked out and called over to our boss, who thought it was hilarious.	A co-worker of mine decided he had enough of our warehouse manager parking his car in the loading dock area in the most inconvenient spot possible, so he took a roll of industrial-sized plastic wrap and completely wrapped the manager's car with the entire roll. Later that day, my co-worker clocked out to go home and discovered his bicycle (his main form of transportation) had been tied to a ceiling beam 40 feet in the air with no way to get it down. There was a note taped on the wall where he usually kept his bike during the day that said, "Get on my level."	0
When you were growing up, who was the first band that gave you that musical "magic" feeling?	I was a bit of a late bloomer. I didn't really find what turned me on until I was 17. Daft Punk's Alive 2007 changed everything I thought I knew about music. I really can't even stand listening to rock bands any longer, and I no longer feel like a freak when I tell people Led Zeppelin is one of the worst bands I've ever heard. They're like the Nickleback of the 70s.	my elementary music teacher was/is a hard core rock dude and so is my dad. when I first hear Tom saywer by Rush or when I first heard Brass Monkey by Beastie Boys or both was when I felt that "magical" music feeling	0
Girls, What was your worst sexual experience?	I was having sex with a new boyfriend for the first time. I had a seizure. He didn't realize what was happening at first and finished. To be fair, I hadn't had a seizure in years and he didn't know I had epilepsy.	If this thread was honest; ITT: Rape. Edit: this is odd. I can understand that people are unhappy that sexual assault is still so common in our society. However, I'm just the messenger. I'm not the one who's out there sexually assaulting women. Why the downvotes?	1
Former employees of fast food restaurants, what are some dirty secrets your chain or single restaurant didn't want your customers to know?	McDonalds for 5 years. When you're trained they encourage you to look for "golden moments", which are essentially targetting children and making them feel special.	Worked at Panera. First day a bagel flew through the slicer and hit the ground. No one saw so I served that ho. Also the paninis or however you spell that shit are made hella early. So anytime after like 3 your gettin an old ass panini that's been sittig in a hot box waiting to be served. And finally everyone at Panera steals money. Like three of my general managers were fired for stealing thousands of dollars and countless managers were caught fucking in the office or stealing shit. Place is a fuckig pig hole	1
Tech savvy people of reddit what are some cringe-worthy things non tech savvy people do?	Buy apple products Ripping USB sticks out of the socket. Without ejecting/killing the process for them first: you can actually corrupt a USB stick this way and I've seen it happen several times.	My mom used to have a habit of googling "free games" and downloading whatever came up. Needless to say, her computer was riddled with viruses.	0
Parents of reddit: What is the worst way your kids have ever embarrassed you?	My parents told me when i was in pre-school and or daycare* i was the kid who taught all the others how to take off there diapers and the safety protectors on electrical outlets...... thinking back that teacher must have hated me.	At a bakery near my house my sister asked my mom; "That man has big bum, how does he fit on the toilet?" He heard and so did everyone else in the store. My mom found a new bakery.	0
What's your sixth sense?	I have this awesome ability to leave my work desk at the right time and miss a call or two. I could be at my desk for hours and never get a call, leave for a few minutes and come back to a voicemail.	I’m psychic and even work with ex CIA Stargate people. I predicted COVID, a terrorism event and even found a missing child before. So I guess you can say, telepathy, remote viewing and precognition to name a few of the Noetic Abilities I have	1
What incredibly popular series/film could you never get in to?	Harry Potter. Got halfway through the first book and the first film. Could never finish either one. I just don't get it at all. EDIT: Downvoting, really? I thought that's what this thread is for.	I've never seen the appeal of the walking dead so I never cared to watch it. It seems everyone loves that show though.	0
What is your favorite TV show that is not worshipped on Reddit?	Rome. I wish they had a few more seasons to finish the story properly but it is still in my top five shows. Also Boardwalk Empire. Michael K. Williams and Stephen Graham as Al Capone absolutely kill it in theirs roles. Graham in particular was the best character on the show IMO.	Inside Amy Schumer. I'm not crazy about her stand-up, and her movies are weak. But her sketch show is solid. Very few misses.	1
Walked in on my little sister cutting herself, she confides her friends father has been sexually abusing her. What do I do?	You beat the hell out of him! At least that's what I would want to do after reading this post.. *I was drunk when I said that, nevermind me..	I don't know if it would be helpful to know, but my brother broke my trust in this kind of situation, and it was the right thing to do. He is my best friend to this day. Please stop what this man is doing.	0
What innocent question that someone asked you, crushed you a little?	“Table for how many?” the first time we went out for dinner after my Dad completed suicide. That one hit like a truck.	so unlike my sister , i don’t like wearing my skirt all the way down to my knees. i’ll wear it mid thigh and we’re out in public and she goes “why do you wear your skirt so short? do you like other people seeing your butt?” and i kinda crushed because i felt like a whore even though my sisters only 10	1
At 27, I've realized recently that I cut people off in conversations and rarely reciprocate polite questions in small talk. Reddit, what's your major "Holy shit, I'm an asshole!" moment?	You are not an asshole, you are either a New Yorker or some other type of person who has a life and is busy.	If I go to a party, and there is shrimp cocktail, I will stand over it and eat it all until its gone, like a vacuum cleaner.	0
Now that you're an adult, what is the best story a family member has told you that they couldn't when you were younger?	Not my family, but...In high school there was this typical irritating, overly bubbly, cheerleader in my class. Not a terrible person, just a snot, but she never shut up. And she was loud! Sometime after our first reunion word got out that she actually was originally a twin, but cannibalized/absorbed the other one in the womb. The running joke was she talked her twins ear off and then couldn't stop.	My father used to own a strip club when I was about five years old. All of the nice ladies who babysat for me, brought me the best birthday gifts, took me out for ice cream? Strippers.	0
What was there a black market for at your school that wasn't drugs/alcohol?	Demerit cards. Every student got one at the start of the year. Get in trouble, get a mark. Three marks was detention (JUG.) Too many detentions was a suspension and so on. A couple of bright students came up with the idea to sell fake demerit cards so that if you were close to filling one up, you could just give the teacher the other one. The school caught on pretty quick.	My High school had a small prostitution ring going on. Girls would "hang out" outside the 3rd floor boys washroom. There would be a guy inside the bathroom at all times. You'd just nod at the girl of your choosing and hand the guy inside a $20.	1
What is your creepy unexplained childhood experience?	Laying in bed one night, it's pitch black apart from the light creeping under the door from the landing. My mum was actually with me in the same room as we had only just moved in and she was sleeping on the floor. I look up and the door slowly creeks open and slowly an oldish women peers around the door looks at me and goes away. I just thought I was in a nightmare and turned around real fast and went under the covers, hoping I would wake up. Then I will never forget my mum whispering to me "Did you just see someone peer round the door?". Safe to say we didn't sleep a wink that night.	One time me and my cousin were gonna go to the park and my sister and mom stayed home and when I got back my sister told me why I didn't go to the park and I was like what are u talking about I did go and she was like I saw you walk to the door frame of the kitchen and you had a coke bottle with you and you took a sip and then you left, and I told her that didn't happened and I did go to the park it was so fucking weird I started freaking out and I knew she wasn't lying because she looked so scared and she was on the verge of tears. We were both fucking scared for the rest of the summer	1
Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines of Reddit, what is one thing about the military that civilians just can't understand?	Someone who joins the military isn't automatically a "hero" or a "good person". The same assholes you knew in high school joined the military. The same cliques, the same backstabbing. All of it is in the military. Also, 90% of the Air Force does not fly. I'd safely say 70% never sees combat, and that might be low balling it.	It's all about us, the team. I may hate everyone I wirk with, but I would die for any of them. Not for civilians, fuck you.	1
What made you cool in school that would be very uncool in adulthood?	In 3rd grade I broke my arm and got a glow in the dark cast, I also had glow in the dark shoes, I think it was the most my peers have ever liked me in my life.	I've hurt a lot of my classmates through bullying because they were gay, black, or fat. Yes, it made me look cool and intimidating at the time but doing that now would make me look like a selfish asshole.	1
What's the strangest thing you've ever been paid for?	I had a friend and his girlfriend stay over at my house while my parents were away when we were all in high school. The only rule was that they couldn't have sex. My friends girlfriend paid me 20$ to let them have sex in my parents bed.	I was given a free t-shirt in a nightclub that said "I LOVE TOM'S MUM" and a guy offered me £20 for it so he could wear it and piss off his mate called Tom. So naturally, I said yes	0
What is your Tinder horror story?	I'll skip all the superfluous details: I went over to a matches house and beat his ass at Mario Kart. His roommate that was 350 lbs and reeked interrupted our 'date' and demanded a game. When I beat him he is in shock. Says that most girls aren't good at gaming. Match gets a call from Mommy so I go to his room while he takes it in the hall. Fat roommate follows me inside the room and plops down next to me. Proceeds to try and hit on me, slut shames me for using tinder, and then whips out his cock to see if I might 'suck him off' when I'm done with his friend. Ran the fuck outta there.	Buddy of mine hit it off with this girl and after a few days, she invited him over to a house party. "Sure" he says, what could go wrong? He shows up and is introduced to a few of her friends, all guys. As the night carries on, more and more guys show up and very few girls are actually at the party. After they start talking about how they all know this girl they find out that she invited them all from Tinder. Every guy was there not to hook up, but to populate this chick's birthday party. EDIT: Auto corrects from phone	1
What was the most irrational fear you had as a child?	I'm afraid to watch the popular TV show 'Friends' because when I was 4 years old I came downstairs and saw the episode where one of the characters had a turkey or a chicken on their head except at the time I had no fucking clue what it was it scared the life out of me and resulted in a panic attack. To this day I have never watched an episode of that satanic show and I never will.	Pool sharks. Invisible sharks in the deep end of the pool. I'm still afraid of open water where I can't see the bottom.	0
What amusing or bizarre theories did you have as a kid?	When I was a kid I thought cats and dogs were the same animal, but cats were female and dogs were male.	Those white marks you get on your nails when you hit it with something? Cancer. WTH was wrong with me? I told tons of kids about that. I feel shame.	1
What is a great “poor person” hobby?	Drawing. Even if you think you're not good at it, do it for 10 minutes for 10 days in a row. That tenth drawing will show your progress. Once you recognize you can grow a talent like that fairly quickly, it's much easier to start. Then, you can start creating things you're really proud of, and it'll help you stop feeling so poor. Source: am broke as a joke	Tieing a rope around two trees and trying to walk on it. But make sure to do it in an area with a LOT of traffic, because if you no can see you do it than what's the point?	1
What did you do as a kid that formed bad habits as an adult?	i'm not an adult yet (16) but the struggle makes me feel like one never talk about my feelings or express myself.	Internalizing all my problems. Now I struggle to go to anyone with anything. I’m so used to just keeping everything bottled up.	0
Airplane pilots of Reddit, what was your biggest "We're all fucked up" moment that you survived and your passengers didn't notice?	Not a pilot but a flight attendant. We landed, everything went smoothly, as we’re deplaning the pilot steps out of the flight deck and goes “wow, I’m glad we made it, we lost 2 hydraulics on the way down”.	Was flying a 737max when the nose dove down super quick. I tried to pull up when it finally corrected itself. Hope they get that issue sorted out	1
Redditors with great parents, What did they do RIGHT?	The smartest thing my parents did for me was breaking up while I was incredibly young. Looking at them as a grown adult you see how horribly wrong they were for eachother, and how much of a disaster zone it would've been growing up in a family that was staying together just to raise me. Instead, they have both lived happy, turbulent lives, and showed me exactly what not to do in relationships. Both have been married 3 times and are fiercely independent people with their own ideas. They could've stuck together for my sake but went their separate amicable ways - As a result, they gave both themselves and me a happier, more independent lifestyle, so I thank them for that.	They didn't force a religion or political ideology on me. In fact there were never any discussions of God or politics in my home. I am so grateful that I wasn't pushed into a religion. I'm an atheist, I'm a scientist, and I have a strong moral compass.	1
I live in Asia, but my school is in Europe. I commute everyday between the two continents. It is very regular for the people living here. What is something relatively unique about the place you live in?	I live in Rome, Italy, and see a 2000 year old pyramid from my bathroom. Also, I often drive around the Colosseum at 70 km/h just to get somewhere because I'm late.	One of the most beautiful cities in the world, Istanbul. Nothing better than a ferry ride at sunset drinking apple tea.	1
Reddit, we've all seen the dirty joke threads. But what is your best intellectual joke?	There are only 10 types of people in the world: Those who can read binary numeration and those who cannot.	Linguistics joke. Professor says, "So, as we can see, in some languages a double negative is a positive, and in other languages a double negative is still a negative, but in no language is a double positive a negative." A voice from the back of the classroom says, "Yeah, right."	0
Why don't Americans talk more about the cause of the Vietnam war being a lie?	At this point, most people in the US know and agree that it was just a proxy war with the USSR and China intended to stop the spread of communism. The actual excuse used for going in is irrelevant. EDIT: I should clarify. I don't mean that the causus belli is irrelevant to history, but rather that most people no longer care about the specifics of how the US justified entering a war nearly 50 years ago. I'm not saying we *shouldn't* care, just that most people (as far as I can tell) *don't* care; they know that the war happened and have a vague idea of what it was all about, but aren't interested in the specifics. I know that there are many Redditors who are well-educated in this period in history (and many who lived through it), so I'm sure many of you will disagree with me.	Correction: The American public at large does not speak about these things. Intellectual, inquisitive-minded people do. That's a small subset of the American population, and I'm American. Americans are some of the most poorly-educated, vapid people alive. We're self-centered, ethnocentric, bigoted, stupidly patriotic over nothing, and have the most ignorant, limited worldview I've ever had the displeasure of living in the midst of. Americans are more concerned with farting, fat little white trash pageant babies than what's going on in the world. Does that answer your question???	1
What is something you should learn as soon as possible?	That it does not matter if you arent one of the cool kids. Its all about getting together with some good like-minded people.	No matter how much you practice something and no matter how good you think you are at it, there will always be a prepubescent Asian kid who can do it better. So don't even get your hopes up.	1
What has your town/city been in the news for lately?	Baby was thrown in the dumpster and found alive and ok by hobos canning a few weeks back. Made national news	Rob Ford smokes crack, Rob Ford tells journalist he has more than enough [pussy] to eat at home, Rob Ford gets cancer......Welcome to Toronto	0
Reddit, what's the weirdest thing that has happened to you in a foreign country?	I had to go to Finland for a work thing last year. I saw two hobos beat up some young black kid at the train station. After the police arrived they walked behind a corner with the hobos, talked for a while and then one of the hobos gave one of the cops a blow job and everyone just left. The black kid never got any medical help and pretty much crawled out.	One time while visiting Ecuador I had a water balloon thrown at me from across the street which slapped me right in the back of the head. When I turned to face my assailant I saw two little old ladies on a rooftop holding water balloons, looking down in my direction, and laughing at me. Ecuador's an interesting place.	0
Martial artists of Reddit, have you ever been in a situation where you had to use your skills/techniques to defend yourself? How did it play out?	An underrated skill learned in all forms of martial arts is how to properly brace yourself and fall. It especially comes in handy when you're drunk.	Like somethin out of a Fuckin Three Ninjas movie, this guy took a huge swing at me, and I dodged, he nailed his buddy, who I didn't know was going in to grab me, right in the eye. Home boy held on, and the first guy starts throwing sloppy combos, all of which I dodged while being held, and about 99% of which connected with the dickhead who was butthugging me until his lights went out. It was crazy.	1
What are some odd sensations you experience that your not sure if anyone else experiences?	The mental sensation that there are two kinda orbs or things rotating around me at all times that I can somewhat control the movement of with my mind. But it's difficult to, and when they collide and get mixed up it's uncomfortable and annoying, I have to get my mind off it and think about something else.	Besides the occasional sleep paralysis, some times I will become EXTREMELY aware of my being. Feels a little like minor panic. Usually only lasts for a second or two but it's eerie.	0
How did your school bully turn out?	Not sure, but i got revenge. I grew some illegal plants in pots. I moved them to his property and tipped off the police. I don't like bullies.	Bully #1 now plays in the local soccer team and tells me hi whenever he sees me. Bully #2 is dead.	0
[Serious] Paramedics, what are the mistakes people do while waiting for your arrival?	Would love to know how many actual paramedics are on this thread as opposed to people who've had basic first aid training etc. You aren't helping... I'd go with giving anything orally to patients having seizures which has been written a few times. And also as a separate issue, not taking pain relief for a pain you've had for a few days that is blatantly not life-threatening prior to calling an EMERGENCY AMBULANCE. Seriously people...	If you call 911 and have someone available to stand at the road that helps out. Also if you didn't call 911 and you see an ambulance driving down your street with the lights on don't wave.	0
If a rich man like Bill Gates decided to finance a mission to Mars, could he do it without approval from governments?	There is no such thing as "governments." It's only individuals sitting in offices, wearing uniforms, making speeches, etc. If someone wants to do something and they can accomplish it without infringing on the rights of another, then they need *no one's* permission. Laws be damned.	I've always hoped for a space race to Mars in a somewhat similar fashion to the race to the Moon (minus the whole Cold War thing). Technology took leaps and bounds during that time and hordes of kids were aspiring to be astronauts. It would be a nice change from kids aspiring to be on the Jersey Shore. edit* Added the letter "s"	0
What was the biggest controversy on reddit?	Reddit detectives pinning the wrong guy as the Boston bomber. The guy they blamed has long been dead before the bombing. They doxxed and harrased the guy's family, who at the time was still grieving for their son.	Tecent controversy that actually has any ground to stand on? Probably the recent turn towards a biased pro censorship style of moderation from the admins.	1
What are some of your secret personal superstitions?	I have all the classics like walking under ladders, black cats, spilling salt etc. But some of the odd ones for me are tapping the dashboard when i go through a yellow light, counting the letters of words or sentences and adding words in my mind to make the count divisible by 5, I dont use yellow lighters...theres more but im blanking on them, most of them i just do naturally, i dont really think about it...	Parade Theory- Basically, you are in an alley, about to take a piss. No one is around. You look left, you look right...no one. You get close to the dumpster, unzip your pants and let it flow... And a car comes down the alley, two people walk past, and a stray dog watches you piss.	0
[Serious] Ukrainians of reddit, how are you involved/affected by the riots?	This will never end, I quite find this rioting shit being extremely stupid. I lived in Ukraine for about 5 years from when I was born and my family moved out of there as fast as we could because in all honesty its a pretty bad place to live in, now with the riots its just worse and worse. My grandparents still live there in Kharkov but they haven't said much about the riot coming to our city, seems like its mostly happening in Kiev	A girl I know is Ukrainian and flew from Canada to be there. She is updating her facebook and it's pretty horrifying. Says she has been at the blood bank multiple times to donate, running back and forth to deliver bandages, water, bread. That they hear multiple gunshots and their "riot police" (berkut) are sniping people. She has posted pictures of molotov cocktails (dozens of them). 20 protesters went missing last night. One girl had her mouth sewn shut and another had fire crackers inserted into her anal cavity and lit on fire. Sounds pretty fucked up. Praying for her safety and everyone elses.	0
Twins of reddit, are you 100% sure your parents never mixed up who was who before you knew your own names?	Yes. I have an ear tag on my left ear while my twin does not. Lucky for my parents we came with a built in identification system.	I have identical twins and it's impossible to mix them up as there are lots of little differences. When they are newborn babies there is also a massive difference between them as for the first few days they both still have a bit of the umbilical cord attached and it's impossible to make those things look the same. By the time the umbilical cords fall off you'll have noticed the other differences like moles, slightly different face shapes, dimples and personalities. For dumb parents though just nail varnish the toenail of one twin and you're good.	1
What is something about computers that everyone should know how to do but doesn't know?	They're not made out of fucking enchanted wizard metal. Just read what's on the screen and react rationally. 95% of the problems I encounter at work could be solved if people paid attention.	As someone who knows very little about computers, it drives me insane when IT guys think everyone should know the basics. Maybe we should, but that applies to other facets of life as well. The IT guy at my work is a fat slob. Do I make him feel like a moron because he honestly doesnt think eating 100g of carbs after 8PM is a bad idea? No. In my experience, computer savvy people tend to be the most arrogant, elitest people in the world. Get over yourselves.	1
People that attended a wedding where someone "spoke up" or objected to the marriage, what did they say and did the wedding get called off or did it go on as planned?	Cousin got married last weekend. I objected by saying, 'Stop the wedding, stop the wedding! I need to go pee' they paused the wedding until i came back from the bathroom. The fucking awkward pause and the looks were hilarious.	Guy said that it would be a crime because two people who are “so fat and ugly” should never make love nor have children. He was the groom’s uncle’s plus one, an old buddy from college who was obviously drunk and probably on drugs. He was removed but it left a bad note on the whole thing, with about an hour of people consoling the bride	0
If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone? Why haven't you told them yet?	"I'll wait for you on the door, Mom. Don't hurry." I don't believe in the afterlife, but my mother is really religious. It would devastate her to lose me and know that I'm still a convinced atheist. I'll never say it as long as we're on good health, I'm as stubborn as her on this issue. But, if I were to die... Screw all that, I'll throw away all my beliefs to make my mom smile one last time.	My girlfriend has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (type IV); [that's just backstory, don't pity-karma me] I admire you for your strengths, care for you because of your weaknesses, and love you for you. You aren't dead yet.	1
What's your favorite quote from a fictional character?	"Sometimes, the only chices you have are bad ones... But you still have to choose" - Twelfth Doctor ( Doctor who.... WHERE ARE MA WHOVIAN BROTHAS AND SISTAS AT!!)	“It is a curious thing, the death of a loved one. We all know that our time in this world is limited, and that eventually all of us will end up underneath some sheet, never to wake up. And yet it is always a surprise when it happens to someone we know. It is like walking up the stairs to your bedroom in the dark, and thinking there is one more stair than there is. Your foot falls down, through the air, and there is a sickly moment of dark surprise as you try and readjust the way you thought of things.” A Series of Unfortunate Events: The Reptile Room by Lemony Snicket	0
You have $1000 to survive on for a year, without going bankrupt. If you succeed, you get $20,000,000. How do you do it?	As long as nothing goes too wrong with my rental properties I could do it. The tenants pay the mortgage on the one (the other is paid off ). My current living situation doesn't require any money from me. my fiancés house is paid off and the only real bills are phone/tv/Internet and power and he pays them. Don't freak out. I buy the groceries. Pay for trips. And I'm his maid, cook and back scratcher and I love it.	Tell my parents I get 20 mill if I live off 1k for a year. Then they will let me live rent free for the year as they know I'd give them a large chunk of the winnings.	0
Does anyone have any funny stories of when their parents gave them "the talk"?	Something along the lines of "Don't do it until marriage because God will be angry" and "It'll make you a slut" blahhhblahhblahhh.	Before I got the talk, I found a sex-ed book laying around. My mom "caught" me when I was on a page about condoms which included an illustration of one that was half-unfurled. She asked if I knew what it was. To 8-or-9-year old me it looked like a sombrero, so I replied (completely deadpan) "It's a Mexican hat." I don't remember her reaction, but I'm guessing it was a pretty massive facepalm.	0
Yesterday, a woman asked me if her phone case could send txt messages without the need to buy a phone...What is the dumbest/most clueless customer you have ever dealt with?	I work at a school as a janitor..sometimes I'll just walk into a classroom and see an equation on a blackboard and just finish it.	I work in customer service for a cell phone company so everyday I hear the dumbest customer I've ever heard. But a good one was when a customer called complaining about international numbers calling an soliciting her. I asked what the number was and she gave me a standard 10 digit number. I asked why she thought it was international to which she said "because the caller ID says it's coming from the District of Columbia". -	0
What’s the weirdest thing to happen to you in a public bathroom?	Pissing next to a guy during a play in my local theatre. Guy glances at little Ronnylicious and excitedly nods his head whilst revealing a big grim. He says I should be proud. I start to blush. He says it is okay for me to look as well, so I peek. He has a beautiful black King Dong and I ask him "*Is it okay if we switch hands while we finish?*" he says it is fine. I feel the urine pulsing through his Johnson. Was the greatest euphoria I've ever felt ^^^SecondPartDidNotReallyHappenBtw	Was at college needed to a quick break went to the bathroom for a leak. As I finished pissing I heard someone in one of the stalls whispering help repeatedly, asked if he was all right and he said he needed help with something. Was naturally a little sketched out and almost walked out but I went over anyways. I had to crawl under the stall. He ended up being a paraplegic who had fallen while trying to get into his chair, dick hanging out and all. I had to lift him from the floor to his wheelchair. It was a little awkward but I’m glad I helped him out god knows how long he would have laid there. He said thank you and I never saw him again.	0
What is the stupidest thing that has come out of your mouth that you're willing to admit to?	In January of 2001, I said to a friend, "He won't be that bad. It's not like he's going to destroy the economy and start world war three."	"Dude, I don't fuckin' care." Said to my boss while he was explaining for the seventh time *why* something needed to be done that I was already working on. What I was trying to get across was "it doesn't matter why, I'm going to do it anyway and I could be working on it instead of talking to you right now." Yeah, it didn't come across that way.	0
Family &amp; friends of porn stars, what was your initial reaction after finding out your friend or relative got into pornography?	Gonna drop a knowledge bomb, always go after the fat girls. They'll always give 100% because they don't know when they're gonna get it again.	A male friend of mine played a part in a porno once. It was pretty bad and he did it for kicks and the money. It was just him and a chick, chick wasn't verry pretty and everything about it was really bad. Wouldn't watch it again. Was impressed with the size of his penis though! Edit: Damn this post went up quicker than his dick did in the porno. To answer most of your questions: Yes, I complimented him in real life.	0
What's the most annoying commonly used sound effect in movies?	Every time any actor touches or even approaches a microphone to speak, there is a rip of high frequency feedback.	When a group of guys are pointing rifles at someone but decide to reload or cock their gun once the target is knocked down so you have like 90 reload click sounds (last seen in Logan)	1
What's the most fucked up thing a guest did in your house?	Was sharing the perfect party apartment: lots of space, good location, nice enough to invite people over, not so nice you're afraid to have guests, and a landlord who allowed residents to have roof access. So I threw a party New Year's Eve and 60 people show up. The problem wasn't a dirty bathroom afterward--problem was a suspiciously clean one. The top of the toilet was absolutely spotless the next morning. Turns out one of my friends' dates had been using that to snort lines of cocaine. Aaah, yeah. Felony right there. And I'm the hostess. Which could have been all kinds of trouble if a neighbor had made a noise complaint.	Happened to a friend. When we were younger this kid came over to his house and took a shit and didn't flush or use toilet paper. Then, a few weeks later when my friend went over to his house he was going to return the favor, but lo and behold there was already a turd waiting for him.	0
HR workers of Reddit - what's the worst way you've seen an employee screwed over by the company?	There was a layoff and I was told I am safe, as I was an apprentice. They were letting the other apprentice go. The other apprentice is a triple threat 3 pointer, and they cried and cried (not real cry but bitching) and at the last minute the company big boss, co owner or something, came to the job and told the foreman and superintendent I was to get laid off and they were ganna keep the other apprentice because I was not worth any points being a white male who was not a city resident. Affirmative action is bullshit	I worked for an oil company, and lived through mass redundancies when the oil went belly up. They sent out a list of which positions were being made redundant, with numbers for how many people currently held that role and how many they were cutting it to. So if it said 'Buyers | Current: 4 | Consultation: 3' you knew that if you were a buyer you'd be under scrutiny and 25% of your team would be gone soon. I sat at my desk and opened the e-mail. Looked for my position, no redundancy for me. The girl next to me opened hers and saw 'Her position | Current: 1 | Consultation: 0'. That's how she learned she'd lost her job.	0
Today my employer held a catered "leadership conference" for managers only, aiming to improve employee moral. The employees were left out, hungry and had to work twice as hard to make up for absent managers. Reddit, what idiotic things has your job done for the benefit of the employees?	They created a facebook page and sent out an email with the link to everyone's work accounts advertising it and asking everyone to like them on facebook. Facebook is blocked at my work. &#3232;\_&#3232;	Guys, it's driving me nuts... Moral Adjective: Concerned with the principles of right and wrong behavior and the goodness or badness of human character. Noun: A lesson, esp. one concerning what is right or prudent, that can be derived from a story, a piece of information, or an experience. **Morale** Noun: The confidence, enthusiasm, and discipline of a person or group at a particular time.	1
What is the most disgusting or disturbing thing you have found out about a roommate or family member, but kept to yourself as to not embarrass them?	My dad likes being fucked in the ass with a twelve inch hard plastic dildo. He is also secretly a cross dresser and describes himself to his online friends as a lesbian trapped in a man's body. I found pictures.	Someone older in the family has a taste for teen porn. Edit: Not sure why I was downvoted. Anyway, I found this out when using the family computer and 20-30 videos were saved in a folder. I accidentally found the folder when searching the entire drive for some old videos I had on there.	1
Reddit: what are some insults/comebacks you have planned out in your head to say, and are waiting for the right moment to say them?	As a smoker, people say my breath stinks like shit. I´am waiting for a girl to say this to me so I can yell WELL YOUR MOUTH SMELLS LIKE DICK, YOU WHORE CUNT.	I recently delivered a "I would agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong" to someone during a disagreement. It felt good.	0
Flight Attendants/Pilots of Reddit, what is the craziest thing that has happened mid flight, where the passengers have been blissfully unware?	This started off with us blissfully unaware...ended with mild pant shitting. I was flying to France in one of those planes with the TV screen up front to show the flightpath and where you currently are. I was just about to fall asleep when the captain asked over the PA if there was a doctor on board and if they could go to seat #. I knew this was bad. The flight path changed to Canada and we had to make an emergency landing. We were stuck there for 2 hours. When we finally got to France his entire row was quarantined off. I have no idea what the fuck happened...	I'm just a passenger. The last time I flew I had my five-month-old daughter on my lap, which made the horrible turbulence even more horrifying. I thought we were going to die and I felt so sad and guilty for choosing to fly. (She slept the whole time even though I was squeezing her pretty tight.) I was trying to look to experienced travelers and flight attendants for assurance that it was nothing to worry about, but they all seemed pretty nervous too. I'm glad the flight crew lets people stay blissfully unaware for the most part...I'd rather be lied to than terrified.	1
What's something unforgetable a teacher has said to you or your class?	I was bullied alot in junior high. One day in class I had enough of this one kid who had been throwing paper at me for most of the day. So I turned around and said "If you don't quit that I'l showe this paper down your throat". The little bastard then tried to rat me out my calling to the teacher "teacher, teacher. BananaShotgun is threatening me!". The teacher turned around and shouted "Shut your mouth or I will shove it down your throat myself!" Kid never bullied me again.	"You're not here to learn chemistry, you're hear to learn how to learn." I didn't, though. **TAKE THAT, MR. WALKER!** That jerk didn't invite me to his wedding...	1
What is your unusual life hack?	When drying yourself off after a shower, use half of the towel to dry the top half of your body, and the the other half of the towel (the side with the tag) to dry your ass and legs. This way, you never end up drying your face with ass-towel.	Make a list. Feel overwhelmed? Make a list. Focus on only one thing on your list at a time. Can't seem to be productive? Make a list. Make the first thing on your list "make a list". Cross it off when you're done. Look at you being productive! Feeling directionless? Make a list. Write down what you'd like to accomplish today, this week, this month, whatever. Focus on just one thing at a time, and genuinely allow yourself to feel good about crossing off an item from your list, no matter how small. Make a list!	0
Hey Reddit, what's your favourite podcast?	The Adventure Zone. Three brothers and their dad playing DnD. Starts hilarious and light. But by the end you'll be as emotionally invested in it as Game of Thrones.	TRIFORCE. It's 3 guys talking about life while being absolutely hilarious. I can't listen to it on public transport because of how much they make me laugh.	0
What don't you want your landlord to know?	I did major electrical work to fix a bunch of junction boxes because they weren't to code and bothered me. I blamed the entire building being out of power for ~1 hour on a GFI outlet in my apartment. He didn't know any better and believed me.	I keep a pet hedgehog in my room. Her whole enclosure is really small, so it's not that difficult a secret. If the landlord didn't live next door, I'd probably have a cat too.	1
Private Investigators, what is your best story?	There was a drug dealer in california who's ex wife belived he took something of hers. I found where he hung out thanks to his unusally high amount of porno mag subscriptions one of which he tossed in the garbage thus leading to his address. I walked into the joint I've been casing for almost two weeks dressed as a health inspector since the front was a bar and made my way around back. There I opened a door and saw the thing I've been looking for, not just for this case but my entire time as a Private investigator. Before me where 95 rock hard erected penises and a sign saying "use the serious tag next time".	I did a little investigating on the side way back in the day. Through some surveillance I was able to catch my 8 year old neighbor in the act of using a shovel to fling his dogs poop over the fence into our yard. Thus solving the mystery of why I swore I was picking up our dogs poop and then there was still poop in the yard afterward. He had pick up my dogs poop for a month after that. I had to retire from PI duty shortly after that because middle school took up too much of my time. Also not enough cases could be solved by Encyclopedia Brown style logic puzzles.	0
Teachers of Reddit, what was the most creative example of cheating that you have witnessed in your class?	ITT: Methods of cheating that would have all failed instantly in my school, even the really clever sounding ones and the ones that only girls can do.	A kid in my Calc class worked at a T-shirt print shop and designed a shirt that had a bunch of random words and shit all over it. It was just a white shirt with black words and numbers kind of aimlessly placed all over the shirt. At first glance, it just looks like a regular t-shirt. He snuck in a bunch of formulas upside down on the front of the shirt that unless you closely examined the shirt, you'd never know. He knew exactly where they were, and when he needed to recall one, he'd just glance around and find the one he's looking for.	0
People who like to spoil things for others, why are you like this?	My friend does this unintentionally all the time. He doesnt mean it, he is just super hyped about some bit of a movie and desperately wants to tell you about it so everyone can bask in the glory of how awesome that bit is, sometimes he actually ends up making the bit he tells you about better, but most of the time he just gives something important away while thinking he is being obscure enough, which he isnt (but I know he really tries, the darling). Or maybe Im just really really good at working stuff out with minute amounts of info. Id love to believe that my brain is some super awesome detective machine, but nah. &#x200B; tl:rd : My friend gets over exited and wants to share the love, its not malicious at all.	While I try to avoid it out of respect, I would like to make people face it more often. The plot is only one part of media and it gets too much focus these days. There is also the visuals, audio, action choreography, and much much more. Also people who really care about spoilers should take more care to experience the media within a reasonable time. I think within a month of knowing the story exists should be enough time. I would encourage people to spoil the plot of a big movie before seeing it and judge if it really impacts the viewing experience.	1
What's the most embarrassing/creepy thing you know about a friend that they have no idea you know about?	I was going through my friend's pictures on her phone (and at that point, we were in 5th grade so this was an innocent adventure), and yes, a picture of her vagina comes up. But this was no ordinary snatch shot. Her mangled curly red bush was 3D, and you could see the twinkle of the random golden pubs throughout her mane. It probably stood around two inches tall. I had no pubic hair at this point, and I was terrified that something that horrific would happen to me. Fear turned into anger quickly, because i realized the bed spread underneath her peach, was mine. Its been ten years since this happened, and we are still friends. I get more enjoyment telling my other friends, because the best part of the story is that I never told her about it!	Not so much a friend, but I was once nosing through an acquaintance's camera and found lots of pictures of sleeping women. I was relieved not to be amongst them. He was passed out drunk at the time and never knew we knew.	0
[Serious] Redditors around the world, what in your country is completely inauthentic, yet tourists fall for it?	The Plymouth Rock. It's a 2'x3' engraved rock moved from about where the pilgrams *may have* landed. Essentially just a rock from the harbor. Plymouth Plantation is worth a go, though.	The southwest of the united States: We dug the grand canyon its man made. Look into the works program as part of the great depression recovery. A team dug the canyon starting in 1933 it completed in 39 and was scheduled to be filled back in in 1942 but world war two happened the depression ended and all the labor was shipped out to fight Hitler . so now we have a giant ditch where we send tourists.	1
You awake one morning to find you have 10 skill points to assign to your life, no one ever told you about it, what skills do you increase?	Is discipline a skill? If so, +10 discipline. This would be such a huge quality of life improvement for me. It would help me get my weight under control, start working on things when I should, exercise properly, and so on and so on.	"This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name"	1
Reddit, what is your greatest college story?	I fell for the god damned financial trap that is college. Seriously, two and half years and I still haven't even had a class remotely related to my major(s). This world has such little value for those who are simply good, hard workers, everyone just wants a degree nowadays which half the time, proves nothing. I work two jobs at over 60 hours a week in an attempt to pay for college, and it obviously affects how I do in school. If you're gonna make it so god damned expensive and time consuming, give those who actually work their ass off a bit of a break, rather than those kids who have their college payed for, where all they need to do is regurgitate information to get a good grade. Unfortunately, even just working a shit ton, I know I'm going nowhere, so I have no choice.	While I was in graduate school, a man I was dating took me to a party at a friend's house. She lived with two other women, both undergraduate students...and one of those women, Janet, was celebrating her 21st birthday at the party. One of her gifts was a bag of 'shrooms, and she decided she'd chop some up and put them on a salad (to trip in a more healthy fashion). Janet was walking around the party getting slowly fried, munching her salad in a bowl. The doorbell rang, and she walked over to answer the door. Where her parents, grandmother, and youngest brother stood, surprising her for her birthday. They were delighted that she was already dressed up, smiled at everyone at the party, then took her to the best restaurant in our college town. I gather it was a very, very long dinner.	0
What has put a smile on your face today?	My 2yr old daughter was holding her sunglasses and bent the arms in to form a triangle. She then said, "Triangle. Daddy, triangle. I made a triangle."	Woke up to my girlfriends period blood all over the sheets. It was pure bliss laying in her blood, rubbing my dick thinking of her menstruation.	1
It blew my mind when I learned that your foot is always the same length as your forearm. Reddit, what are your favorite fun facts?	If you hold a cricket off the ground and blow on its head, the cricket thinks its flying and starts beating its wings.	The distance from the tip of your thumb to your first knuckle is (near enough) 1 inch. In many European countries the word for inch is the same or similar as the word for thumb.	1
What tv show should've stopped at the end of the first season?	*Heroes* should have been an anthology show. The problem was that they didn't want to let go of their two breakout characters, Peter and Sylar, so they had to come up with increasingly convoluted ways to escape their power creep. If they'd flown up into the air and exploded and that was that -- have a nice day; come back next year for new characters -- the show could have run for years without feeling stale.	Big Bang Theory. > What tv show should have stopped ~~at the end of the first season?~~ before it even started? (FTFY)	1
What is one thing your SO hid from you until later in the relationship?	After a month of dating my girlfriend told me her and her best friend had had an evening where they made out and almost had sex years ago. Almost five months later I found out it wasn't an evening but three whole weeks of kissing and touching eachother. I was pretty pissed off she kept that hidden.	My wife didn't know until 3 years into our marriage that I once worked as the ballon animal guy in a Mexican restaurant. It came up in conversation one day and she commented on how dorky those guys are. So I went to the storage closet, got out my balloons and made here a dragon. She almost pissed herself laughing.	0
Lawyers of Reddit - what is the worst example you know of "I'm not saying it's right, but it's the law"?	In Toronto if you tell a landlord that you have pets, he can deny you from renting. However if you don't mention that you have pets, and then move in the next day with 10 dogs the landlord can't evict you. Only condos that are pet free can add into a lease that you can be evicted for bringing pets.	In League of Legends, if you're stuck in a game with 4 people who are intentionally feeding and you say one word expressing your dismay, your account will be suspended, not theirs.	1
People who’ve had sex, what is something you want to tell virgins?	Even if you have to pay for it, get it over with. Your butthole will probably never unclench if you never have sex with a woman and the weight of your virginity could easily lead you to a life **you do not want.** Try, for the love of god, boys and girls and uncertain, have some sex (unless you don't want to, of course) and get that out of the way, there are so many bigger problems out there that will end up in your way.	Don’t stress being a virgin. The only reason it seems it’s weird is because other people who are probably virgins but lie about it troll you about it. Go at your own pace.	0
In what situation did you have to lower your standards?	Whenever I've had to take a dump at a music festival - there comes a certain point where the grossness of the port-a-john beats shitting your pants.	My ideal guy would have to make more than me (and I already make in the top 15% of my generation), have a degree from a top-level school like me, and would ideally be a 6-6-6 (six feet, six pack, six figures) Jewish guy. Took a chance on a teacher. I make more than double what he does, he went to a state school, and he's a fit and attractive agnostic. I've never been so happy with anyone in my entire life. Turns out those other things really don't matter.	1
Reddit, what's the most awkward situation you've found yourself in while with a friend's or significant other's family?	My ex boyfriends grandmother was in and out of the hospital for various ailments (both real and imagined) during the time we were dating. She also developed Alzheimers and went from being extremely lucid to fearing that she was going to die at any moment. We went to visit her in the hospital once and the moment I walked in she grabbed my hand, stared straight into my eyes, and told me that they were all trying to kill her. She begged me to look inside of her vagina for the probe that they had inserted to spy on her. Awkward doesn't even begin to describe that conversation.	Edited for clarity. I was at my boyfriends house when we first started dating I had never had to meet a mom before so I was incredibly nervous. His dad told a story about how they used to go to the beach every summer and how his wife was the most beautiful woman on the beach. Which I thought was the sweetest thing. She says "I was fat!" and he's like no you weren't and she's like "I was ### pounds" and I said "well you look great now" and she said "well that's because I'm anorexic." My jaw dropped and I felt like I could hear the crickets outside. I just said the first thing that came to my mind which was "wow that's a bummer". I think she laughed but I still felt like a total idiot.	1
What is perfectly acceptable in your culture, but offensive in others?	*Thumbs up* America: "Oh okay, he's good. I can cut in front of him. He's letting me in." Iran: "That guy wants to play with my asshole." Edit: Thanks to globalization, it has lost most of its insult status.	Police shooting unarmed and/or innocent people. Cops in Georgia blew up a toddler with a friggin' grenade because they broke into his house looking for someone who didn't even live there.	1
What comedy/comedian have you never found funny?	Dane Cook, Dave Chappelle, Sarah Silverman, John Oliver, and last but not least (and i'm so sorry reddit) Louis Ck	Two Broke Girls recently went to TBS. I figured I'd give it a shot. That show is aggressively unfunny. Like, almost insultingly so.	0
At what moment did you realize your date was a horrible person?	She told a story about how someone she supervised had asked for a holiday off verbally. She said it was fine. Then a friend invited her to a get together for that holiday. She really wanted to go, so she pretended that she didn't remember approving verbally and denied his written request so she could take time off instead.	I don't know if this makes him a horrible person.. I was pretty drunk and wanted Wendy's because I hadn't had it in months. I didn't actually think he'd take me to get it, but he did. He drove a Mustang and was kind of a "bro". At the drive-through, the cashier compliments the car and asks if he would let me drive it and he goes "nah she's too busy stuffing her face." Just kind of rubbed me the wrong way for a first date. We went on a second date and I hated every second of it. He was so absurd. Edit: I didn't freaking care that I couldn't drive his car, people. I just didn't really like the "stuffing my face" comment. That's something you say when you're close friends with someone. Even so, I wouldn't say that to a friend because of what it insinuates.	1
If you could write (or re-write) the ending to any tv series, what would it be?	Quantum Leap - [I would have let Sam exit the machine, rather than re-entering and continuing to leap for eternity. Damn it the guy had spent 7 years fixing history's problems - let someone else do it.](/spoiler)	The Jersey Shore. The final episode would involve the entire cast and every son of a bitch responsible for that peice of shit being arrested. The second half of the show would simply be violent prison rape. 30 minutes, no commercial interruptions. Just them being raped physically the way they raped America mentally.	1
What is the biggest misconception people have about you?	Most people just see me as a chiseled, beautiful man, with a high intellect. What they don't know is I also have a really great penis. This is the internet, and I get to choose my reality, damnit!	That because I'm so good looking and fit I must be a model. No, people, I don't get paid to look this good. I do it as a public service.	1
What is something you're extremely proud of doing, but are too embarrassed to talk about it?	I'll probably delete this later but I've had motor issues my entire life, and one of the biggest challenges for me was washing my hair (I've tried so so so many times, I could never get the soap out or I wouldn't wash correctly and I'd have half dirty hair) I finally started motor therapy a month ago or so, and after 18 years I'm finally able to wash my hair on my own. This makes me super happy because I really missed the feeling of having warm water on my head and face and I like being able to clean my hair when I want to. I'm very proud of myself and I'm excited to wash my hair again tomorrow! (My mom is a hairstylist so she would always just wash my hair in the sink)	The relationship I have with my bf, it's the kind of mature love that hardly anyone at 18 have. We plan to marry as soon as we graduate and get a job. It's a long way down the road, and there are risks too, but we are trying hard. I'm not embarassed talking about my relationship. However, the way people are jealous or underestimate our love, it makes me feel uncomfortable.	1
Prison cell guards of Reddit, what is the most disgusting thing you've seen a prisoner do in his cell?	I've seen plenty of butt stuff, even spit-roasting on commissary day. There was the constantly masturbating, shit-eating psycho, but one of the strangest was a guy who would stock up on big trash bags, carefully roll them up and melt the outside smooth to make giant butt plugs. Yeah, lots of butt stuff.	(If you want better answers probably don't use the term "prison cell guards." Correctional Officer or CO is the right term; prison guard is outdated. ) A lot of non-compliant inmates like to cover themselves and their cell with feces and urine because if you send in a cell extraction team they're harder to hold onto. And its really fucking gross.	1
At what moment did you realise that you were in love with your SO?	When I said, "I have been wanting to say this for a while. I.... really, really like you...? Really." And he said, "I love you too."	When she gave me permission to blow a guy so I could steal his wallet. I took her out for ice cream with the money.	1
Black women of Reddit! I am a white male that is only attracted to black women. Should I ever admit this to you?	I think it's great that somebody likes us around here ... but I would be careful of any statements that imply that your interest is a fetish.	Well I think it's like that one day at the swimming pool. I was swimming and saw this girl, and I could have sworn I knew her. I swam up to her and she immediately began kissing me. We both happened to be in Boston at the time, and she was my crush. I didn't recognize her at first. We ended up going out and ever since I am now engaged to her.	1
Redditors, what is something an interviewer did that turned you off from the job?	Tried to get in the local lineworkers union as an apprentice. After doing really well on the admission test I sat at the interview and heard them tell me once in this union I could not do (from what I remember) any electrical work for pay that wasn't union. Their final question was about my criminal history, I was ready to leave at that point so I gave them all my dirt.	Any time the interviewer is more excited about paying to wear jeans for casual Friday than the actual benefits, it’s a bad place to work.	0
Reddit, if you could replace one body part with an animal's body part, which animal, what part and why?	I think i'd want to have a tail for no apparent reason just to see why cats/dogs/other tailed animals like to play with them	I would replace my butt with an elephant trunk so I could shit like I pee...It's my cakeday can I have gold now?	1
What's the most accidentally inappropriate thing you've ever done?	I was waiting tables one day when it was super packed and our wait was about 45 minutes. I had a 10 top come up and had to seat them myself because the hostesses were completely overwhelmed. The spokesman for the group was a GIGANTIC guy, easily weighing 350 lbs. I introduced myself to the group and asked them how they were doing. The spokesman says "ready to sit down". I reply "I bet you are". Wide eyes all around.	I was on a metro with my friend and I was ridiculously close to this girl (because it was crammed). My friend shows me a picture of me from the night before and I say man I'm so chink eyed there. Obviously this girl turns and looks at me with a dirty look - and of course she was asian. Anyways, it made for an awkward ride. I pretended like nothing happened.	1
Redditors who marched today or were affected by it, what was your experience like?	I marched my fat ass down to the store for some chips and a beer. It was a pretty good experience, the chips were on sale.	I saw a woman carrying that stitched sign that was on the front page a couple of days ago, the one that said "I'm so angry I stitched this just so I could stab something 1,000 times." Not sure if it was the same one that was one Reddit, but it was funny seeing it in real life.	0
I just discovered a diary from when I was 15 and hated the person I saw. Reddit, how far have you come, and how bad did you used to be?	When I was about 15, I remember the first line of my "diary" (which I called a journal to be manly) was: Laura slept with Adam. I want to run into the ocean so my tears would seem smaller. I know, right?	Oh man. It's crazy how different I am. I don't evne know how I would compare the two. I've come so far, and fought so hard to get where I am now.	1
Truckers of Reddit, have you ever gotten spooked or creeped out while parking overnight somewhere? If so what happened?	I used to haul saltwater off of wellsites in Oklahoma on the night shift. I was standing at the rear of my trailer as I was loading out in BFE somewhere when I heard gravel crunching like someone was walking towards me. Got that feeling where you feel you're being watched. Stepped around the trailer towards the sound and shined my flashlight at a cow licking the side of my trailer.	As a truck driver, this is a regular fear of mine. Especially since I have no other job experience to turn to when I hang up the drivin' cap.	1
Is there anyone on reddit that can describe visual hallucinations that are the result of mental illness (not drugs)? Were they ordinary things you realized later you interpreted incorrectly, or were they brand new images that simply showed up in the room?	They are usually auditory hallucinations, or feeling like some presence is there with it's attention on you. Visual hallucinations like you see in A Beautiful Mind are not an accurate depiction of mental illnesses like schizophrenia.	I myself have Schizophrenia, I've only hallucinated once, mostly everything was auditory for me. I had just checked into the psych ward and all of the sudden "Joshua" showed up, he told me he was this voice in my head that had been tormenting me for about a year, told me I was stupid for being here, he'd find a way to kill me either way. He was wearing a long black trench coat, much like an old western badass cowboy , he was so real and honestly it was a relief to finally see a face for this voice. I really don't like talking about it, but he was as real as if you yourself were standing right next to me. Took a nurse and some benzos about an hour to calm me down.	0
Why do some teachers push quiet kids to talk so much?	I think there's a certain kind of idiocy within the system that punishes introverted children. It's an idiocy that says if you're quiet and humble, you should be embarrassed and at every available opportunity. It's an idiocy that rewards loud, obnoxious people. They do it because they think they're helping them speak out and improve their speaking ability. In actual fact, they're destroying the quiet person's confidence by forcing them to talk. Quiet people are among the best and the brightest, but teachers don't have the time to help them and so try to elicit a response in the worst possible way.	Ignoring the "life skills" angle for a minute, there are two valuable educational reasons to call on quiet students. First- See what they have to say. If only the loudest and most outgoing dominate a discussion, it'll sound the same way every time. I feel like, as a redditor, you might know what I mean? Second- Make sure the student understands the material. Sure, maybe the kid is just being quiet, but maybe he's also hopelessly lost and is either trying to catch up, or figure out what everyone else is talking about. By calling on the student, you can often gauge if they've been paying attention and if they understand the current material.	0
What are you a snob about?	Brats. Prepare them however you want, but if you pick any other brand than Johnsonville, you're just plain doing it wrong.	clotheshangers. fuck the pastic clotheshangers. they break if you put heavy shit on them, and they warp, and they suck. All wood coathangers in my closet. I replaced my last plastic one a few months ago and now my closet is a place of luxury. Frankly wooden ones last longer too. I don't expect I'll have to buy more clotheshangers for a decade or more.	0
Commuters of Reddit, what tricks would I need to know to get through your commute every morning?	My business is an under one minute walk from my condo, but you can cut that time in half by going through the lobby in tower 65.	I drive about an hour each way, every day. I noticed that it became much better once I just came to peace with it and stopped thinking about how much it sucks. I just listen to the radio/music and let it happen. It's just a fact of life for me now.	0
For the past two years I have been sharing my Netflix account with a stranger (who hacked it) and we recommend movies to each other. Reddit, what crazy stories do you have that deal with strangers that you will never meet, see, or talk with again?	I met a woman named Beth after she dialed the wrong number trying to reach her nephew, who, oddly enough, had the same name as myself. We talked for quite a while, her asking questions about how my family was, how I was, etc all while I'm thinking "Who IS this?! They know my name....must be a friend of moms or something...." before we realized her mistake. She even called back a week or so later to see if I'd had any success with my interview and to talk a bit more.	In high school a recruiter from a religious college called me and we had a 4 hour conversation about Christianity. I destroyed her faith in god.	1
Felons of Reddit, what jobs do you have?	High school dropout > felony drug charge with jail > dead end landscaping/restaurant/retail jobs > rehab > more dead end restaurant jobs > drug rehab > more drug rehab (finally quit- age 23) > GED > college (undergrad)- loans/scholarships/restaurant/retail > college (masters) - loans/scholarships/assistantship > full pardon from governor > college (Ph.D.) - loans/scholarships/assistantship> job (research associate) > job (analyst) > job (senior analyst). What a long strange trip it's been!	I work closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigations and assist them with capturing White Collar criminals. I do so with my expertise in art and securities.	1
Dear Reddit: If you had 6 months of free time what will you do to improve yourself?	I recently had about 8 months of free time between my current job and my last job. When it started I was all like "Oh yeah, I'll have plenty of time to go to the gym and actually get decent at cooking, maybe get some certifications I've been putting off." Nope. I basically spent 24/7 of those 8 months sitting on my ass playing video games. And it was awesome. If I could go back and do it again, I wouldn't change a thing.	That depends on what "free time" means. I simply don't have a job? I find one. I have savings or a basic wage that would cover my usual bills (but not much else)? I'd work on my side project harder and try to get it to a main job. I have any and all expenses paid, no matter what? I would immediately buy a storefront and tons of toys and games to sell, so I can keep growing after the 6 months is over.	1
What is the sentence (from a book, a film, a song, whatever) you will never forget?	"Oh yeaaaaah! Stick that in my butt. Let me feel your hobbit. Oh yeah! Put your finger in my one ring!" - The Hobbit: An Unexpected Porno.	Many that live deserve death. And some die that deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then be not too eager to deal out death in the name of justice, fearing for your own safety. Even the wise cannot see all ends. J.R.R. Tolkien	0
What thought spirals you into an existential crisis?	We're all just stuck being alive till we're dead. Assuming you don't have the balls to end your own life. You don't have a choice. You don't get a break. You have to wake up, you have to sleep, you have to earn money to stay alive, you have to do everything. You don't have another option. Life itself enslaves you for decades, sometimes more. And you only have one other option.	Now that the joys of childhood, the adventures of youth, and the struggles of college have past and I have plunged into adult life, is *this* really what the fuck I will be doing every day for the rest of my life?	0
What scam did you fall for?	I was very little and playing a shitty chinese mmo. Some random guy introduced himself as an Admin and sent me a programme link to enter my id and password so he could log in to my account and give me free items. He had perfect grammar and me, a dumb little kid was fascinated and immediately did as he said so. My account wasn't even worth much my level was low etc. Anyways I learned about the internet that day.	All my childhood, there was this girl who lived near me. This is hard for me to say. Our neighborhood used to be very social, and the kids would play together whenever. Yet every time this girl came to me, she brought a football, and told me to try to kick it while she held it. Not once did I kick that football. Not once did she let me taste glory. Never again will I forget her laugh when she pulled the ball out from under me, never again.	1
What is a creepy/seedy thing that you do reddit?	Dear OP: That's actually hilarious and I don't find that creepy or seedy at all. I'm sure your friends might think differently but who cares! I would have a great time making up back stories for my friends.	I constantly objectify men, as a fairly prim and proper young woman, it's really bad. I'm outwardly very professional but I can't meet a new guy at work without instantly performing a sexual assessment on him (checking him out, would I sleep with him - yes/no, sometimes wondering what he's like in bed/if he has a big willy). I can't help looking at men in public all the time in a really lecherous way that would be gross if a 40 y/o man did it to a 21 y/o girl, and yet it's the other way round, and I feel like a massive hypocrite. To me, men are beautiful and I love looking at them as much as their company. I never act on it, or be crude or obvious about it, but I am a raging pervert.	0
I just got confronted in the break room about my facial hair. What petty and stupid acts of dominance have you all encountered at work?	I found a private diary of personal gripes about me that my manager wrote up. Then locked in the filing cabinet. Not work related shit either. Just things I did that bugged her. It was rough because It was a tiny pet food store and it would just be the two of us sitting there. with no customers for hours. And then I realize all the time she's spending in the bathroom, it her writing shit about me. When I thought about it, she was even doing it sitting on bags of dog food next to me. I couldn't believe it.I eventually told her I knew about them and she was red paint pink in the face.	I had another employee try to assert dominance over me because she's 3 days older than me. I'm a male, I obviously have dominance over her.	1
To NonAmerican Redditors. When you learned about world war 2 in school did you focus on the USA's involvment at all? What did you focus on in your WWII education?	Canadian here. We learn about how we fought for most of the war unlikely the selfish Americans who profited off the war until they got attacked then they nuked civilians and only started fighting Germans when the war was practically wrapping up anyways. They helped but weren't heroes and them being there definitely didn't win it. Also Canada had a reputation as being one of the bravest countries and winning the unwinnable battles	South African here. Basically we were told Hitler lost because who the fuck gets himself into a war against the US and Russia at the same time? Or, to put it another way: we were basically told that American money, Russian blood and a bit of British brains (Turing) won the war.	0
What theories/ concepts/ ideas just completely blow your mind?	That the entire system of 'mathematics' that we have today evolved out of our ability to recognize 'one-ness,' 'two-ness,' and so on. The idea that this wholly man-made, completely abstract construction called 'math' holds secrets we haven't even figured out yet is pretty astounding.	This was I the front page literally not 24 hours ago! Probably still was on less than 12 hours ago! Come on! Wait at least half a week before posting someone's question again!	1
What quote changed your perspective on life?	"We have a tendency to want the other person to be a finished product while we give ourselves the grace to evolve."	In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony god’s blessing. But because, I am enlightened by my intelligence. ~ A. A. Lewis	1
[Serious] Redditors that have tried to commit suicide. How are you?	My third year anniversary of attempt is coming up. I feel much better now. On a good med that keeps my head straight. People need to understand that if someone commits suicide, they are not right in the head.	I'm better now. Thanks for asking. What was in my mind? Hhmmm.... That I was a complete loser. A failure as a son, as a brother, as a student, as a friend. Just a total failure of human being. All I could feel was deeply dark feelings, all i could think was deeply dark thoughts. And I wanted out When I held the gun all I could think was that it was finally time to end the suffering. It was my choice to do it. Mine and mine alone. What stopped me? Nothing....I brought the gun to my head and pulled the trigger but the gun did not fire. What stopped me later? IDK.... I lost my nerve to do it I guess. Later I've become a dad, now my love and dedication to my son keeps me around	0
Reddit, what is the weirdest thing you have ever seen someone do when they think no one is looking?	While driving one day, I saw a guy in the car next to me having a very heated argument with a sock puppet.	Not me but my friend witnessed this... He was walking home from school one day when he saw a guy stop and go into the post office.As he was walking past the car he saw this huge woman,pants fully off,masturbating. His eyes bugged out of his head, he screamed shielded his eyes and yelled, "that's fucking sick lady! You know people can see you?! and proceded to run away. He said it would have been hot if she were pretty but that bitch was nasty.	1
Landlords of Reddit, what was/is your worst tenant experience?	-Grandmother has tenant from hell, finally gets rid of her -My parents rent their basement, unknowly to same women -Uncle visits, recognizes her, but it's already too late. -Tenant isn't aware of the connection -Second months rent comes, she's out of town -Doesn't show up until a few weeks later, comes home in the middle of the night with the locks changed and eviction notice on the door. -freaks her shit, rings door bell to wake my parents -"YOU CAN'T DO THIS!! I LIVE HERE!!" -parents call cops -parents say she's trespassing -woman gets arrested -ruined her Christmas holidays	Work in Property Management, I have some stories. One guy had business associates pose as renters and rented out a whole building through 3 separate people. Tore down every wall, including load bearing walls and turned the first two floors into a nightclub/disco. Leasing agent found tons of white powder sitting around his third floor office. Dominatrix renting out a unit as an office. Very attractive early 20's girl who was secretly stealing and hoarding cats. Indian family of 3 who rented out a 3 bedroom, and when it came time to move out there was obviously like 20+ people living there. They tore down the doors to the den, laid cots and makeshift beds everywhere (there was no living room, the whole house was basically just sleeping space) and added a makeshift stove with 5-6 electric burners which was crazy.	0
People who have been to the live taping of a show, what did you see that the TV audience didn't?	Some shitty "talent" show on fox or nbc. Don't even remember which. Anyway they kept having to reshoot the scene when they announced the winner so the judges kept having to re-act all surprised and excited and the audience too. Overall about 6 times. It was pretty sad	They film more than one episode in a day. And when they “go to commercial” they just take like a 30 second intermission and then start filming again. I went to Wheel of Fortune years ago on a school field-trip.	0
"She got a big booty so I call her big booty" It boggles my mind to think rappers make millions of dollars off of lyrics like this. What other mindless rap lines have you heard that make you shake your head in disbelief?	Ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass	How about Gucci Mane's song "Lemonade". Here's an excerpt from the song. *Lemonade diamond bracelet, put it in your face,* *Lemonhead diamond earrings I wore yesterday,* *I'm pimpin' where I'm winnin', that's just how I'm chillin',* *I'm smoking grits and sellin' chickens, corvette painted lemons.* Seriously, how is this called music?	1
What do you do on long flights?	Last time I flew back to Europe from the USA i used my flight as the first night to adjust my sleep schedule. You get shit sleep in a plane anyway, so if you are flying eastward and are losing time, just set an alarm to the new time you need to get up at (I set it to 11am european time which is 4am where I left). Helped me not get a jetlag at all. The time you are awake you can read books, listen to music (there's always one or two albums I discover when I fly on a plane) or watch a movie. Also, walk around a little and stretch your arms and legs if the flight is very long.	download a flight simulator, use the exact same plane you're in with the same weight, and fly the plane along with the pilot. Beat the pilot. When you land, show him that you did a better job than he did and got to the destination quicker.	0
Redditors,what's the stupidest thing you've said to a police officer?	"I haven't been pulled over in years" "You got a ticket this morning!" "Uh... I didn't think that would be in the system so soon"	I did a rolling stop and got pulled over. He ended up giving me a warning and I said "Hey, thanks buddy". I hear they hate being called buddy. I would've said 'officer', but that's not in my vocabulary.	1
Hey, Reddit! Can we as a community take more steps to protect ourselves from people who see this site as an opportunity?	I think we should create this place as a community where anyone is allowed to submit a subject, thought, or idea and the merits of it are judged by the whole community using an upvote/downvote system. Oh wait.....	I'm behind you 100%. This was why I removed the head shave girls posts from askreddit (one of the reasons)	1
What are some secrets about widely used products?	There's an ingredient in bagels, bread, and pizza dough called L-cysteine. L-cysteine is frequently sourced from human hair. If not, it's from hog hair or duck feathers.	The samples of cleaning products are much more potent than the stuff you buy. My dad's company makes the spray bottles they use. They send samples to test the sprayers because the over the counter versions are more watered down. If you send them an email saying you like their products they will often send you samples in the mail!	0
NSFW What is a question you are embarrassed to ask in real life?	Do feminists actually like to be outraged? I swear, it seems like the ones I know **actively look for** the smallest minute things to be pissed off about Edit: I keep forgetting that, in reality, the loudest ones get the most attention	Do those *I* see as my closest friends see *me* as a close friend or just "one of the group"?	0
Men of Reddit, When was the last time you cried?	When I heard my father died after I missed the last phone call he made to me and I never called him back.	For me it was about a month or so ago, I was on YouTube watching some Fresh Prince clips and the one where his dad finally comes to see him. He basically bails again after planning something fun and Will has a break down to Uncle Phil. Really sad, touching scene!	1
What was a time when you used a sex move you saw in a porno in real life and it ended horribly?	My husband is really into "stripper porn". I tried to recreate a move where the man was sitting in a chair and the stripper does a handstand, thighs resting on the guys shoulders, her cooch in his face. Then she twerks. Almost like a seated 69. Lighting and music are perfect. I ask him to sit down, do a little floor show. Then I pull out my big move, execute it perfectly except as begin to twerk I let out the loudest queef right in his face.	I had a lemon tree in my backyard. Some girl was out there picking lemons without my consent, so I fucked her. Now I'm doing 5 to 10 for rape.	1
What are some "tall people" problems?	I'm 6'2". That's not *particularly* tall, though it's above average. Unfortunately, it's *also* the number - for some reason - that shorter guys use when they lie about their height. Seriously, think about it: Nobody ever claims to be 6'1" or 6'3"; it's *always* 6'2". As a result, those of us who *really are* that tall get seen as being liars, simply because we tell the truth about our height. There's also the problem that quite a few folks apparently don't know what 6'2" actually looks like - probably as a result of the measurement's misuse - and they often try to insist that I *must* be taller than I'm saying. Maybe I should just start claiming I'm 6'6" and have that average out to the truth.	Tall male here. I hate standing up after using the bathroom in a stall and being able to see over. It's really awkward when people look back up at you. EDIT: I am proud to say that my now most upvoted post is about what it's like to stare down another man after taking a quality shit. **THANK YOU REDDIT!**	0
You are immortal now, what is your long game?	Lay perfectly still at the bottom of a shallow river bed for a million years until I'm fossilized then scare the shit out of some archeologist when I scream in his face as he's digging me up. It's just a prank bro!	Figure out how to undo this whole immortality thing. I can think of no punishment more horrible for a sentient being than immortality.	1
[Serious] Why is Obamacare hated so much when the rest of the developed world loves socialized healthcare?	I don't disagree, but this is not really why most opponents of Obamacare are opposed to it. Most Americans people support it. Let's call them Group A. Some of those supporters don't think it goes far enough. Some people, Group B, don't support it because they follow conservative/right wing/Republican ideologues. In fact, Obamacare includes aspects of health policies developed by Republicans. Then some people don't support it because they want true socialized health care. Let's call this Group C. I am too lazy to cite actual figures, but my impression is that Group A is the largest, then B, then C. So to the degree that Obamacare is hated, that hatred is driven by conservative/Republican politics with little regard to facts or logic.	The ACA (Obama care) is not socialized medicine - and that is the problem. All it is, is a set of regulations governing healthcare insurance, combined with some subsidies to help some of those who can not afford to pay for healthcare insurance.	0
What are the differences of etiquette between male and female locker rooms?	Do women in the locker room completely strip down, put their leg up on a bench, and proceed to lotion themselves all over for at least 20 minutes?	When you get an erection in the men's locker room, nobody brings it up. When you get an erection in the women's locker room, you're a pervert. What the hell is up with that?	1
What's a belief you used to hold but changed your mind about?	Feminism. Male who used to be in favor of fighting for equality and what not (still believe in equality) but the mainstream movement has moved away from all that and I rather find modern feminists to just be annoying as they find a way to play victim through literally every situation and turn everything into a battle of the sexes.	Being alone is actually quite relaxing. I always thought it was only depressing, but as I got older I started to enjoy tranquility	0
What weakens your willpower the fastest?	Hopelessness. When I'm staring at a mound of work knowing that I have no chance in hell of getting it all done, I find myself on reddit and figure it's better to deserve the shit I'm about to catch rather than work my ass off to get half of it done and catch shit for not finishing.	Second comment here...I hate it when i get 50 comments on a submission but only 3 upvotes. Seriously, if you comment, upvote it or downvote.	1
What's your strange addiction?	Alcohol. It's a common addiction yes but it's still strange because I look after myself pretty well because I want to live long but I still drink lots, all the time. It makes no sense but I can't stop.	It's not strange since there's like a word for it but I'm addicted to like, picking or peeling off dead skin. Mainly on my hands or feet or lips and mostly til I bleed.	0
What's a phenomenon you think is so common that it deserves its own name?	When you have a few friends over to hang out, and instead of talking, everyone starts using thier smartphone or tablet.	When you're walking towards a person and you both try to move out of the way in the same direction.	0
Women of Reddit: What is one style/clothing mistake men do that you find horrible?	What's that hair-do where it's like a pompadour but with either side shaved off? like poofy Mohawk. Ew. That, and extra long hair I find particularly off-putting. I don't care how edgy it is.	Premature manbuns. These guys with a single pigtail atop their head and just in complete denial that to accomplish the hairstyle you actually need the hair itself..	0
Would You Spend Two Years in Solitary Confinement for $22 million?	I think knowing I was going to get $22 mil after 2 years in solitary would probably give me plenty of incentive to get through it. This guy certainly didn't have that luxury. Side Note: No guarantees he will ever see the money, this will be tied up in appeals forever.	$22,000,000 isn't as much as it used to be. I'm not going to risk going crazy and becoming a hollow shell of who I was for an amount that may not even last me my entire life.	1
How would you feel about Presidential Debates cutting the mic feed when a candidate’s time is up, or when it’s not their turn to speak?	I'm all for this. It's not like there is some technological barrier. Give them a response window, and a bucket of overage time to use throughout the debate. Once you use it, your fucking mic gets cut after your response window. Welcome to the big leagues.	They should cut out the tongue of the first person that spoke over and i think that might solve the problem.	1
I have family members who "save" money by buying terrible 1 ply toilet paper. Reddit, what money saving practices that people use do you find to not be worth the savings?	knock off condiments. Ketchup that taste like tomato water. Mayo is just nasty, get miracle whip. BBQ sauce with no taste. Either get the real stuff or don't get it at all.	Cheapass thin black garbage bags. My sister buys them, and every time someone takes out the trash at her place, it's a gamble if the bag will hold together long enough without breaking. She's had countless bags break on her, but still she thinks she's saving time and money.	0
Girls, when the guys aren't around, what are your true thoughts on Pascal's principles of hydrostatics?	I asked 5 of my female coworkers and they said they don't really think about it at all, they're too busy wondering wondering what would be the best object to launch a 90kg projectile at the distance of over 300 metres.	... Not what we typically talk about, tbh. The last time I was alone with a bunch of girls, we fought over what to have for dinner for two hours, and I had to explain several entrees to a friend who had never had mexican food. Edit: Umm, I'm sorry?	1
Professors of Reddit, what are the strangest papers you've ever had submitted?	I taught a high school class on paper-writing, so the focus was on structure more than content. I'd give a few categories and they could basically write about whatever they wanted. One kid compared how different US states would fare in a zombie apocalypse, arguing that Texas was the place to be in that case. Not super unusual, but it was an entertaining read in the middle of 50-some mundane current events papers. EDIT: He got an A. It was a well-constructed paper.	For a GCSE Religious Education essay question I discussed how I believed the bible to be a collection of fictional stories and why I believe that to be true. I also balanced it out with why other people may disagree with me. I got an A*.	1
What do you still do exactly the same way you did when you were a kid?	Tie my shoelaces the bunny ear way. I'm in my 30s and still don't know how to tie them the way that most people do.	If mashed potatoes are on the dinner menu at my house with a vegetable I don't much care for, I'll do what I can to mix them together so I can taste mostly the potatoes and not the rotten broccoli /other disgusting healthy foods. I was eating at a fancy restaurant in downtown Phenix the other day and got some weird looks from the other patrons for cutting up and mixing in my asparagus. Not my date, but her friend gave me a handjob before we went in to relax me and I came on her legs. I know the chef wanted me to appreciate the asparagus on its own, but it just doesn't taste good to me, like a ton of other vegetables. Let me eat how I want and you're more likely to get a compliment.	1
If all humans disappeared today, and aliens show up tommrow, what place on Earth would be most mysterious to them?	If they're anything like *our* archaeologists, I'd say sex shops. "The people who lived here made intricate symbols and sculptures for their various fertility rituals, and kept them in shrines such as this one."	I don't know, but there would be so many ironic selfies taken in front of the world's various "Welcome, Aliens!" billboards.	1
Reddit, who is the absolute worst coworker you have ever had the displeasure of dealing with?	I used to work with a guy named Bill who was loud, disgusting, obnoxious about his religion, drank his own urine & raped cats.	I worked with one guy who'd go to the bathroom (the only one) in our office for ~45 minutes at a time, with a book and a screwdriver and after he'd return, the bathroom would smell of ammonia.	0
What's the dumbest thing the Internet convinced you to do?	Six months ago, a former friend of mine convinced me to join Gamergate. One month in, I realised what a hateful, vile harassment movement that was. We are no longer friends after he showed his true colours.	When I was younger, I wanted to join a Starcraft 1 clan I encountered. They had their own website which was pretty fantastic back in '98. They apparently had a blood feud going with another clan and on their website they had a button that said "Other clan" members click here. I was curious, so I did it.......and it crashed my computer. To this day I'm still curious as to what happened.	0
Teachers of reddit, what is the greatest way a student has misinterpreted one of your assignments?	A student of mine this year has, for years, apparently heard the phrase "Write in complete sentences" as "Write incomplete sentences." This explained a ton about why his answers to reading homework questions were 3-4 words, tops....	During a college presentation on euthanasia a student proceeded to give an hour lecture on " youth in Asia". It just went on, no one stopped her, no one laugh. It just...happened.	1
What popular movie has the biggest plot hole in it that no one seems to notice?	Either a plot hole or really stupid plotting: In TDKR, Bane breaks into the Gotham stock exchange in broad daylight and steals trading codes or some shit. The next day Bruce Wayne apparently makes an inexplicable stock purchase that threatens to tank Wayne Enterprises. Bruce is then thrown off the board in a 5 minute meeting - during which, no one brings up that maybe the masked terrorist who hi-jacked the stock exchange literally hours ago had something to do with it.	Independence day Computer nerd to the rescue muthaFUDGER! I got this virus for these aliens that'll fuck em up. But Goldblum, how will the virus be downloaded? Don't worry, I'll PLUG MY MAC INTO THEIR SYSTEMS	1
What are some stories of the weirdest people you've ever gone to school with?	I went to school with a kid from kindergarten through high school. He was a really bright kid who skipped a grade but he was pretty socially inept so he would get flustered easily. He used to run around shooting energy balls (dbz style) at people who would frustrate him from around 6th grade through our senior year. I'll never forget the day I saw him blast a girl with a kamehameha wave after she rejected him for prom.... She never saw it coming, Priceless.	My best friend had overprotective parents. One day we were outside of school playing basketball when some of the older kids start trying to fight him. His mom got scared and sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Bel Air.	1
Couples who lie about how you met, what's your real meeting story?	She was my coke dealer. We bonded while I helped her bag an ounce into grams. We had some crazy and tumultuous years, but after we both straightened our lives out we decided "we met at a house party" was close enough to the truth.	Met at retail job. Stole her from her boyfriend of 7 years. Told her she wasnt down to pound(Drink) Our first date we drank a 18 pack of tecate and we were still functioning. *Mr Steal yo girl*	1
[Serious] People who've "disappeared" to start over. How &amp; why did you do it &amp; what was the outcome?	I packed up all my stuff and moved to a different state because I had fallen in unrequited love with a girl and made a fool of myself and it was too painful to live with the consequences. I moved to a new city where I didn't really know anyone. I learned that no matter where you go, there you are. If you have regrets, or anxieties, those will still be with you in a new place. It's been 2 years and I really miss my friends, but I still have work to do on me, so I'm not ready to go back yet.	Pretty good , i got a girlfriend but she broke upwith me when sge dound out . This all happened recently so i still feel the pain.	1
[NSFW] What is your most shameful fap?	This isn't my story but I once read on here that when some guy was a kid, he fapped to his moms attractive best friend one night right before bed. When he woke up, his mom was crying and told him that she had committed suicide last night. He said that one still haunts him today.	These threads are so fucking tame on here compared to 4chan and the like. Drawings, the occasional relative nude pic, in the same room as grandma, blah blah blah. Yawn. I hope people just can't post their real answers because they don't want it associated with their username.	1
What's the creepiest things you've accidently discovered about your close friends?	Not a friend, but a teacher in high school. He told me and couple of friends outside of class about how he came to wear dentures: He was literally curb stomped for sleeping with another guy's girlfriend. That's horrible enough but the creepiest part was the nonchalant way he ended the story- "It hurt like hell, but I got him back pretty good with a shotgun." o.0 He ended up getting fired for picking up my friend out of his chair by the neck and choking him. Scary dude.	As someone who uses the birthdate of someone who I have feelings for who broken heart and hasn't spoken to me in 3 years, I don't appreciate everyone calling ops friend a rapist, or creepy. Could be any number of things being the reason for that number.	1
Non smokers of reddit, what is your honest opinion about smokers?	I love smokers. I don't judge them at all. I like the smell of cigarette smoke in the air. It doesn't bother me. What does bother me is non-smokers who take every opportunity to insult and look down on smokers as if there is something inherently bad about them. I've known a lot of good people that smoked.	"Stepping out for a smoke, boss." "Sure." **20 minutes later** "Stepping out for a smoke, boss." "Sure." **20 more minutes later** "Smoking, boss." "All right." **Me.** "Taking a breather, boss." "You had your one 10-minute break this shift an hour ago. Get back to work." Fu...	0
What shitty things did you do to your good friends as a child?	One time I was sleeping over at a friends house and I woke up with puke on & around where I was sleeping. My friend's parents sent me home and told my parents. I had to stay inside all day and rest and recover under my mom's care...but I wasn't feeling sick, and I had quite the appetite. Well my mom called my friends mom...and he wasn't feeling well at all. Turns out he puked on me in my sleep, didn't clean up after himself, and blamed me in the morning. I'll never get that summer day back. Thanks, "friend."	I put silly putty in her hair... It made her hair purple until it grew out. Her mom nearly killed me.	1
Parents of reddit, what is the most absurd thing you have found on your kids social media?	Not a parent yet, but the trend of the younger generations WATCHING other people play video games online, instead if playing the games themselves, is a weird one to me	Not technically a parent but an older sister, so my little brother when he was around 7ish had a search history of naked women and such. And when my mother found out and confronted him he cried and was saying he just wanted to be like Jack from the titanic by drawing naked women and he had a few pages of his attempted drawings	0
Teachers of Reddit what was a point where you just felt bad for a kid but couldn't do anything?	Not a teacher but knew one. She once told me a story about how this kid would arrive at school late pretty much every day. When she asked him why he would always say that his mom had been out the previous night or she just didn't feel like getting up. This hit me right in the feels, what can you do in this situation?	Had a 4th grade student who did not have food at home. One of my best students. This kid would scarf down school lunch, as it was often the only meal he got. I would sometimes buy him a 2nd lunch, and started bringing in a backpack full of food to get him through the weekends. He moved out of district about 3/4 of the way through the year, so I'm not sure what has happened to him since.	0
For those teachers out there, what are some stories about horrible parents you've had to deal with?	My mom is a kindergarten teacher, and she had this one terrible student who not only kicked her in the face while she was helping him with his work, but he actually stole her digital camera from her desk drawer (she keeps it at work to take pictures of kids' projects and events and stuff, to share with parents). His parents suggested that my mom shouldn't bend down to help students lest she be within kicking range, and to leave her valuables at home. WTF.	I'm not a teacher, but whatever: So we (highschool seniors on our last day of school) were partying in front of our school, drinking lots of beer(you can drink in public here) and just having fun as seniors do every year, kind of a tradition already. At the same time, some younger children(I'm talking ~14) were in trouble for smoking weed(In school?) and had their parents called over for a serious talk. apparently the parents said to the teachers that "If you can't keep the seniors from drinking, then why shouldn't my 14 year old smoke weed?!" tl;dr: only read last sentence. edit: not that I'm against smoking weed, but what kind of logic is this? and 14 is really a little too young.	1
What Video Game have you bought and regretted buying on the first day?	I bought some random Garfield game on the DS when I was like, 10... I ended up beating the game on the ride home from Wal-Mart and- well the game sucked. But I spent 20 of my own dollars on that shit. What a ripoff.	Final Fantasy 10 The voice acting was horrendous right from the start, the characters are whiny emo tropes, and there's zero exploration. I was extremely disappointed back then and I've still never finished the game.	1
Which subreddit turned from awesome to complete shit?	/r/fitness went from a great and helpful fitness promoting sub-reddit to a mess of fat acceptance, coddling, and circle-jerking of the most minor progress when it went default	/r/nosleep. It's been on a slow decline for a while and the stories aren't just as good as they used to be. :( "i heard a dish break downstairs, but i live in my moms basement - part 13"	0
What do people consider "low class", but really isn't?	Shopping at Wal*Mart. I have friends and coworkers who literally refuse to go there, say "It's crazy there, I don't want to risk it!" Get over yourself. It's just a fucking department store, same as Target or Kmart.	Buying the generic or store brand version of things. In 99% it cases, it’s the exact same thing, and it’s cheaper.	0
Dear lonely people of Reddit, how are you?	Girlfriend is on a week long trip to yellowstone. Day one is harder than I thought it'd be. Would be great if the Trove servers didn't blow though.	I feel like I miss people too much to where I become annoying. So I instead just hide away and wait for them to talk to me. But no one really does. So to answer the question. Saddened mostly. And I really wish I would stop falling in love with any girl that shows me attention.	0
What weird shit have you seen/heard happen in a subway?	On my way to work, walk into a car on the 1 Train (NYC) and find a (presumably) homeless woman squatting in the middle of the car, openly urinating on the bench seat. Did an about-face and took a seat in a different car.	The tube around comic con time is wild. You see see Naruto sitting on the central line at 8:00, Harry potter reading a metro on the District, Deadpool is always doing some weird shit on the tube. One year I was dark willow from Buffy (who looks like an aggressive af emo with black lipstick and black veins on my face) and I come from not a great area. It's fair to say that on that crowed af train journey during rush hour nobody sat near me thinking I was going to kill them or something. I also got some dirty af looks. Fun times	0
Company is threatening to sue me based on a bad yelp review. What do?	Stop what you are doing, and **PLEASE CONTACT A LAWYER IN YOUR AREA!** None here can guide you, and even if there are lawyers here, they are not your lawyer and have not reviewed the details of your case.	It's been shown time and time again that if the review is accurate and factual (which yours appears to be) that they can't do anything to you. In fact, I'd submit another review stating that the owner of the business called you and threatened you with a lawsuit.	0
What classic game needs a remaster?	Millennial Monopoly - you start with no money, the properties are unreasonably priced, no S O C I A L I S T government handouts as you pass go and the banker can just take as much money as they like with no repurcussions	Sid Meier's Pirates. Such a cool game with historical perspective, free will, and several different game play options including just being a trader.	0
What is your best "people skills" tip?	Try to make the other person feel important. For example, when calling customer service for a refund on a faulty anal plug, don't just say "Your shitty anal plug got stuck in my butt and now I need a new one AND money for the hospital bill!" you could say "I recently bought an anal plug from your company, and I think it might be defective. The flared base came off and it was lodged in my colon for a day before the doctors got it out. I really like the product, and would like a replacement, but I have lost some trust in your otherwise excellent brand. Is that something you can help me with?" Ask them for help and they'll probably send you lube too.	If you want to compliment someone, but can't think of anything good to compliment them on, ask them if they got a haircut.	1
Military members of reddit, what’s one thing you wish that you knew before joining?	I wish I knew that the United States military is a rabid capitalist and imperialist institution that has destroyed the lives, land, and homes of millions of people overseas and on its own colonized territory, with damage from their actions lasting for generations into the present day.	That Recruiters jobs are basically to funnel people into specific jobs that maybe they are down in numbers on... so that AMAZING job and skill-set that you are a perfect fit for with your test scores... is likely just Johnny Recruiter meeting his numbers.	0
Waiters of Reddit, what is the most awkward conversation you overheard at your table?	"son, youre 31, youre decently good looking, we signed you up for a bunch of dating sites and match sites, and we want you out of the fucking house" just the banter was hilarious	Not a waiter, but while working a counter, I saw a grown man kiss his 15+ year old son on the lips.	1
What do movies portray as positives that are negatives in reality?	Anti-cop, selfishness, taking the easy way out, breaking the law then rationalizing it with some weak "logic", blaming others for your own failures, glorifying of criminals.... etc.	Looking at the passenger for a long time while talking to someone. While it looks cool and immersive in movies, it just might be the biggest cause for accidents on the road in that universe.	0
Where is the most remote place on Earth you've ever been and what was it like?	I live and have grown up in this small town in Oregon. Pretty remote, terrible people. This one guy who grew up at the same time I did there, went on to some big fancy university, leaving our remote community. Went to study something bogus like Biology or something of the same nature. I think I saw him on TV during a football game..? Just dummies growing up here. Only alcohol and drugs here, good remote if you're into that sort of thing I guess.	Falkland Islands. It was bizarro-world. Imagine visiting England, but something is kind of off and people have pet reindeers leashed in their front yards. Also a whale skeleton. And a canon. And a horse with a fence that came up to my knees. And a yard with the worlds largest collection of garden gnomes.	0
What is the funniest thing you've ever witnessed right in front of you?	I was walking through my neighbourhood on a Sunday morning loudly singing, "Me say day, me say day O", and a Jamaican guy popped his head out of the trunk of a car and sang "Day light come and wan' go home." He had been packing the trunk or something and I couldn't see him, it was wonderful.	I was at a local pizzeria. There was, sitting at a table, a little girl, her mother, and her grandmother. The little girl was apparently learning "Mommy and Daddy have real names too." So grandmother asks the girl "What does Mommy call Daddy?" The girl didn't understand the question. Then grandmother asks the girl "What does Daddy call Mommy?" And her little face just lit up like a light bulb. She knew what Daddy calls Mommy, and in a nice clear voice, told us all that Daddy calls Mommy "Asshole."	1
What do you consider to be the worst movie you have ever watched?	**Men Who Stare At Goats** Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but still a relevant disappointment. With all that star power, I was expecting a better, more sensical plot line. Besides that I was bored out of my mind, which should never happen while watching a film.	Epic Movie. I waste a lot of time but after that I actually felt angry about the hour I'd just lost.	0
What's a skill you have that you'd rather not brag about?	I can make a balloon animal anything. Once people know, they constantly challenge you and there are constant invites to kids parties from friends of friends. I had an on-again/off-again thing with a professional magician for a while and he found it intimidating(I wish I was kidding). Unless I want to be a clown or meet someone with a balloon fetish, this is a completely useless skill.	i have an amazing trait that i can get gold whenever I post about it. Edit: ummm I was totally being retarded and I got GILDED!! I'm so excited!!!	1
What's the "girls don't fart" of everything else?	People that bully you or make fun of you are insecure about themselves and jealous of you Some people are just dicks..	Do you know why girls don't fart? It's because they never close their mouths long enough to build up the pressure.	1
Who are the "McDonalds" of each musical genre?	Eminem. He used to be the best(like McDonalds) but his later albums are of much lower quality compared to his three classics. However i will say, Recovery and MMLP2 are good albums, they just arent classic status or even near it. Although before i get accused of Eminem hating, he is Top 10 unarguably, top 5 arguably, and therefore best rapper arguably. And Lose Yourself is the best hip hop song ever made.	Top 40 pop band: Maroon 5. Not the best, but the songs are easy on the ears, and the lead singer is easy on the eyes. Not a Big Mac, but definitely a McDouble.	0
Has anyone ever had an extremely close friend want to suddenly stop all communication with you?	I am that friend, completely cut a girl off about half a year ago, reason was pretty simple, I was in the friendzone and it was absolutely devastating to my self-esteem.	My best friend from high school would vanish for months at a time in our early 20s. He would disappear, then show back up like everything was completely normal a few months later. I didn't really notice, as we were both really busy with college, work, girls, hobbies, whatever. In fact, I used to joke about how cool it was that we could pick right up after not speaking to each other for so long. Turns out he was battling with pill addiction, and wasn't just disappearing from my life, but from the world for those months at a time. Edited: clarity	0
What's a story you've been waiting to tell but no one ever asks it on r/askreddit?	I was at a festival and saw a guy hula hooping. An hour later still hooping. And still an hour later. I went over to him and grabbed the hoop - he was off his bonce on LSD and couldn't stop. He was exhausted. So I stopped a man hula hooping himself to death.	at my skate park a while back in summer there was the autistic kid w/scooter i was sketched about it but walked it off. the next day him and all of his autistic friends with scooters (about 10 friends) and they told me to fuck of and go jack my friends off in the parking lot (i had 1 friend with me at the time) when i asked them to move because one yelled scoot train and they all followed with this train of pure autism across the entire bowl for 30 mins basically letting me do nothing. and if that's not bad enough they were all salty 10 or 11 yo kids with their 500$ scooters while their F***ING PARENTS WATCHED (to clarify I skateboard)	1
What myth did a company invent to sell their products?	NBC created the myth that Donald Trump was a super successful billionaire real-estate tycoon that could wheel and deal like no other to help sell The Apprentice.	The inventors of OxyContin tried to convince the public that it was a addictive-free version of oxycodone. They blatantly lied and were sued for like $500 mil a while back.	0
Reddit,How old are you and what's the biggest current problem in your life?	24 and finding out where I want to go and what career path I need to take with my qualifications	At 28, I am about to move back into my moms house for the second time (temporarily this time) while my wife goes to basic. Oh yeah, we are trying to patch things up after I had a girlfriend and a wife for about 6 months. She knows everything. I never lied or tried to hide it. And I have two other kids from a previous marraige. I make a decent amount of money but put myself so far in debt I can't afford to live on my own. I barely am able to support the family of 5 I have. Geez, I could go on and on with this subject. I do recognize this is all my fault though.	1
Do you collect anything? If so, what? Why? How did it start?	Classic Vans sneakers and skinny ties. I suppose you can count solid colored dress shirts as well, given how everything ties together.	I collect grocery lists (if that's what they're called in English). Every time I go shopping, I try to check the carts for them. When I get home, I make myself a cup of tea, read them and try to imagine the person who wrote them. I once saw a message of a mother to her son on the back of a list. It ended with 'I love you!' and made me smile. I keep them in a book and read them again every once in a while.	0
Using only the word suggestion on your phone, what stories can you tell?	Am I going to be at Concord for the first time? Should I leave the room with a few weeks behind me? I've never seen that movie in my head and it hurts me so much. Once again, the only reason I know you guys wanna come over tonight is because of how refreshing my mom is. I promise to love you. Hear my voice. Get my rhythm.	I did this once as part of a writing prompt in my creative writing class in year 11 ... It ended up being a PG rated adult story involving a pot dealer and a shop lifter ...	1
What physical traits do you have that are unusual for your gender?	Body hair. I have thick, black hair and mostly pale skin, so yeah. I have a treasure trail, thick eyebrows, pubes that don't know where to stop and seem to be ultimately aiming to reach my knees, dark leg hair, and the occasional errant chest hair. I have a line of downy sort of hair all down the middle of my body too, and upper lip hair. Plucking and shaving is an occupation.	Well, I don't have anything unusual for my gender. However, if we're talking about race, I have Hazel eye colour. I'm asian. It's pretty muddy so if you're not looking close, you'll assume its just brown.	1
What are some common abbreviations used on reddit that a new redditor should know?	FTFY - fixed that for you OP - Original Poster OC - Original content AMA - Ask me anything IAMA - I Am A ELI5 - Explain like I'm 5 NSFW/NSFL - Not safe for work/life (counterparts SFW/SFL - safe for work/life) TIL - Today I learned IIRC - If I recall correctly TL;DR - Too long; didn't read SO - Significant others DAE - Does anyone else AFAIK - As far as I know SRS - Shit Reddit says IMO - In my opinion (or IMHO - In my humble/honest opinion) ITT - In This Thread MFW - My face when MRW - My reaction when IANAL - I Am not a lawyer IANAD - I Am not a doctor MIC - More in comments YMMV - Your mileage may vary [edit: corrected a mistake, added a couple. Thanks to the thread!]	ELIW: Explain like I'm a woman TIF: Today I fapped NSFE: Not safe for autists You should use those all the time of you want to fit in.	1
[Serious] Soldiers of reddit, how has military experience impacted your political views?	27 year old Marine vet here. 1 tour in Afghanistan. 1 tour in Guatemala. Currently attending a four year school. My outlook has changed from wildly liberal to much, much more conservative. I will say that I really hate the incessant bashing of the VA. Perhaps this is because I filed no claims for compensation and thus I don't deal with them very often. I think people in general are whiny. The VA is likely understaffed, but good God they are trying. I don't really sympathize with the homeless epidemic. I have what I have and I don't really feel like sharing what I've earned. America is a kick ass country. Our defense budget is huge but that's the cost to be the boss.	My views haven't changed but I do now understand why the politicians in the UK can make such horrendous decisions for our armed forces, the majority of politicians have never done the job.	0
What movie had a happy ending until you consider what had to happen next?	Dark Knight trilogy. It seems to me that if Batman actually ever retires then Robin should get the first shot at being promoted. Actually, that sets up the whole alternative universe where Robin is really pissed and decides to get revenge	At the end of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, you just know that Cameron is gunna get the shit kicked out of him by his dad.	0
How do you respond to someone who tells you "You're so quiet" or "You don't talk much"?	My sister is six feet tall. She hates when people state what is so blatantly obvious: "You're really tall." She asked me for a good comeback. I told her just to respond with a casually stated, "Oh." Not in question form. Just, "Oh." The looks on people's faces is just as awkward as the silence that follows. Seems that could be an even great response to someone being told they're quiet and/or shy.	I never understood why people so uncomfortable when their asked this question. I usually just say "I know, I'm a pretty shy person." Unless in front of like 5+ people then its just awks as fuck.	1
Ladies of Reddit, what's something a guy you were previously uninterested in has done to change your mind?	Take all of this shit to r/askwomen. I'm tired of seeing a "I'm a total loser, what's a cheat code for sex?" thread every day. Get in shape Develop a personality Dont be a coward	Just remembered another one from my other job. There is a guy in my office who is really nice, but terribly awkward. He has a very nervous laugh that he does whenever I ask him a question. He likes me because I always share my amazing lunches with him. Then we had the Christmas party, we all got a little too drunk, then decided to go swimming. This guy didn't bring swimmers, so he just got naked. The weird thing is, when he got naked his nervous laugh disappeared. The rest of the night he was talking to me normally and we found out we have a lot in common. I'm not dating him, but I totally want to bang him.	0
What "type of person" annoys you the most?	The type that acts based on emotions. The type that is willfully ignorant about scientific topics and asserts their opinion as if it is fact. The type that fuels their ignorance through cognitive biases.	Anyone that posts their good deeds on social media. To me, a good deed is something positive you do for the the benefit of someone else, with absolutely no benefit to yourself. If you're gloating about it on social media for attention it kinda takes away from the meaning of doing a good deed.	0
What movie scene hits you hard every time?	Dammit people use spoiler tags or warn us or something! Ive had like three movies ruined for me with less than a hundred comments.	The scene in Big Fish, where he drops his father into the river. Closely followed by the funeral of his father.	0
I once bought a "make your own hemp necklace" kit and tried to smoke the cord because I thought hemp = weed. Reddit, what was your most spectacular misguided failure?	I used to think I could suck milk out of my nipples with a straw when I was super young. I'm a male.	In my early stages of smoking le ganja. I chose to sprinkle sugar on top of the bowl to make it sweeter. It doesn't make it sweeter.	1
Married men and women of Reddit, how did you know that he/she was the one you were going to annoy for the rest of your life?	She said, "We should get married. I love you. I'm not going anywhere." I thought about it and couldn't think of anything negative about it.	I was 15 with an abusive family. He was 18 and a Marine. I was immediately smitten and he said I was the girl he'd always dreamed of. We just knew that we're meant to be. We married when I was 19 and we're still together 36 years later.	1
Reddit, what is your weirdest I-got-stalked story?	I was hunted once. I just came back from 'Nam. I was hitching through Oregon, and some cop started harassing me. Next thing you know, I had a whole army of cops chasing me through the woods! I had to take 'em all out. It was a bloodbath.	I was walking home from the liquor store in college and happened to glance behind me and saw (i have terrible vision) a golden retriever, plodding along after me about 100 feet away. this was in a residential neighborhood so i didn't think twice about it. after a few blocks, it was still following me so i thought maybe it was lost. I turned around and called to it - something generic like "come here fella" at which point it froze, and did that very distinctive "I'm-a-cat-and-you-can't-see-me" move; frozen still, back arched, as low to the ground as possible. It was a mountain lion. I ran like fuck inside and drank heavily to scare the beast away.	0
What is the luckiest thing that ever happened to you?	I was born with a rare form of cancer that went undiagnosed until I was 8, and in that time it never spread past my fingertip (it started under the nail).	Sophomore year of high school if I hadn't taken a different route from my second period class to my third period class I would've never met my future wife. And one time she bought be Bucs Playoff tickets and then let me fuck her in the ass when the Giants beat them because "it doesn't count as a present if the Bucs lose."	1
What's that activity that everyone loves but you don't?	I hate nature attractions, like national parks, Yellowstone, etc. They're nice for a minute or two when you look at the view and stuff, but then there's bugs everywhere, too many damn tourists anyways, and literally nothing to do but keep walking and looking at slightly different scenery. I hate camping too. Why would I willingly live like a Third Worlder refugee, for fun? (Exaggerating) But the concept of public national parks is pretty nice and I will always support their continued existence.	I fucking hate the beach. I hate the sand, I hate the gross seawater, I hate the sunlight giving me sunburn and skin cancer, I hate getting home and picking the sand out of my asshole for the next two days. Lets go to the aquarium instead. At least then we get to look at some cool shit.	0
What don't you do anymore due to a bad experience?	I don't do mushrooms anymore because I freaked a fuck out. Cops called, stole one of their cars, went on a 10 mile chase, ditched the car, ran into a mall, and was found hiding from monsters in the basement of the mall.	I can't eat at IHOP anymore. When I was 13 I was at an IHOP with my family and halfway through my meal I found a chewed up piece of gum stuck to one of the pancakes. That memory disgusts me so much that it's all I can associate with that entire chain.	0
What stupid ideas did you secretly think were original or clever before a Google search took you down a notch?	I spent a good 4 or 5 years developing an animated TV series about video game characters in their off hours (think "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" but with video game characters instead of cartoons). The main characters were a few old school characters who were having trouble fitting into modern games. As far as development stages - I had finished the voice record and had just begun animation on the first episode when I heard about a little upcoming film called "Wreck It Ralph". Granted, our concept was a lot darker and more adult oriented. And I may still pick this project up in a few years after everyone forgets about WIW. Was such a clever idea, and so many hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars went into our project, it would be a shame to just let it die.	When I was around 6 I had an idea that in the future I would become and engineer and invent a thing that used a cars movement to charge its on battery for infinite power. Then I learnt what an alternator does. Dreams=Crushed	1
What is something many people would consider a flaw about you, but you love and wouldn't change?	An ex complained recently that I am too devoted to my dog. Hey, he's been with me through all my relationships. He's older now and I do my best to be there for him. I don't consider it a flaw.	I wouldn't say I *love* it, but if I had to option to get rid of my Gender Identity Disorder then I probably wouldn't. At this point that would just end up changing who I am too much.	1
Has anyone actually FOUND a love connection on the "Missed Connection" section of Craig's List? What's your story?	One time I met a lawyer on there but it turned out he was a criminal lawyer not a criminal who's a lawyer. It was Saul it was a reference	Definitely not a love story, but I posted a missed connection about a guy who was temporarily working at my job. He replied back within hours and we went on a couple of dates. He became way too clingy way too fast and I ended up having to involve security when he began literally following me around at work on his days off. And bonus: because my friends know how much I love reading the missed connections, I've been pranked twice by them posting bogus ads directed towards me. Thanks, scott!	0
What are the worst double standards that don't involve gender or race?	I'm 21 and when I call my apartment office because they overcharge me for rent I get brushed off, but when my 56 year old dad calls suddenly the manager has all the time in the world. I find that when you're younger people in authority tend to blow you off way more.	I know this will be dumped in the -so brave- category but realistically most organised religion. "dont believe in false idols" - believes book written by mad sheep farmers re-written and re-interpreted by politicians and monks for the following two thousand years... :/	1
Parents of Reddit, what is something your kid has done that left you saying "yup...that one is mine."?	Not parents but their son. When I was playing designated pitch baseball (where a machine pitches the ball to you, about 7-10 yr olds) I was playing short stop and a line drive got hit to me. I literally just put my glove in the air and the ball went into it. I can still hear my mom when it happened. She let jumped up and let out the loudest "oooooohhhhhh!!" I knew I made her proud that day	My son used to climb as high as he could on things, then yell, "Hey dad, look!" and then jump.	0
When I was young I used to get new prescription glasses in 1 hour or they were free, now it takes 1-2 weeks - what industries are getting worse over time when it comes to customer service?	Medicine I don't believe was always out of reach for the common people until recently. Albuterol inhalers used to be cheap and insurance would cover the cost. Now even with insurance it can cost a *Very* pretty penny. My mom is disabled and the government pays for her medical costs, but will only cover certain prescriptions. An albuterol inhaler for her is still ~$150. Insulin used to be like that. It was cheaper for my mom to take a day off of work, drive for 8-10 hours in total to drive down to Mexico and buy insulin there.	Banks. When I started working on banking, we gave gifts to new customers, sent personalized cards signed by everyone at the branch to existing customers for milestones (birthday, baby, anniversary with the bank, etc) and we always had coffee, cookies, and milk for customers in our lobby. Plus we would make hot chocolate or tea or whatever they wanted while they were seated in the lobby/in a bankers office. We even had special days each week where we had subs or pizzas as a customer appreciation. It was all about the service, and we knew if we treated our customers well, more people would come do business with us. And it was so sad, seeing all of that slowly disappear. Now banks just treat people like crap. That's why I got out of banking.	0
You are instantly transported back into yourself on the first day of high school, with all your current knowledge and experiences. What do you do differently?	High school I would do the same with a bit more confidence. College on the other hand I would take a lot more seriously and make sure to never get the freshman 15 as well.	work hard, go and be a christian from day 1 ( meaning repent and get baptized...i'd read my bible everyday)...try to get as many people saved as possible... I'd try my best to meet w. teachers and get a 4.0 and sign up for more extracurricular activities so i could have a better experience. I'd be more pure...or try my best to be....and lead a God Like life.... I'd start saving whatever money i had in my job to pay off for those stupid student loans I'm still paying for....	1
What is your favourite animated TV series and why?	Venture Bros. It may take years for each season to come out, but it's some of the funniest satire I've ever seen.	My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic. When we 4channers watched the pilot as a lark, we didn't expect to become fans. The show opens with a unicorn grad student, a skeptical nerd, discovering an ancient prophecy that's about to come true, and to save the world and her mentor, she and several other brave ponies set off into a dark forest. The humor is so sincere and heartwarming, not about cringe humor, offensiveness, or pop culture references, and it helped me move past my depression; and the philosophical underpinnings started curing my symptoms of autism and codependency. I wouldn't be as happy, healthy, or creative today if I hadn't started watching it. If I had to compare it to anything in terms of worldbuilding and the drama/comedy mix, it would be Disney Afternoon's Tale Spin.	1
What's the most pain you've ever experienced?	When I had to say goodbye to my ex as she was moving overseas. That hurt so god damn much. Also getting a cactus stuck in my arm one time.	I had hot oil poured into a boot and got my left foot deep fried. The skin on my foot is still all weird and rubbery. (It was a freak accident cleaning out the deep fryer at a restaurant.)	0
Band groupies that had sex with their idols, how did it affect the way you saw them afterwards?	Not exactly what you asked for but... A friend of a friend slept with Calvin Harris and later got a dick pic. Dude is huge.	While I don't approve of many of the choices he made while we spent time together, I do still enjoy the musical stylings of Michael Jackson. Edit: Downvotes? I see we have some Prince fans in the thread.	1
What are you fed up of people telling you?	We're killing the world. So? What's your point? Let's drop everything and become hunter gatherers. No? Didn't think so. Move along hippy.	Growing up as the only black person in my white town, I was told all the time that I was adopted because my mom and stepdad were white. Apparently none of the rednecks were smart enough to realize there's probably another piece to the puzzle...	0
I'm a carpentry apprentice and today I fitted a whole kitchen on my own for the first time. What's something that you're extremely proud of that might mean very little to anybody else?	I'm a dog walker, and one of my clients is a little terrier who was abused for the first 5 years of his life. He now has a lovely home, but is still very mistrusting of both humans and other dogs. He has to wear a muzzle when we go walking and he hates it. We've been walking together for about 2 months now, and when we first started walking he would always growl any time I touched him, or even looked at him really. He's slowly stopped growling at me, and just the other day he licked me on the face! It was so exciting, I started crying! It probably doesn't mean much to other people, but to me, and him, it's a massive step!	My grandfather was a rice farmer. My father was the first person in his family with a college degree (I am the second) and moved to the US following the American dream. When he came here, his degree wasn't recognized, so he had to start over. He worked 2 jobs to support our family and put me through school. I am now a 2nd year medical student. Fuck yeah America is the land of opportunity.	1
What's your favorite inside joke on Reddit?	No reddit inside joke is funny (and the ones that are are brought up far too often they become stale - see 'broken arms') and I cringe so hard whenever I see people referencing them in real life.	on /r/legaladvice if you don't put your location when it really matters, then they just assume that you are referring to a random country in Africa. Often it's a country that doesn't exist any more.	0
Those who are in support of illegal/undocumented immigrants staying, why?	The country will descend into absolute chaos if he tries removes 10 million illegals. They are responsible for all the jobs that many Americans refuse to do	I wouldn't really say I actively support it, per se. But I'm highly sympathetic. There's bigger issues plaguing our country than some guy from Latin America working under minimum wage in a job most Americans would laugh at if offered the job even at minimum wage let alone below it. So I wouldn't waste my time being a dick calling ICE or whatever if I saw some family confessing to me they're not legal. As long as they're not breaking the important laws of humanity like not stealing, raping or murdering, I don't mind them being here one bit.	0
Reddit, what animal do you find creepy that everybody else thinks is adorable?	Ladybugs. They have invaded my room, made love and I have never been able to kill them all. They smell disgusting when killed, but they keep coming, for over 3 years already. Can't find where they keep coming from.	Cats. Not so much the animal itself but me and my friends have to date never met someone that has a cat that is normal. There is always something strange/off about cat people.	1
What didn't you realize about yourself until someone told you ?	Whenever I walk around alone, even if I'm in a perfectly good mood, I look like I'm going to somewhere I know I am going to die. I apparently have a constant look of pure dread whenever I walk around alone.	That, because I'm white, I have had an easy ride through life. That everything was giving to me, that I've never had to struggle, and that people trip over themselves to make sure my life is nice and cozy. I also make way more money than anyone else strictly because I'm white and have a penis. And because of all this, my opinion doesn't matter. I need to just sit down and shut up. I need to accept what others say as fact and can't question it, unless its a white male saying something I'm supposed to disagree with. Also, because of my gender and skin color I only have two options: be an ally or be a Nazi.	1
What is a current “don’t ask/don’t tell” situation with your family?	My grandmother who has terminal cancer. She was given a few months to live around 3 years ago. It's just been stagnant since, and we just kind of don't talk about it. She just says "I'll let the cancer know when I'm ready" when someone brings it up. &#x200B; Italian grandmothers are a different breed.	Trump! I have several family members who, for whatever reason, really thought Trump was going fix everything. Now they're embarrassed by him and refuse to talk about politics. I noticed my uncle removed the Trump/Pence bumper sticker from his car, lol. Even the facebook memes have dried up. But, we're western Kansas methodists who have been taught from birth that emotion and confrontation are ungodly and politeness must be maintained at all costs, so we all just pretend it never happened at talk about the weather instead. It's George Bush all over again!	1
Aside from the wheel, what other simple inventions are taken for granted?	Everyday food products. Like whoever discovered milk has explaining to do of why they were grabbing a cow down there.	Glass, it's crazy how different things would be if we weren't able to see through things... No windows, no glasses, so many things made use of glass in early days	0
What is something that you were told "you'll understand when your older" that you totally understood when you were older?	How time flies. I always remember adult members of the family at gatherings commenting on how time had flown. How quickly the Summer went, etc. I just never understood it. They would always say "you'll see when you get older." God damn... turned out to be true.	Honestly, there's nothing in this category I couldn't have understood as a kid. I think it was more just adults either not wanting to go into an explanation, or not being any good at explaining/teaching. (Honestly pretty irritating, really. All the things I could have learned at a younger age.)	1
[SERIOUS] Reditors who married their first boyfriend/girlfriend, how is it working out? Do you regret it?	regret it? every day. Fucker got everything because he claimed I beat him and was abusive. that was one time and he smashed the windshield to my truck.	We ended up getting divorced a few years later. We both had a lot of growing up to do, and are each much happier in our current relationships. I don't regret it; removing such a major part of my past would change the course of my life -- I'd lose those lessons learned -- and I like how things have turned out since.	0
Reddit: I think a coworker of mine may have done something awful. What can I do to help?	I'd go to police if she's a no-show again. The no calling in and her being in no communication with anyone is very disconcerting to me if she's as responsible as you say. Send an update. I made the mistake of reading this just before going to bed.	ya, she's dead. check her office for any stuff better than yours. staplers, notebooks, chairs, etc. All fair game now.	1
You've won the Powerball jackpot, but it takes 30 days to get you the money. How do you spend those 30 days?	Probably just keep going to school and playing video games. I don't really think that winning the lottery would change my life much at this point in time.	Ask people for favors. See who would actually help me and pay attention to me when I'm not filthy rich	0
What's your least favorite book? And why?	Fahrenheit 451. It's the most boring thing I've ever read. Also, A Handmaid's Tale. It takes forever to actually start caring about what happens to the characters, and then the ending hits ten pages later.	Whirligig /r/im14andthisisdeep/: the novel. About an angst young boy who tried killed himself via car crash. He survived, but killed a girl in a reckless car crash. The girl's mother dropped the charges if he can place whirligigs on the four corners on the US. He follows pretentious journey of philosophy, religion, and meaning of life. Don't bother...	0
Liberals, what is your most conservative viewpoint? Conservatives, what is your most liberal viewpoint?	Liberal here that sports Bernie gear and professes to love all people..... I can't stand queers, or anyone who decides to make their sexual fetish the focal point of their existence. Can't wait until this fad runs it's course.	Liberal: I feel we need to de-emphasize college and re-emphasize skilled trades. edit: Reddit isn't representative of your average liberal as a whole. In general, liberalism tends to advocate higher education for everyone.	0
What is the craziest thing, NSFW or otherwise, you've seen going on inside another car as you're driving on the interstate or other road?	Driving along the highway one summer I passed a limo that was playing a porno on the tv inside. That was pretty dope.	Saw a young kid in the back seat of a car doing a handstand while violently kicking the ceiling with his legs. He was like a chimpanzee... Just pumping away at the car ceiling with what looked like all his might. In the front passenger seat was what looked like a teenage girl on her phone pretty much glued to her face and driving was the mother... with nothing but a blank look on her face. Just staring off in the distance, as if her soul was lost years ago.	0
What food is delicious but a pain to eat?	I'd say pretty much any shellfish and tons of seafood would fall into this category. Crab, lobster, oysters, crayfish are all messy, hard and potentially dangerous to eat if you don't know what you're doing. Sucks they had to be so darn tasty.	Steak USED to be one of my favorite treats before I realized that cows are castrated and branded without anesthetic, transported for hours in hot conditions with no water, prodded and whipped, and often are still alive when they're chained up by one ankle to be stripped of their skin. That all sounds very painful.	1
Men of Reddit, when was the last time you cried and what were your reasons behind the tears?	My brother went back to prison a few months ago after violating parole. And when he called me, he said, "I'm sorry I let you down". I was doing alright until someone asked me what was wrong and then the tears just started.	Shoved a cactus up my dick. The reason for the tears was mostly the cactus that was in my dick.	1
What's the most annoying thing a thief can steal from you?	My house keys. Fuck, now I can't get into my house. start my car, start my bike. And worse, they could get in/use them as often as they want until ALL locks are changed. Ever change an ignition barrel on a car? Shits a lot of money!!	This is likely going to be buried and isn't exactly a "thing". But - your sense of security in your own home. I can replace electronics, cash, jewelry, etc., but once my personal space has been violated, it is so hard to get that "safe" feeling back.	1
If you could buy admission to an event where you could watch the detonation of a nuclear bomb from a safe distance and with proper protection, would you?	There is no safe distance, as the fallout can carry for hundreds or thousands of miles. Witness radiation from Fukushima being detected as far away as central Canada, and that wasn't even a bomb, just a reactor meltdown.	Nah. I don't think the real thing would live up to Colbert's impression of a nuclear bomb. Just not awesome enough.	0
Former homeless people, what would have been a nice inexpensive thing for a stranger to give you?	Not homeless myself, but have worked with a lot of homeless, outreach etc. The answer to this question is SOCKS. A clean, dry pair of socks to change into will really be appreciated.	A pint of alcohol or a blunt. Maybe a pack of cigs. I knew how to get food and clothing in my city plus occasional shelter, but those luxuries were less common and really help in having fun. That or just cash. People know what they need most and homeless people can stretch more out of money than most Edit Fuck downvotes. I spent a chunk of my life on sidewalks and parks. Please believe me	1
What is the most unbelievable coincidence you ever experienced?	We gave my uncle a coffee table book commemorating an NFL team for his birthday. He immediately opened it to the center spread, a panoramic shot of the fans in the stadium. Unbeknownst to any of us beforehand, right in the center of the page was him in the stands.	I went to buy a new car yesterday and I was trading in my old car. My old car had started fine for the last three years since the battery was replaced and it started fine when I left my house. When the trade in guy got into it to take to the service bay to check it out it would start, dead battery.	1
Its 2:09 AM. You cant sleep so you turn on your TV. What's the scariest thing that could be shown?	Don't turn on the TV when you're having trouble sleeping, have a cold drink of water and keep the lights dim. Read from an actual book for 10 minutes then try again. Don't look at light sources, this includes all screens. The scariest thing that could be shown is Nicky Minaj singing about her puddle ass.	A live feed of me watching my TV. Or a live feed of my bedroom. Or just a live feed of any room of my house. *shudders* EDIT: it appears that I have made a mistake in that I now have to go to bed after reading all of your comments. Thanks! I'm going to cover up my TV now and not fap to anything.	0
Last night I was out on a date and everything was going great.... and then her ex turned up... crying, drunk and crazy... What is the worst thing that has happened to you on a first date?	Think about it from her perspective: She's on a first date with an old friend from school, things are going great you're really hitting it off and you guys even joined a paper airplane throwing contest (how quirky and original is that!). The whole time though, that asshole Mike is texting you and calling non-stop. Eventually he shows up and completely ruins your evening and any chance you had of dating this guy who probably thinks you're some crazy emotional loser... That would suck, right? Call or text her saying something like "Sorry last night ended so weird, still excited to see Batman today?" or something like that.	A broken man is every man's friend. We have all been this blubbering man, if not recently then in our teen years.... Don't add insult to his injury if you don't have to.... but if he becomes violent then you take action. Mens before Hens	1
Pet owners, what is the "evolution" of your pet's name into its nicknames?	Not my pet but how my family calls my newborn baby > babby > babbybloo > babbybalong > babybleybs > baleybs	One of our dogs is called Toby. Toby is not a very bright dog, because of this we randomly just started calling him "Dave" or "David" and he would respond to it. We all alternate as to which we call him.	0
What's a cool skill you have that can be mastered in less than a month?	I have braces. I quickly leant how to make high frequency whistles with my braces. Pisses people off in exams and sometimes I get the attention of bitches (female dogs... Geddit?)	I can throw cards across the room into a hat like a magician. If you have a good reading source and three hours you can master it.	0
People who work in hotels, what are some the scariest, unexplainable, and/or creepiest things that you have experienced while working?	This dude came up to me and asked for jumper wires. Thinking that his car battery has died, I got him some. He then proceeded to beat the shit out of his son for not using a serious tag.	Got into a lift from the top floor to head down. Lift stopped at 4th floor, door opened, saw people outside standing still, making no attempt to come in despite me being alone inside and there was room for them. The automatic lift door then closed and before it was completely shut, I heard someone outside said "Why is the lift so full of people?". FML	0
What is your golden rule for social situations?	When someone is talking to you and you want to know more or just keep the conversation going, simply repeat back the last phrase as a question. It makes you look engaged and interested. Ex: "I just got back from vacation to the Poconos." "The Poconos?" "Yeah! It's a mountain range in Pennsylvania, and known for being really gorgeous. We decided to go there because..."	Always, always, ALWAYS, I cannot stress this enough... Think about the greatest joke of all time in your head and prepare for the best moment to tell it before the conversation switches topics, then precede to mess up every single word of said joke and slowly fade into mumbles, next run as far away from these people as you can. Now that you are a safe distance, these people are no longer your friends and your name is no longer [insert name]. Repeat.	1
I eat my leftovers cold and never thought it was weird until my wife said so. What is a 'normal' habit you do that you had no idea was abnormal or unique?	I only use one pen until it is out of ink. I never thought this was weird behavior then people in my office started to notice and made a big deal about it. *How's your special pen today t_hro_w?* Fuck you.	When we have spaghetti for dinner, I don't like noodles. Instead, I like to crush up Frito's into the sauce. Yum.	1
[Serious] Soldiers of Reddit who've fought in Afghanistan, what preconceptions did you have that turned out to be completely wrong?	Was in the Tangi Valley and we had two of our 4 of hmmwvs broke in the middle of a town. The whole village male population came out to help us dig out our vehicles. Talking like 100-200 people who were digging and shit. Right next to us and with us. Sun went down and it started to snow. Everyone left. We got attacked that night. The villagers didn't want us there. Not because they hated us, but because they knew their mud huts were about to get fucked up in the attack that would happen that night. Christmas Eve, i think 2010?	I want to thank everyone in this thread for refreshing my vitriolic hatred of this occupation and everyone that supported it.	1
Reddit, how did you get your scars?	You wanna know how I got these scars? My father...was...a drinker, and a fiend. And one night, he goes off craaazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that. Not...one...BIT. So...me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me...and he says..."WHY SO SERIOUS?". He comes at me with the knife..."WHY SO SERIOUS?!". Sticks the blade in my mouth..."LET'S PUT A SMILE ON THAT FACE!"...aaaand...why so serious?	So I have a foot long scar across my chest, and I'm a guy so anytime I'm at the beach people ask. I've told everyone various cool stories, but the truth is that when I was 10 my friend bribed me with a dollar to ride my bicycle into a mailbox.	0
What villain kinda had a point from any movie, game, etc?	Bane, hands down, Batman is a trust-fund, silver spoon baby, defending the status quo and the one percent. Bane represents the poor, the underdog, born in a prison, he molded himself into someone stronger than batman.	I can't remember the character's name, but in the Alien Isolation game, I was forced to stop a guy on the infested ship from kidnapping my team mate and blowing everyone up. He reasoning was that there was no other way because any survivors would just keep perpetuating the cycle of doom we were in. I really wanted to let him do it cause he was right.	0
What is your go-to "deep discussion" question to really pick someone's brain about?	An alien ship comes down beams you up and(assume they are benevolent) say, "come explore the universe with us. We will show you thousands of worlds and countless new forms of life and technology but you can never return to earth. Nor can you call/write/text/carrier pigeon anyone before or after you leave." Do you go?	This one just occurred to me due to a recent experience. Do you think that, as a human, we can visit other species' afterlifes? Reason being, we recently had our cats run away. One is currently just MIA. The other is MPD. Three nights ago, I had a dream that I was in a hotel like room and all the cats that my family have had, and I know have passed on were there. Then, the two that ran away, showed up in the dream. I don't know what that means but, I think they're both dead.	1
Current and former fast food employees, what's one thing on your menu that you would never, ever eat and why?	Wendy's chili. We toss all the old burned burgers in a huge pan and "save" them for chili meat. And you'd wash the piles of burned meat 1st . Gross	Domino's lava cakes.... Because I've SEEN lava cake addiction first hand and no way do I need to go through that withdrawal. Incidentally I feel like a crack dealer when I give customer "free" lava cakes as a customer appreciation thing because I know they will always order it next time...and next time, ad infinitum. And yes this does work.	0
Bilingual people of Reddit, what language do your thoughts occur in?	I think in English, even though it's my second language. But for some reason my brain always reads/thinks about numbers in my first language (Thai). It only happens for numbers though, no idea why.	My thoughts are mostly in english, I don't know why but it's probably because I read pretty much 100% english anyway since I'm on the internet a lot, I've actually gotten rid of the terrible accent that most people in my country have even though I've barely spoken english in real life	1
What excuse from someone was total BS the first time you heard it but turned out to be true ?	All four of his grand parents had died and were being put into the ground all within two weeks of each other.And he was pallbearer at each one of them--so he had to miss our midterm and another test after. Yup, they did all die.	"Dude! I can't come give you the money back yet, I totally have it but my Nana fell into a wasp nest and I gotta go to hospital!!!" "Yknow what, Chad? Every time you do this I hate you a little bit more! What kind of loser makes an excuse up like this?! Asshole!" A week later I got an invite to his grandmother's funeral. My face O_O; He gave me my money back and asked me to leave at the wake :( I stole a whole tray of cheese biscuits.	1
What's your "crazy ex" story?	A friend of mine had a pretty crazy ex. They once lived together and had a pet cat, but started getting into arguments and broke up. While moving out, I believe they were arguing on who to keep the cat even though my friend was the one who bought it. After parting ways, the girl emailed him saying she is suing because she was claiming the cat was hers. My friend had to get a lawyer and everything. She eventually backed out of the whole thing, but damn was she crazy.	I dated a girl with Borderline Personality Disorder for a year. • Alcoholic • Self Harming • Cheater • Emotionally Abusive • Manipulative • Mood Swings I don't keep people with BPD in my life anymore.	1
My bus driver intentionally skipped my stop because a man in a wheelchair was waiting there and he didn't want to let him on. What instances of terrible/immoral customer service have you witnessed?	I was charged twice at a restaurant last month, and after a few times calling and leaving my name and information, my dad went in for me (I didn't have time to go with). Anyway, they said, "Well, why should we believe you?" *My bank statement is right there..* EDIT: We did end up getting the money back.	Once, they were some stupid football game going on (1998 world cup, we won) and the bus driver wanted to go home. I still had to make it to my hostel in a city I didn't know. He didn't seem to understand he has to finish is circuit, but make it anyway. Not the same as your story, but it's my experience of a bus driver trying not to make the stop.	1
Why did alcohol prohibition require a constitutional amendment but marijuana prohibition didn't?	The Switch in Time. Prohibition was passed at a time when Commerce Clause doctrine was very narrow, and so limited the powers of Congress. The Switch in Time blew the Commerce Clause wide open and many, many Acts of Congress became constitutional.	Easy, liberals succeeded in using the commerce clause to give the federal government nearly unlimited power and now they don't like the effects. I'll never understand why the Left wants the type of SCOTUS that continues this erosion of Constitutional rights...	1
Non-Americans who have served with US soldiers, what is your opinion of them?	Ex Royal Air Force aircrew. Always had a good time with the Americans I served with. A lot used to get confused by me being Scottish in the "English" Air Force but on one detachment I met an American with the same clan surname as me and we ended up "bezzering", that's what Brits call it when you are so drunk you and a mate are propping each other up while loudly trying to shout over each other that "No, YOU'RE my best mate". Bloke ended up inviting me to his house a few nights later for a BBQ and then introduced me to everyone as a "long lost relative". Barmy but brilliant.	my ex served with quite a few, and all he said were they were arrogant with a god complex and lacked the skills to back it up.	1
As a kid, what was your worst "my parents are going to kill me" moment?	I had a lot of weed in my room and I was only 15 years old. My dad got pissed of. I dont want to see this again in this house. It was not easy to get face to face with him again. At the end now im 21 we smoked weed together.	At 15 I had a party while my parents were out of town. I cleaned the house so meticulously, they would never know. Mom goes into the fridge and instantly finds a 12 pack of beer. Of all things, the only place I didn't think to check was the fridge. I thought for sure I would never see the light of day again. I was grounded for 2 months.	0
I know this has probably been brought up a thousand times, but my wife of 5 years, mother of my two kids, and love of my fucking life has cheated on me. What do I do?	I have been where you are now. I worked hard to trust her again only to have her cheat again. My soon to be ex did the same thing, crying and apologizing and promising it would never happen again. Maybe I am a bad example but in my opinion once a spouse has cheated it will happen again. It's.just a.matter.of when and with who. This will cause years of stress and fighting. Everyone in the family will feel the pain. If you leave now it will be better for everyone in the long run Good luck	Kick that bitch to the curb, DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES LEAVE THE MARITAL HOME. have the lock changed when she goes to work.	1
Redditors with prosthetics, do you take them off before having sex or no? Why?	No, because I need it to have sex in the first place. ... I’m trans, and I have to use a prosthetic dick because a permanent one costs more than a house.	My buddy who lost his right hand in a farming accident says that he has had a crazy number of “Nubbin’ Lovin’” requests from past paramours. No explanation necessary I hope.	0
What unconventional ways did your parents use to punish you as a kid?	My foster parents always left the threat that if I seriously got in trouble at school (high school), my foster father would go with me and sit with me in class, and basically be my shadow.	Whenever I did something "wrong", my dad would usually threaten or use violence to teach me a "lesson". Being bad in my dad's house was usually something like talking back when he wanted you to read the Quran or something else really trivial. His favorite was taking my arm and twisting it behind my back and demanding an apology. If you refused he would twist harder. I never said sorry, because I knew I hadn't done anything wrong. On the bright side, this gave me an amazing pain tolerance, which comes in handy. He would also use memorizing the Quran as a punishment. Pretty shitty father. I don't speak to him anymore.	1
Women of Reddit, what type of male behavior dries you up like the Sahara?	Trying to be suggestive or overly sexual way too soon. Trying to ask me what I like sexually when I've known you for 45 minutes or assuming I'd like all the things you're explicitly stating that you'd do when it's our second or third time meeting creates so much second hand embarrassment it makes me want to vomit.	Treating me different than a man and observing *really* old ideas of etiquette like walking on the street side of the side walk, or running ahead to open the door.	1
What job do you think is underpaid / overpaid and why?	OVERPAID: Waiters in California. They get paid minimum wage plus 15-20% tips. This could avg out to more than $30-$50 an hour. Bartenders as well.	Paramedics in the US. Such an enormously stressful and difficult job, but they get paid such crap to do it.	0
People who finish the whole tube of lip balm, how are you so on top of your lives?	Three tubes at once. 1. By the bed side. 2. In my purse. 3. In the bathroom. They stay where they stay and never get lost- which seems to be how people lose them and don't finish them. If you know where they are you'll finish them.	I finish about 1 chapstick a week. People check their pockets for phone/wallet. I'd rather be without those and have a chapstick	1
What is something someone said that forever changed your way of thinking?	The D.H. Lawrence quote "I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself." It really made think and realize it is true, watch any PBS wildlife show and inevitable some of the herd ends up dying, and none of them are ever sad or crying for their lots in life. Pity/self-pity are entirely human. My beloved cat passed away 2 years ago, and by the time I knew he was sick, his heart was enlarged, he had some type of cancer, and could no longer produce red blood cells. And the whole time he must have been sick, I couldn't even tell. He was strong and brave, and I learned a lesson that self-pity is a solely human feeling and one I never wanted to indulge in again.	"Don't ever make fun of some who speaks broken English, it means they speak another language." Wow, I feel like crap now.....	0
Has anyone ever been to/in a wedding where someone objected? If so, what happened?	An acquaintance of mine got married in a public park. Right around the time the preacher said "You may kiss the bride," a guy driving down the adjacent street leaned out his car window and shouted "DON'T DO IT, MAN!" The newlyweds were a little upset, but it was one of the more memorable weddings I've attended.	If by objected you mean abducted the bride when she was plastered at the bachelorette party the night before, then yes. And what happened was that it was the best next six months of my life.	1
If you could "click unsubscribe" from anything in life, what would it be and why?	Gaining weight. I want to be able to eat whatever I want, whenever I want and never gain a pound or change my physique.	The shower thoughts subreddit. My life would be improved drastically if I weren't subjected to people's shitty attempts at wit and half assed observational comedy.	1
What was the best day of your life?	Me and some guys from school had a band. That summer i worked at the theatre evenings and during the days we would practice a lot. Eventually Jody got engaged and then married, and my friend Jimmy just up and quit one day. I sometimes find myself looking back on those days, that summer seemed to last forever. Definitely the best days of my life.	New Years day this year. I was almost a year sober, and while I watched the fireworks I thought "I did it!" I'd been trying to get sober for almost a decade before I finally got the time I have now, and I had always just kind of assumed I would fuck up over the holidays. But as I watched(from my own apartment but that's another post entirely), it just kinda popped into my head that I'd done it. And it made the whole night for me. I'm smiling now remembering it. :)	0
People who discovered their partner was living a double life or keeping a significant magnitude secret, in retrospect what signs did you perhaps miss or what events now make more sense?	The fact that these insane arguments would spark from nothing and he would end up stripping naked randomly and/or punching things. Drugs. I was that oblivious.	This is about my brother-in-law. He had cancer and kept bringing home ridiculous amount of money. He was a high school chemistry teacher. Also, he was really close to this kid he taught, Jesse. His family told me that he had devised an incredible BlackJack strategy somehow mathematically beat the house and hence the $$$$. Turns out he was running the largest meth operation in America and... I'm now dead.	1
What's the furthest you've ever gone with something you didn't want to do, just to be polite and/or avoid awkwardness?	Legend has it that Michael Cera isn't actually an actor, he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time when someone asked him to try out for a role, and he's in too deep now to back out.	I met my boyfriend's family. Not a big people person here. I just wanted to go home, have a beer, and watch a movie.	1
What is the craziest thing a coworker of yours has done and kept their job?	My supervisor at a gas station sold cigarettes to a 17 year old in a sting, was given a written arrest on the spot, got to keep his job and was later promoted to manager. A few months later I sold beer to a 27 year old in a company sting to see if I ID'd people who looked 35 or younger and I was fired. Fuck you, BP. Edit: Holy shit, thought for sure this would get buried like every other comment I've ever submitted to AskReddit. I guess I got a good story out that experience.	this one asshole just goes on reddit for like the entire fucking workday. get off reddit John, I swear to god	1
What issue did you turn 180 on and why?	I was Liberal until it became really trendy to openly hate straight white men, the police and military service members. My SO recently sent me a screen-shot of one of her good trans friends saying how "Cis people are disgusting and shouldn't be allowed around kids." It really pissed her off and shes starting to make the same 180 I did. Realized liberalism is full of hypocrites. Mostly around the SJW trans community we once supported. I cant treat people with respect and kindness, when they openly are bigoted about me and my SO for being straight and white.	Nuclear power. I was against it for all the usual reason (toxic waste, the danger of meltdowns etc.). That was until I talked to people who knew much more about the subject than I did.	0
Which terrible actor has had the most successful movie career?	Ben Affleck. He doesn't even try. He's like an awkward boy going through puberty in a high school play he didn't want to be in.	While not exactly successful anymore, I would say that the the fact Steven Seagal had a movie career at all is a kind of success.	0
There is a German term called schadenfreude, which roughly translates to "happiness at the misfortune of others". What's your best example of schadenfrude you've witnessed?	In the U.S. - people seem to be obsessed with their political side "winning" and take delight when something happens, even if it's detrimental to our country as a whole.	Have you ever heard of the Avenue Q song Schadenfreude? Has many great examples. In fact, whenever it's raining, the song starts playing in my head: "Don'tcha feel all warm and cozy, watching people out in the raaaaAAAaain, thats... SCHADENFREUDE! People taking pleasure in your pain!"	1
Bosses/managers of Reddit: what's the stupidest excuse for calling in to work you've ever heard?	Really, if your employer doesn't offer paid sick time, you don't fucking owe them an excuse. You're not coming in because you're not coming in, end of story.	I have heard a lot of stupid excuses, but I had one girl who worked for me that kept calling in with "food poisoning". One day, her mother calls in for her and says that she had been sexually assaulted the night before, and would be out for a while. Since I didnt think something like this could be a lie, I told her to take all the time she needs, blah blah. Later, I called her home and asked if there was anything we could do to help her and that she had our support. Her mother didnt know what I was talking about. Turns out she had a friend call and say she was her mother, and was lying about being raped.	0
Reddit, what's a time you were really, really proud of your mom?	When I realized how she screwed the rest of the family out of thousands of dollars. Oh wait. You said proud? Then, never.	It was 1995. My mom had no interest in the show, but took me to see the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers movie when I was 10 years old. I was fucking obsessed with it, like most kids my age. A few days later, one of my childrens' magazines featured the White Ranger on the cover, and she was able to point out "That was after he got his new powers, because it has the Falcon emblem on his chest."	0
What is the worst date you have been on?	Girl picked me up had a nice date ending with lunch at her place, overall very pleasant until she found out I'd never seen the Harry Potter series of films and she refused to drive me home until I had watched them....all of them with her added personal commentary.	I went on a date with a girl that reposted this same question on reddit sixty fucking times a week.	1
I hated exams that involved simply memorizing facts or definitions. Reddit, what did you dislike about school, and how would you change it?	I remember hating those people who never paid attention and were always asking questions that the Prof just answered 5 fucking minutes ago.	Homework should not have been graded so fucking heavily. I never did homework, but still passed every test with nothing less than a B. I failed every class with an F.	1
I was a threesome baby. What things have your parents told you that you wish they hadn't?	Not me, and the parents didn't really need to tell them this but I knew of a set of twins where one was white and the other black. Yes, the woman cheated on her husband with a black man, and slept with both in such a small window that both got her pregnant.	I sat down with my dad to watch 40-Year-Old Virgin. We both enjoy gross humor, so I figured it would be a good time. Fifteen minutes into the movie, Seth Rogan talks about going down to Mexico to see a donkey show. My dad starts cracking up and proceeds to tell me about The Blue Fox, where he went with some Navy buddies back in the day while on shore leave. They watched a women fuck a donkey that night. My dad told me his friend was totally shit-faced and stumbled his way up to the stage, where he laid down. The woman came over to him when the donkey was finished and sat on this friend's face. The phrase "glazed donut" was used shortly thereafter, followed immediately by me being done with movie night. Edit: silly spelling mistake	0
What was a common problem/inconvenience you had to deal with 20 years ago that people have forgotten today?	Agreeing to meet someone over the (landline) phone, then just going out and hoping they showed up at the right time.	I am a certified athletic trainer. The fact that I can pull up an up to date radar and lightning strikes within my area has been a helpful addition to my profession. Before I had that, it was way more guesswork then anything else.	1
What life lesson have you learned from videogames?	No matter how good you are in single player, you’ll look much, much worse when you compare yourself to other players online. Every fighting game ever.	The importance of time well spent. You should play games at most for a few hours a week. Anymore and there is serious opportunity costs of time that could be spent doing more rewarding things.	1
Honduras is currently in the midst of civil unrest. What else is going on in the world that more people should know about?	El Salvador’s most recently elected president is the most progressive they’ve had in decades, he’s taken to his twitter to publicly fire known corrupt officials from office and has gained massive popularity through Central America. ‘Nayib Bukele’ is his name if you wanna search.	The US is in disarray economically. People don’t realize that what a president does isn’t present and observable clearly until 2-3 years down the line. Usually after they’ve left office.	1
What is something you constantly hear people complain about on reddit but have never personally witnessed?	Moms assuming all men are pedophiles and getting hostile if you smile and say "Hi" back to their kid in the checkout aisle. Oh, and before you guys start all the "Step 1: Be attractive" crap, I'll fully disclose that I am ugly as fuck.	The male sexual harassment that /r/twoxchromosomes talks about a lot. Edit: No, I meant sexual harassment OF men BY females. My bad, I think everyone misinterpreted what I said.	1
[Serious] Job applicants who walked out of an interview before it was over, why did you do it?	Them: "We have a very dedicated team, we often stay after normal office hours, is that ok with you?" Me: "Sure, I mean I'm single without kids, so if it's adequately compensated I'm happy to do as much overtime as necessary, no problem." Them: "Oh no no, we're passionate about the work we do here, so overtime is not paid." Me: "Okay then, thank you for your time and goodbye."	I'm Transfemale and there is only so many times that a person can call me Sir, and be corrected on it, until I realize that they are taking the piss!!	1
What's your worst "I don't get paid enough to deal with this" moment at work?	Camp counselor. Day one. Small boy, 4-6 years old, comes up and says that his "area" itches. I was 18. I figured it was his swim trunks and the netting so I told him to switch into regular clothes. That was not the case. Apparently he had some penis ointment he had to spread over his crotch every morning and that morning his mom forgot.	Late to the party, but this is so bad it's worth it. My office has an espresso machine - an industrial one like you might see at Starbucks. Well one week there was a problem with the coils, or maybe the thermometer, and it heated the espresso about 10 degrees too hot. This isn't enough to hurt you but it does make the espresso taste slightly different - hard to describe, but if you have a sensitive palate it won't taste as good. So here we were, stuck drinking very slightly off-tasting espresso for a couple days before it got fixed. Fricken hardship, man! TL;DR My work leaves me with nothing to complain about and some random redditors want the 30 seconds they spent reading this back.	1
Redditors who haven't yet pooped in 2018, what's your story?	WE’RE ON DAY FIVE! HOW HAS ANYONE NOT POOPED? I mean barring a medical reason. But five days! I’m fairly positive I pooped within the first 10 minutes of the new year. Also - somewhere on earth, someone was the first human to take a shit in 2018.	I JUST REALIZED...I have no recollection of my last poop. Maybe New Year's Eve? Maybe New Year's Day? I don't know...is this real life??	0
What's something you never understood until you experienced it first hand?	White Privilege. I always understood that it systematically made it easier for me to get through life, and therefore thought I understood it. But those are things you never really see. Since they can't actually manifest in front of you its easy to say they don't exist, or just take them fore granted like I had been. Then when I actually experienced white privilege and saw it in front of me was when I understood how much it exists in my life. Which was a lot more then I had previously thought.	Why people whine about being constipated, I mean, so what? Right? Wrong. It's a terrible, horrible thing to have to endure. The bloating, pressure and cramping force you into fondly reminiscing about your last glorious pooping session. It got to the point that I didn't even want to eat anymore for fear the traffic jam would breach borders I didn't want breached.	0
What is the cruelest thing someone has told you?	My mom's uncle told me that my dad's death was the best thing that could've happened to our family. I was sixteen and my dad was the best person in the world.	Well, my ex just ended a 2 year relationship a week ago. I've been having depression/anxiety issues since I graduated college (she moved up home with me) and was trying to cope, and it got a lot harder when I quit smoking pot to dull the issue. I gained some more weight, I had already been a big guy and have struggled with binge eating issues since I was in middle school, and had also been struggling to find a career position as quickly as she seemed to think it should take. She told me she didn't find me attractive anymore, and that my weight issue was a huge part of it. So that hurt. But, I started working out more before she ended things and i'm already down 15lbs! So fuck you, i'm gonna get ripped again and get more tattoos like I wanted to.	1
if You have the ability to teleport anywhere on the world but can't take anything/anyone with you except what fits in your pocket. Where do you go?	I wouldn't try to steal a lot because it would be noticeable. Just whenever I wanted something, a new hard drive, a CPU, a GPU, you know that type of stuff. Some cash, can easily fit 10k in your pockets.	Become a lunatic who befriends random people and when we're finally close I'll convince them to put their hand in my pocket and BAM! I teleport to Switzerland with another hand for my collection	0
What popular-on-reddit thing do you not like?	Jumping on any post by some poor asshole who forgot a serious tag and spamming it with a bunch of stupid outrageous stories and then admonishing OP for not including a serious tag.	Pretty much all things that come from tumblr. Alpha-Beta, All this SJW shit. I'm here for foodporn, porn, funny stories, news, highlights of 4chan, video game forums, and dank memes. I don't care about *you*, I don't care about what -kin you are, I don't care about your SJW acts, what race you are, if you're a girl/boy, I don't care about your political opinions, your religion, or what you think is right or wrong. So next time you go on a tangent about something remember this. Nobody cares about you, we want memes. I JUST WANT DANK MEMES	1
My former boss still owes me over 1k wages months after I quit, but he is screening my calls/messages. What can I do?	Spend $60 (Illinois price, not sure on VA) and file a suit in Small Claims court. Take any emails/phone records you have and tell your side of the story. If any other people were aware of the arrangement, have them testify and get a judgement against him. If he doesn't show, you might win by default and no lawyers are typically allowed in small claims (depending on state). Might be a low cost way to get a judgement, at least, and then you can go after assets and start charging fees and interest :) In all seriousness, might be worth a few minutes on the web to look into as an option.	There is nothing you can do. You fucked yourself by working for someone working outside US laws. Hate to say it, but this is as far as this post should and will go.	1
What "cheat codes" do you use in your personal life?	Okay so if you go somewhere and see a car that has a fine for false parking just take it off and put it on your car... they will not give anyone a second fine so your ass is safe hehe	When I don't feel like working, I'll "take a phone call" and sound a little agitated and then grab my clipboard with some inventory print outs and walk around my warehouse. Nobody's stopping an angry corporate cog with a clipboard.	0
What's a thing your SO does every day, that you can't stand?	She opens or pours herself three or four different drinks in multiple places in the house and never drinks more than half of one.	Um...he used to drive a Pontiac G5, and that was a pain in the ass? I'd volunteer to drive it when he had a headlight or taillight out (it's less risky for a white police department employee to get pulled over than a black man). But now he drives a Kia Soul with no electrical problems, so, yay!	1
People who live in cold climates, what's an everyday thing that you have to do that people who live in warmer climates wouldn't think about? People in warmer climates, what's an everyday thing that you have to do that people in colder climates wouldn't think about?	When you're coming in from walking through snow, you kick your boots against every stair as you ascend, to loosen the snow off of them. You have to keep a windshield scraper in your car to scrape the ice off. In your home, you have to remove the screens and replace them with storm windows.	For our southern friends, if you ever visit the north during winter months and find your car iced over, a quick way to take care of it is to pour near boiling water on the windshield. You will not have a speck left.	1
What’s the most misunderstood concept about your mental disorder?	That all schizophrenics are batshit crazy. I am fine most of the time I just ocassionally see stuff. I space out too, but don't we all?	Bipolar does not mean changing from one emotion to the next within minutes. They last weeks at a time and there are, indeed, neutral states.	0
To police officiers: Do you ever get sick of the instant traffic you create when driving around because people become hyper-aware of their speeds around you?	We build police cars at work. Yes this is really annoying sometimes when we are picking up or delivering squad cars. On the other hand, when a fleet of 15 police cars is barreling down the interstate in one big group than everyone gets the hell out of the way and it can be really pleasant.	I drive an STI. If I pass a cop, and he isn't in a sugar coma, he'll notice the giant wing and probably PIT me off the road immediately. Cops hate the wing.	1
I've been told that when you meet the right person, you know immediately. How come when you meet the wrong person, it takes a year and a half?	Ive recently met the right person but am currently with who I thought was the right person. Working on sorting that out ASAP...wish me luck reddit	Because knowing something immediately is usually bullshit. And when you meet the wrong one, you delude yourself into believing they're great because you want them to be great.	0
Who is the creepiest person in your neighborhood and why?	Am I the only one who is a little put off by the number of people who are equating disabled people with "creepy" people? They didn't choose to be inappropriate. They're probably like that because they never received proper instruction in social skills growing up/had caregivers who enforced expectations for behavior.	I don't know if this guy is still around, but while growing up there was a guy who only showed up at night at this streetlight lit corner and would be in the "take a knee position" and wore a black hoodie with black sweatpants and black boots. I was convinced he was a assassin.	0
Cheating Girlfriend on audio. Can someone help me clean it up?	Please don't fall for the "OMG YOU CAUGHT ME IN A LIE, I WILL KILL MYSELF IF YOU LEAVE ME" get up. Seriously, she is at her parents' house, they are able to watch her, and hopefully she owned up to what she did, but it's not likely. You done good, detective. Now that you have the evidence, the semi-confession, the truth, you're still circling the solution? Maybe you didn't want to find what you did, but reality is reality, time to live in it. Get rid of her, it's only been eight months. In the big picture, that's a blink of an eye. You can do it! You deserve honesty. Everyone does.	Check your states wiretapping laws, you may have committed a crime. TAKE THE CLIP DOWN NOW !!!!! Delete your post, or if you can't change it to eliminate any mention of a recording.	1
Men of reddit, what is something that women think turns men on, but in reality does nothing for you?	Like we give a fuck. Why is it so important we be perfect sexual beings? Half the answers here complain about behaviors women display because of internalized oppression. We baby talk because we are constantly told we are more attractive at younger ages. We act dumb because we are told not to be smarter than men. It's not men's fault but it's not ours either. This question perpetuates the idea that everything a woman does should meet the expectations of men and I'm fucking done with it. A lot of people are.	When a woman plays 'hard to get,' I play a game called 'looking elsewhere.' Seriously, that hard to get bullshit is a massive turnoff.	0
Which teacher did you hate the most and why?	The art teacher who yelled at me for not being able to draw instead of helping me to learn. Years later I still can't draw.	I didn't have any really bad teachers at school, but I disliked our Literature and Russian Language teacher greatly. Mostly, because I hated the subject - being an avid reader of western science fiction from early childhood, I found Russian classic literature extremely boring and irritating, with heroes who were constantly tragic and never achieved anything before an untimely death or something. In a manner of all literature teachers, she was always full of "what the author really meant to say" and "what this character represents". Also, she was the one who directed all our school plays, and she was constantly pestering me to play a part. Which I had absolutely no intention of doing, because I hated those banal, sanctimonious plays (full of praise for school and learning), and mostly wanted to be left alone and do my own thing (which was to go home and keep learning programming).	1
[Serious] Judging by your appearance, what is one thing people wouldn't guess you know how to do?	A cartwheel. I'm 6'4", 260 lbs. But I'll roll down a hill sideways on my hands and feet like a majestic bearded giant, over and over, without falling, like a motherfucker.	Rape you and your whole squad at COD. I'm 5'11 210 muscle in the army. PEW PEW SCRUB WURR U AT.	1
What horrible things did you do as a kid?	When my sister and I were little (young enough to believe in Santa) I got a box and filled it with sticks and charcoal. I wrote "To: Melody, From: Santa" on it. Put it under the Christmas tree and let her open it Christmas morning. She cried, and I was grounded the rest of winter break.	Stole my mom's car when I was around 3. I rode shotgun in my youth before passenger side airbags and paid a little too much attention. She didn't know I had the keys when I was "playing" in the car.	1
Had to not laugh out loud when I overheard a GameStop employee explain to a mother about Saints Row 3 and the dildo sword. What are some of the funniest situations you have had to watch an employee handle?	This one huge guy was trying to get on a roller coaster, and he was clearly too big and wasn't gonna fit in the seat, probably bend the track lol, the guy running the show just ran to him shouting "No way sir! No way!" It was pretty awkward because he had to do the walk of shame off the ride.	Woman called up the vet I worked for, concerned about her bird who had been acting odd. I had to explain to her that her bird was masturbating with its fuzzy toy. So awkward.	0
Add 'ING' to the end of a movie title, what's it about now?	Kill Billing: A woman wakes up from a coma with a vengeance and dedicates her life to wreaking havoc on the accounting department at work.	Suicide Squatting - taking a shit and killing yourself at the same time. ie, a movie about the making of Suicide Squad.	1
What is the worst episode of a great tv show?	"Fly" S03E10 Breaking Bad. It is sometimes compared with The Sopranos S03E11, in praising it. I disagree as it lacks any humor or and only intensifies the horrible feeling for Hank that the life he spends inside this drug lab is the most important thing to him and during this episode his family and children are completely forgotten and nothing matters for him at this particular juncture is the personal satisfaction ensuring perfection in his production of his meth.	That episode from The Office where Nellie casually strolls in and steals Andy's job and nobody doing anything about it. God that was infuriating.	0
What's something you've always done that you've considered perfectly normal, only to recently discover that it was not?	When I was younger I hated pasta sauce. So when we ate pasta, I would grab butter and melt the butter in the pasta, and then mix in cinnamon. I did it all the time and it became normal for my family. Then I went to a friends house and asked for cinnamon when they were serving pasta for dinner. Everyone watched me like I was a science experiment as I prepared, and then ate my cinnamon pasta.	Rape. I thought the way I was doing it wasn't "legitimate", so I figured it was fine. Apparently it's still rape. Who knew?	1
When does being frugal cross the line to being cheap?	Cheap is taking dips in quality that outweigh the savings, or trying to get others to cover costs that are yours.	My dad's parents were mean as fuck. He is their only son and eldest child. My mother's parents helped my parents find a house when they got married and my grandad on that side installed all the cabinets and cupboards in the house for them. My grandmother got them a fridge. What did my dad's parents get him? Nothing, and no excuse too.	1
What plot would be resolved in seconds if the characters behaved realistically and logically?	The US Presidential elections. There is no way a literate and educated set of voters would vote for Trump. Or that someone would continue to behave that badly once elected. It all needs to be taken down a notch or season 2 is going to be really boring.	Jurassic World. Wait for the blonde girl in the control center to confirm to you the location of the Indominus before going into the pen.	0
What happened the last time that "house noise" turned out to not be just a "house noise"?	Well it wasn't a noise but it was a feeling. That feeling that there's something or someone in the room with you so you need to open your eyes. I was falling asleep to a YouTube video in bed when suddenly I felt like someone was way up in my personal space. I opened my eyes and there was big shadow in the corner of my room. I tried to rationalize what it was for about 30 seconds until it vanished. Turns out my old neighbor had died. Not the first time this has happened to me.	I heard a noise outside my bedroom window and thought it was just the wind blowing the tree branches against it. Ignored it, went back to what I was doing, and suddenly I just get this feeling that I'm being watched. Happen to see something move out of the corner of my eye near the window, I turned, startled, and what did I see? A black snake breaking in through a small gap between my AC and wall, his body rising up while he looked straight at me and flicked his tongue in my direction.	0
What is it weird to be too good at?	Some of my friends are into anime so fucking much that they're able to identify so many characters from so many animes. And yes, they're weird af.	Drinking. When you can drink 8 beers in a sitting and people say "I didn't think you were that drunk!" And you notice you were it's not a good look.	0
Reddit, what was your worst or most awkward first date?	I was set up with a cousin on a blind date. First 5 minutes was spent trying to figure out where we had seen each other.	She was really negative about almost everything and refused to acknowledge that Taiwan is considered a part of China. No, she was not Tiwanese, or even Asian. I wasn't saying it should be, just that the United States, UN etc, on paper, recognize it as such. She refused to hear it and then said "oh you don't pay attention to the news I guess". Uuggh. EDIT: apparently reddit agrees with her : /	1
I attended high school in a small town in Texas with a girl I went to kindergarten with in Guam. What's something you found out that made you realize how small the world can be?	My father lived in Texas as a child and was best friends with the next door neighbor's son. They fell out of contact when my dad moved away and he didn't see or hear from his friend for over 40 years. The home next to ours was sold recently and guess who moves in? They became next door neighbors for the second time!	I was born in LaPorte, IN. A company called Berkel, which had invented the first rotary blade meat slicer, built a factory in LaPorte, in 1915. In 2009, my family took a trip to Italy. One of the Tuscan towns we visited was called Montepulciano. In the town, there was a little antique shop which contained a Berkel meat slicer! I dunno, we thought it was amazing. Sorry for the boring writing.	1
Redditors born on Feb 29th. How/when do you celebrate your birthday and are there any little annoyances that come along with it?	I believe that if you're born Midnight of the 29th to noon means your legal birthdate is Feb. 28th. After noon to midnight means your legal birthdate is the 1st of March	It it always a good talking point. I have mine on the 1st March on years there is no 29th. A big positive is no one forgets your birthday. Sometimes automated systems get a bit confused when I enter my birthday but it is very rare. Edit: Unlike seemingly all the other 29ers here I don't mind people calling me by my leap age or making jokes about it. While it's normal for me I get that it's unusual for most people.	0
What is your funniest joke?	I walked up to this beautiful young woman at the bar and told her "Baby you are definitely getting laid tonight" And she she said "Really? How do you know?" and I told her "Because I'm stronger than you..."	Man is standing behind a woman in the supermarket. She notices him looking in her cart which only has a couple items. He says "You must be single." She says "How can you tell by just looking at my cart?" He says "Because you are fucking ugly."	0
What is the most shocking thing you've found out about someone you thought you knew really well?	I'll give you a bit of background. My SO was a school teacher, a really good one at that and he started getting quit ill, coughing and spluttering all the time... I was concerned and he saw a specialist. He found out he had lung cancer, never smoked a day in his life... He finally had surgury and was deemed cured, for now. He started becoming distant all of a sudden, I thought he was cheating on my. When I confronted him I found out he was manufacturing methamphetamines with one of his ex students	there is someone i have known all my life that i recently found out that when he was younger, he shot his cousin in the head during a game of russian roulette.	0
I love seeing couples where one mate is more attractive. What weird things make your day better?	When I take a poop and theres nothing on the TP when I wipe. I'm always like "Oh you!, Asshole" :)	When I see a couple with one partner being more attractive than the other I think one of three things: (If he is hideous and she is smoking) * He has a HUGE member AND/OR * He is absolutely minted (If he is really handsome and she looks like a foot) * Her Dad is minted I have a very cynical outlook, don't I...	1
What are some random animal facts that you can say off the top of your head?	mice can fit through a hole the size of a ballpoint pen dolphins know when a woman is pregnant because they have extremely good hearing and can hear two heart beats male sea horses get preggers having sex with a horse will kill you wasps are assholes	Elephants think humans are cute, so they reach out with their trunks to pet us. If an elephant sees a human asleep it will get sad thinking it died and will cover it with leafs	1
I gave my niece a laptop on her birthday and she screamed at me because it wasn't brand new. What's the most ungrateful thing you see someone do?	Wait, so today is her birthday, you give her the laptop at dinner, she calls later, and you've already sold the laptop, all in one day?	I always wanted to believe that this type of behavior only happens on television, I mean you are getting free shit, how can you not like that? I get socks for christmas and I get fucking excited: fucking free socks man	0
What are the most acceptable things in society which completely takes a 180° turn if the gender roles are changed in that situation?	Not sure if it's actually acceptable, but women who go into men's toilet because the women's one is full. If it's reversed shit goes to hell real quick	If a woman gets abused, raped etc it's bad and people are empathetic. But when it's a guy, people laugh and are not that emphatic. Males are always below women these days. I really hate it.	1
[Serious] Why isn't personal finance a mandatory high school class?	Because that would bring down the entire banking system. Just imagine what would happen if a considerable proportion of people stopped living on credit, and instead started to budget their life within their means? The system is set up in such a way that it relies on people being largely ignorant of its inner workings.	There are only *so many* hours in a school day. My kids took a personal finance unit in school....I believe it was a semester long. The one who's personality leans toward *instant gratification* didn't learn any useful lessons in the class. The one who's more conservative, financially, pretty much already knew the basics. I'm not sure it would really help at that age, quite honestly. It's something that should be taught *throughout childhood*, in the formative years, and then reinforced in early adulthood when it's applicable.	0
Reddit, How are you still "cheating the system"?	In college, we learned how to flick pennies into the laundry machine to make it think it was a quarter. Because $4.50 a load is a fucking crime.	I go to the selve-serve coffee bins at Whole Foods, fill up a bag of their most expensive beans (usually $11-16 a pound), then write the PLU of their standard 6.99 roast. It gives me way too much satisfaction.	1
Why are you single?	Couple of reasons, one of the biggest ones is probably how clueless I am, I just how no idea how to handle even slightly romantic or sexual situations. also I'm rather shy, but don't look the part (I'm pretty confident in other areas) which also makes this more difficult. and finally I guess I'm just lazy, trying to work on that part but it's hard to change	I have trouble trusting women because my mum abandoned me when I was 6. She came back when I was 8 but the damage was already done	1
Liberals and Conservatives: which news sources from "the other side" do you regularly read to make sure you're not in a bubble?	Well, to be quite honest out if the big three news channels, two are center, and one is not what i would consider news....we all know which one im talking about. You see, the US doesnt really have an active progressive wing. What we call liberals in this country, everyone else calls centre-right. Our conservatives would be extreame right, and our moderates would be called conservatives. There has been a huge shift in the past two decades to the right, and now even someone like me, a moderate, is considered liberal. Hell, even Regan would be liberal by today's standards.	I assume that at least some of what I hear isn't true or is propaganda. When a story seems too good to be true, I look at foreign news sources (BBC, CBC, Al Jazeera) to see how they are spinning it or if they are even talking about it.	0
What’s your opinion on cancel culture?	It's stupid as fuck. People are bringing up things decades in the past and acting like people can't/aren't allowed to change. Sure some things are pretty serious but most of it is just petty.	It depends on each situation. That is why everyone argues about it. For examples. I lied to my mom when I was 5. Should I be cancelled? Obviously not. No one would make that accusation seriously. I raped my mom when I was 5. Should I be cancelled? Obviously yes. It is good that we are talking about cancel culture because it certainly can be toxic and damaging. But if you ask a question that broad we will never find answers. I would ask about specific situations or the process of cancel cultures.	1
Amazon have just replaced my out of date and out of warranty Kindle, no questions asked. I'm amazed. What other companies do you know of that have genuine and honest customer service?	I returned a 15 year old backpack to LL Bean when one of the straps broke. They replaced it with a brand new one..	WTF .. I've just been charged 50£ for a replacement and have to return my old kindle ... not happy amazon !	1
What is the dumbest way you've injured yourself?	This one time my boss had a brand new gadget. It didn't seem to have that much colours, just alot of grey tones. Nonetheless it smelled like something awesome that wasn't mine yet. Anyway one day he was at his desk and the gadget was just laying there. So i just walked in you know, pretending not to have seen it. As soon as he turned his head i leap on to the desk and snatch the gadget from his desk and dash out of there. Sadly enough the door was closed and i face-planted straight into it. After that he just screamed "bad dog" for a while, you know the usual.... Still got to take a piss on it afterwards though	A few days ago I was trying to rip open a stubborn bag of nuts. It suddenly gave in and I ended up punching myself in the nose, causing a nosebleed.	0
What is the most unusual thing about your body?	My chest (I mean I biologically have a females chest) I’m a trans guy so it causes me dysphoria, so in my eyes that’s unusual to me because in my heart and mind I’m a male.	I have a medical condition called situs Inversus where all my organs are flipped and on the opposite side. It doesn't really have any major effects on my life though just a cool little secret that nobody believes when I tell them lol.	0
What are some annoying things people say?	"boy, you sure are quiet.". If you want to talk that's fine but this statement just baffles me, what do I even say to that. Also, if you have to ask if I'm having fun yet..why? Any sort of filler conversation is slightly annoying to me.	“I don’t like Harry Potter.” TAKE IT BACK. You clearly either don’t have a soul or you’re lying to intentionally piss me off. Either way, you’re on my shit list.	1
What's the most irrational thing your pet is afraid of?	A watermelon. It's ridiculous, actually. Brought a watermelon home and my dog barked at it and eyed it warily for like half an hour. Dogs are weird.	My dog is scared of chewing gum.She hates when someone blows a bubble and it pops. Even the chewing whacks her out.	1
What is the most B.S. catchphrase and why?	"Make America Great again." This statement not only neglects the fact that America was never really great to begin with, and it implies that it was once ever great. Greatness is a concept of the past that cant really happen in real time.	"Did I do that?" Yeah Urkel, that thing you just did? Is that what you're referring to? Yes, the action you *just* took, was indeed taken by you. You just did that. It was you.	0
Redditors, have you ever had a dream so sweet and good, when you woke up it made you feel sad that it ended? What was it about?	Yeah I had a dream where my crush actually smiled and talked to me. Then I woke up and remembered that she had told one of her friends that I was weird.	Donuts (chocolate old fashioned and pink icing with sprinkles like on The Simpsons). I told my wife about my dream and she decided she'd go get us donuts. I sent her the very specific pictures and she instead came back with Bavarian cream and powdered donut holes. I'm married to a monster.	1
If Abraham Lincoln ran for president in 2016 what dirt would the media dig up on him? How would they portray him as Hitler/Satan?	Well he was homeschooled wasn't he? Taught himself law so he could be a lawyer, and later get into government iirc. His campaign could definitely spin it as him being self-motivated and not being part of the "elite" class, but his opposition would definitely try to portray him as a skilled amateur rather than a professional expert in the topic of law.	They could just come up with, "he says mean things and cares about national security." Just ask the liberals they will tell you how evil those things are.	1
What movie plot-hole is impossible to ignore?	The Santa Clause If none of the adults believe in Santa wouldn't they wonder where the fuck all the presents came from every year?	I haven't read the books, and I would hope that it is somehow addressed in the books, but my old roommate and I once watched the Lord of the Rings trilogy back to back with all the extended scenes, and my question is this: Why not just fly the fucking eagles to Mt. Doom in the first place? Eleven hours! Eleven hours of my life! ;D hehehe	1
What's something you used to think is bullshit but now believe?	The Deep State. Michael Moore went from accusing the Deep State of complicity in 9/11 to openly rooting for them to overthrow the democratically elected President of the United States. The moral high horse left is siding with & cheerleading for the same Deep State that assassinated JFK. Incredible.	I used to think primer wasn't necessary on new drywall. I figured you could just paint it and primer was just a way for paint companies to make more money. I no longer believe this	0
Gamers of Reddit, what game came out of nowhere and left it's mark on you unlike most any other, and why?	Overwatch I'm 35 and play games but not like a maniac. Since a buddy bugged me to try the free beta I have been hooked and spent way too much time playing that game and wayyyyyy too much money on boxes.	Braid. A small indie puzzle platformer I've never heard of. I can't remember why I even gave it a try. The graphics, the music and the twist at the end just lead me to sit there for a minute contemplating what just happened.	0
Americans of Reddit, what's something that America gets shit for that is actually completely reasonable in context?	Our gun culture. We're borne of armed insurrection. We're the children of castoffs and wanderers and I don't want the only gun in a tense situation to belong to the other guy.	Laws on Jaywalking. Coming from the UK, I never understood this, but having been to Seattle a few times - I totally get it. Most roads in cities (in Seattle at least) are at least three lanes wide, and each lane about twice the width of a UK one. At the end of every block there always seems to be a crossing. Would be madness to chance it.	0
Teachers of Reddit, how did you deal with a student that had a crush on you?	i did the only mature and professional thing i could think of at the time. took her to the principal's office and had all the school's staff run train on her, me being first.	I’ve had preschoolers who want to marry me. I say I can’t until they get a job and can drive a car.	0
What celebrity do you have an irrational hatred for?	I dont know if he is a celebrity. But the kid who use to whisper "Zoom, Zoom" for in the Mazda commercials.	I'll be downvoted, but John Stewart. Politics aside, he has blatantly lied on his show, and at that point it's not satire. Colbert is funny though and so is John oliver, I liked his fifa segment	1
What tv series isn't worth finishing?	Finding Bigfoot. (or as I like to call it "WHAT WAS THAT?") I mean, guys, they're never going to freaking find bigfoot. And if they do it will be ruined by news coverage.	The Office. The last season is completely garbage and really anything after Michael Scott is when it starts to go downhill.	1
What scumbag thing did you do to your friend(s) as a child?	I tied my friend to the basketball net in the playground with her dress straps. I tied it too tight and couldn't get it undone. When the recess bell rang I said sorry and ran inside. She cried there until a teacher found her and had to cut her dress.	One time I left him borrow one of my ds games, and he let me borrow one of his, thing is months passed, and I was done playing with his game, and I wanted mine back, but he wouldn't give it to me, I was mad because I even went to his house to ask for the damn game, and he always made an excuse to not give it to me, so since I was really mad, I broke his game by steping on it several times, so one day, one of my friends helped me get my game, so when he finally give it to me and he asked for his...well, he started crying when he saw what was left of his game, but I mean, I wouldn't have do it if he gave my game when I asked him first...	1
What company has forever won your business?	Apple. Ever since my first ipod touch i've loved the interface and simplicity of all apple products and will most likely not have any other phone than an iphone.	Local Bike Shop. I was about to buy a brand new bike for 1200 and the owner of the shop said to hold on and ran upstairs to grab a bike that was a year old but never used, sold it to me at cost. Saved 500 bucks and they've serviced it for free every time I go in. The guys who work on the bikes are just as passionate about riding and fixing bikes. The salesman had greasy hands, I trust people who work on what they sell.	0
Guys of Reddit, what's the creepiest/weirdest way a woman has hit on you?	She said 'lemme smell yo dick' and I was all like 'ok, but if it smells good then you should suck it' ... And then she sniffed it.... said it smelled nice... And then she sucked it. Then I have her a high five and went back out to the party. If I'd known about Reddit then I would have patted her on the top of the head and said 'that'll do pig, that'll do'	I used to drive a limo (well, a sedan service, but it wasn't a stretch). I picked up a rich, drunk, middle-aged couple, and the woman got her face up between the front seats and stared at me for a few minutes, then she said, "so, do you wanna fuck tonight?" I didn't say anything, pretending she was not talking to me, and I met her husband's eyes in the mirror. He was just rolling his eyes and shaking his head sadly. When we arrived at their resort, the bellmen had to literally drag her out of the car.	0
People who have made 180’s in life, what happened and what did you do to change?	I was a law abiding, productive member of society, with a great career, home and family. Then one day I decided to go to the casino for fun. 2 years later I was a convicted felon with no home, less family and no career. 180’s are not always good things.	I was bullied at 6th grade. Gladly I wasn't out of the closet yet because my class mates would have got another reason to bully me, apart from me being a-social, nerd and a weirdo. After the school year ended I chose to be in a diffrent school in a gifted students class. A year afterwards I got accepted to the young science team in my country (it is the first period, so I am extremly lucky). I have got lots of friends and I am happy. It is more of a 120° turn since I still had my friends in 6th grade and I was in a gifted students program earlier. ^(Technically it is a 360° turn since if it was a 180° turn you would just continue in the same way instead of doing the exact oposite.)	1
What is the stupidest thing you have ever temporarily believed?	That an omnipotent being created the world in 6 days, then created man, gave him free will and cast him and his wife from paradise for eating from a tree that would give them knowledge. Then he impregnated a virgin with himself so that he could come and die to save us all from our sins. An omnipotent being is only capable of having one son and he has to die in order for all of us to be forgiven? Sounds pretty ridiculous. He also doesn't want us to eat shrimp. It's evil.	That a dude dressed in a red suit would pull a B&E and just leave things that I liked under pine tree.	0
I've changed my sweater three times at work today to see if anyone would notice. What have you done to entertain yourself at work today?	I do some part time work at university hockey games as the PA announcer. At the beginning of the games, when I read the scratches, I will often throw in movie characters. Like "#29 John McClane". No one has noticed yet. Yippie kay yay	My co-worker used to ejaculate into our female co-workers' water bottles. One uptight bitch finally caught on and made a huge fuss about it and got him fired and on the newspaper. Ruined the poor guys life.	1
[Serious]What is a really cool "Dad trick" that will impress or surprise a small child?	If you're microwaving rice, noodles, etc, put a well (like a crater) in the center of it so that it heats more evenly.	Look at the red light, when you see the light in the other lane turn yellow wait and a second then exclaim "now!" The child will live in fear of your wizard powers.	0
Redditors: Are you ever too afraid to post because you fear peoples snarky reactions?	I hardly ever post because people always down vote and i find it pretty asshole because its a genuine question that i really need a suggestion or answer too.	lol no you would have the the biggest bitch in the world to get nervous about what random people who you don't know say about some shit you said on reddit	1
How would our culture/life be different if our planet was the size of jupiter?	For anyone wondering the Earth's mile radius is 3,959 miles and Jupiter's is 43,441 miles. A lot of wars were fought over land so I could imagine everyone getting along with each other just a bit more.	We'd be short and we'd have ten times our current population. We'd also have probably also been to other planets and be much further into our studies and sciences.. Imagine 10x scientists/geniuses who would make the different beyond the 10x jackasses.	1
Why shouldn't I move to your country?	Trump. Not only him though, that we could have elected him in the first place speaks volumes for where we currently are.	The "Gringo tax". If you look or sound foreign, people will asume you must be filthy rich and they'll charge you more than they would charge a regular mexican.	0
What is the worst way you saw someone get fired from their job?	Crashed a forklift into a row of electronics bins and damaged tens of thousands of dollars worth of merchandise. Just hung his head, grabbed his stuff from the break room, and walked to the manager's office to get fired.	We'll call her, V.T, she was fired for unknown reasons, many rumors but I haven't heard any confirmation. The CEO who we'll call E.P fired this awesome employee who everyone liked. E.P has since resigned.	1
What is a food that you're not always craving, but when you start eating it you find you can't stop because it tastes so good?	Sour Cream Pringles, or regular old Goldfish crackers. I rarely buy them, but when I do, the serving suggestion is just that. A suggestion.	Bacon. The first time I went to an all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet, I nearly cried when I realized I could enjoy an entire plate of bacon.	1
Today, during my job interview for a hedge fund, an amputee walked past, and his prosthetic leg somehow slipped loose. He fell onto the café floor. I sprung up, and helped him. The employer liked how I handled the situation. He hired me on the spot. Any other strange interview stories?	I was once asked during an interview if I could start on Monday. I said that I wouldn't be able to because I wanted to give two weeks notice at my current employer. The interviewer that asked the question (there were two) then laughed and told me that I was the first person interviewing for that position that had not gotten that question wrong. I'm now in my seventh year with that company.	17 and unemployed, father makes me look for a job in the classifieds. i didn't want to work, but he was taking me to the interviews anyways. first interview was at a big respectful company. i went wearing flip-flops and a white shirt that says "I DO DRUGS", i was hoping that if i dont find a job my dad would stop talking about it. somehow magically got the job. edit: seriously? i answered the question and this is what i get?	1
Just had my office manager call everyone to the lobby to laugh at me (28 years old) for having ProActiv delivered to my office, saying "that's worse than having porn delivered here man!" What's the most unexpectedly hurtful thing that's happened to you at work?	I really don't understand how ordering face wash subjects you to ridicule. "Look at this weirdo! He washes his *face*!"	Maaaannn he just made you some serious $$$, best thank him. Also lawyer up and sue for defamation of character.	1
Guys of reddit, what do you really want for Valentine's Day?	They want steak and blowjobs, we've been over this!! Personally, I'm gonna let my man treat me to dinner, steak is a-okay. (; I will however definitely be giving my best friend/boyfriend/care taker an excellent BJ. Along with a new Altamont hat, and DVD pack #2 of the Regular Show... aaaaaah yeah.	I'd like to continue our tradition of shifting valentine's day to a mutually agreed future date that allows us to buy twice as many flowers and eat at a much better restaurant for the same price.	0
You meet the parents of your SO for the first time. How do you make it as awkward as possible?	If you're a girl, flirt with the dad. If you're a guy, flirt with the dad when she's not around.	Hey Mr. Pewterschmidt, based on what you've seen with your wife, what can we expect in terms of droopage here? We talking a slight slope or the full fried-eggs-hanging-on-a-nail thing?	1
What amazing skill did you have as a kid, but lost it as you got older?	Memorizing numbers, I could recite phone numbers, address and birthdays for most of my family, friends and some classmates. I still remember numbers I use a lot but not like I used too.	Comedy I used to be the class clown with amazing timing. Today, it's "better keep my mouth shut or I'll get my ass sent to HR". So many great jokes left on the cutting room floor.	0
Teachers/Students of Reddit - What is your greatest expulsion/suspension story?	A friend of mine was expelled for having a t-shirt on that said "Show me your boobs, bitch!". Shit hit the fan and one of the biggest daily newspaper around here brought up the story. Sadly nothing happened as the principal defended the teacher. Edit: Fix'd the entire post.	It was my freshman year of college, and it was finals week, and therefore 24-hour quiet hours in my dorm. Any violation of finals week quiet got you kicked the fuck out. One night I got into the elevator with a floormate and three of his guests. One of his guests had difficulty operating the elevator buttons, and when she got it right the guy and his guests applauded her great achievement. Elevator door opens at the ground floor to the bitchiest RA in existence. She asks for our IDs. Guy and his friends try to explain to her that I was just standing there, but she didn't give a fuck. I got called in to the resident director's office the following morning and I got evicted. I got evicted from my dorm for being in an elevator while other people clapped.	0
What rules were created just because of you?	everyone who has entered the local skating rink since 1983 has had their bags searched because my gf and i used to toss our empty pint bottles of alcohol in the lockers... that we smuggled in *in our pants*.	Our 8th grade class got the word Runescape banned. The teacher had it written on the board. If you said it you got kicked out.	1
Guys of reddit, what are some "bro code" unspoken rules that you always follow?	If you see a bro chatting up someone they're clearly interested in, you only interject if it's to make said bro look good. edit: something like "Joe has the biggest dick I've ever sucked"	Even if you know he’s 100% wrong you pretend to agree with him and show sympathy when he gets dumped. “Yes, she was totally a crazy psycho and you did nothing wrong”. Then when that bro isn’t around you all quietly agree that she was totally right and he was a dumbass. It’s never spoken of again.	1
Men who have a seen a woman give birth, what was your thought process?	I saw a video of it in the seventh grade. It was...pretty intense. Thank god my wife opted for a c-section.	>Holy crap, it's really happening. Everyone in here is sweating way more than they talked about in birthing class; that nurse over there is literally dripping onto the floor. Man I'm sleepy, why is it so hot, wtf is that white webbing on the baby's head? Holy shit, that's a baby's face blowing out my wife's business. Man it's hot. Have I been breathing? Did someone just shut off the lights? "Doing good honey! Slap me around if you need to!" It took a very firm tongue bite to keep from blacking out about there.	0
How is it to live in a country with time zones?	It's pretty awesome. I like being able to talk to people when I'm at work before they head to class.	In the US on the west coast. The east coast, tends to close up shop earlier. So even though it's only 2pm on the west coast, if you want to call a business on eastern standard time, it'll already be 5pm, usually when they close. Same thing in the morning. You want to call someone on the east coast first thing in the morning at 9am. It's already 12pm and thus lunch time for them. When I used to play MMO's, those on the east coast had to go to bed by 9pm because it was already midnight for them. If I played until midnight, it would be 3am in the morning for them.	0
What Movie was the biggest let down of 2015?	star wars 7, it was just too predictable at times and I didn't think it lived up to its name	Aloha. All star cast, Emma Stone is easy on the eyes...The story line made zero fucking sense. One of the reviews I read put it perfectly: "Aloha is the worst thing to happen to Hawaii since the attack on Pearl Harbor."	0
What is a problem in 2019 that would not be one in 1989?	Being left the fuck alone. Used to be you could disappear for the day and nobody was getting a hold of you until you came home.	Being "misgendered" You're "misgendering" yourself by saying you're something else. Look between your legs, there's your gender! And before someone replies with the intersex strawman, there are other indicators of whether your body is female or male	1
Gamers of Reddit, the last video game you died in is how you will die in real life. So, how will you die?	Me and my buddy Jeb are gonna die in an awesome spaceship explosion. Our ship was designed by an idiot that has no business designing rocket ships.	Radiation poisoning from holding depleted uranium fuel rods. Note to mod maker of IC2: depleted uranium is depleted of its radioactivity! That's what depleted means!	1
What human interaction is memorable to you, but the other person has probably forgotten?	Both of my parents were murdered one night as we exited an opera. A police officer at the station after the event placed his jacket over my shoulders and told me it would be alright. I have spent my whole life fighting for (raspy voice) JUSTICE...	When my friend from college was murdered it really shook up the whole school. I went to her funeral. I chose to stand next to my professor who was there alone instead of sitting with my friends. There were no seats. He is easily my father's age. We stood in silence. When I started crying during the service he got flustered and handed me a tissue from his pocket and promised it was clean. It was probably the most emotional moment I've ever shared with another person. He probably doesn't remember.	0
What 'nice gesture' annoys you?	In our chat messenger at work: > bob: "Hey idoocoolthings" > Me: "hi bob" > 5 minutes of silence > bob: "I have a question about blagdhjak" > Me: "Fire away" > 5 minutes later > bob: "Sorry, got interrupted" > Me: ~~"Me too, 10 minutes ago someone distracted me from my work when they could have started the effing conversation with their question"~~ "that's okay" Don't wait for me to respond, just give me your questions. It's business, we're not here to waste time bob.	My coworkers saying "Good Morning" or "Hi" to me as soon as I arrive at work. Before I even sit down. I like to slowly ease into the day and in general just not a morning person.	1
Medical professionals of Reddit, what was a time where a patient ignored you and almost died because of it?	I have now realised, because of this thread, how much i hate America. Im glad i live in a country where theres Free healthcare.	Had a throat cancer patient, we offered him surgery to remove the tumor (it was a fairly conservative surgery) he left because he didn't want a mutilating surgery and his daughter in law had been studying magnet therapy and "she was quite good with it" (his words) he came back a year later, and was out of reach from any treatment, his cancer was so advanced that there was nothing we could do for him.	0
What instantly pisses you off?	Social Justice Warriors. They are ridiculous in college... Ordered French toast for breakfast once, the girl behind me goes "French toast? What's wrong with regular toast you racist!" I thought she was joking. She was not. I got lectured about race(?) and gender (I said "dude, leave me alone") until I got my food and then she followed me a good distance across campus. French isn't even a race... Edit: yeah I can see why this is hard to believe but shit like this happens pretty frequently in colleges in America. She wanted me to call it "egged toast" or something like that to be pc. Taking my English & art gen eds was actually scary... There is a reason sjw memes exist, but believe what you want ¯\_(ツ)_/¯	When a just a few people at work are slacking but comments are made in a staff meeting that should be directed at them specifically. That can be really demoralizing.	0
What’s the worst character development you’ve seen on a TV show?	Capitan marvel from the movie capitan marvel that came out a few weeks ago, she hardly changed throughout the whole movie	Cleveland Brown from family guy was just your mild mannered black neighbor who just went about his day. Than he got hks own show and just became token idiot dad who fucks up everything except now he's black and has a mustache	0
Haunted house employees of Reddit, what are your best stories from the job?	Every year there are new memes/slogans kids and teens love to quote: 'WHAT ARE THOOOOOOOOSE?' 'CAN YOU DAB?' 'I'M PICKLE RIIIIIIIIICK!' Not the best story but I weep.	So I had been put in charge of running a haunted house for a work family event. The only snaffu was that I had not been told it would be for 3-10 year olds. The best story that came from it would he the jump scare where the mother knocked her child over and ran leaving this screaming kid with me.	0
What is the weirdest thing you’ve seen or heard in a public restroom [NSFW]?	Someone startled me so I had to push the turd back in my ass. It was so cold and creamy. Never again.	When I was a college freshman, I went to a bathroom and used the stall on the opposite end because the first one was already taken. At one point, the guy in the first stall started groaning, breathing heavily and saying things like “right there, right there” followed by a big sigh and “There we go”. He was alone in the stall.	0
How sick do you have to be to take a day off?	Rarely. Unless it's the soul sickness. You know, that mental sickness of not being anywhere near able to put up with a single grain of bullshit and you're a mouse's cut hair away from taking Tim's stupid Garfield mug, smashing it into his teeth, and watching him drown on blood, tooth, and porcelain. Then I don't go.	You shouldn't be considering 'is this a sick day'. If you are, it isn't. Get your ass in to work. I've lost jobs by making the wrong decision then actually getting sick.	1
What small decision you've made, turned out to be the biggest?	I was unemployed and had to buy a new pair of shoes. I went to the factory store outlet of a shoe company and got a pair, then said to myself "wonder if they're hiring?" They were. It's been two years and I'm an assistant manager in the corporate office. Best pair of shoes I ever bought.	Left my uncle alone working on my kitchen backsplash while I went to the store. Ripped out my entire master bathroom during the hour I was gone, and demanded 5000 dollars I don;t have to fix it, which looks like it will ultimately lead to me being unable to refinance, and eventually losing my house to foreclosure.	1
I save voicemails of family members and friends; in case they die and the messages are the only way I would hear their voice again. Do you have any habits that are motivated by a morbid pretext?	I try to say "Love you" whenever I end a conversation on the phone with my wife or family, so that if anything terrible ever happened to them, I wouldn't regret the last thing I said to them.	I ejaculate inside women to create advance copies of myself and them in case we die. For some reason I have the urge to do this a lot. Kind of morbid.	1
I never understood how Prostitution (paid sex, in private) is illegal when the porn industry (paid sex, documented, exploited, published, major $$$) is perfectly "fine." Anyone have any insight??	Basically: - Christian fundamentalists - Republicans - Other retarded people - Obsolete laws that no-one will take the time or political risk to change - Women who would be jealous sex being commercially available In some parts of the world it is legal. In the UK there are so many loopholes ('Escorts', one-girl-to-an-apartment) that it is essentially legal. Here the police have far better things to do and politicians have far better things to argue over.	Prostitution isn't illegal at the federal level, it's left to the states to decide. Only Nevada allows it, and it's restricted by county population level. Most states won't license porn filmmakers. California will.	0
If you were a god what would you change about human body?	I would give humans the ability to self-heal damaged parts. You break a tooth, you regrow it, you get your arm chopped off, you regrow it.	If I were married to a woman, I would have a wife. But if I were married to a man, I would have a husband.	1
People who have had to train a new employee, what was your "we don't do that here" moment?	This actually happened the other day, but I work at a car wash and this new guy comes into the office smoking a cigarette and clocking in then goes outside and gets to work	I tell trainee ("Cherry") to mind the front for a few minutes while I go in the back to sort some bags and yell for me if she needs anything. I hear a "Hello? Excuse me, hello?" no more than five minutes into it. I go out to a very confused customer and no Cherry anywhere to be seen. I take care of him and go looking for her. Turns out the bitch just left and went to McDonald's because she was "just so hungry". She had came in with a Big Mac three hours before to start her shift.	0
What is something someone new to Reddit needs to know?	Did you know know that the sun's corona is millions of degrees hotter than the surface due to it being heated by the sound of the sun?	Everyone here is perfect and has never made a single mistake in their lives. However, all celebrities, political figures, parents, teachers, police officers, and business owners are inhuman monsters.	0
What book was so good that it made you read it in one sitting?	I bought A GAME OF THRONES in like April of my senior year of highschool (2008) and read the first book in a weekend. Later that month people couldn't comprehend why I was so sad/pissed off. Stupid weddings.	Enders Game. I then proceeded to read all of the Shadow series in about a week and a half. Enders Game is still one of my favorite books to this day. If you only saw the movie, please do yourself a favor and read the book.	0
Parents of Reddit, at what point did you realize your kid is with the person he/she'll marry?	Not a parent but my Dad told me that when I got diagnosed with diabetes he was afraid it might be too much for my then-girlfriend to handle. When she turned up in the hospital with a new backpack with extra compartments for emergency jelly beans, a book on cooking for diabetics and a massively positive outlook on the whole situation he said he knew she was in for the long haul.	The point that I realized my son was going to marry his girlfriend is when one day my son got up early one morning one Saturday (they were both visiting us). He made breakfast for the whole family. I'm talking bacon, eggs, hash browns, like a breakfast spread from a restaurant. It turns out he had driven to Denny's and bought all the food! However, when we were about half way through breakfast a lot of us were feeling uncharacteristically tired. We all feel asleep and woke up in our basement chained up. We had to saw our legs and arms off just to get free. It was some sick game of my son, bastard. There were some bitter feelings, but after my son proposed shortly after, all the warm feelings just washed that bitterness away. They've been married 50 years now.	1
What video game do you think all gamers need to play?	Cannot narrow it down to just one sorry so... Skyrim Call of duty Forza Minecraft Surely these games exemplify modern gaming.	Portal. It's easy to get the hang of and can be played by all ages, additionally its fucking hilarious Edit: Cheers for the gold :) Imma go get some cake	0
What was the first video game you fell in love with?	Age of Empires 2... Come to think of it, that's really not a bad one to have as your first.	Destiny back in 2014. I got it for my 11th birthday. That got me into gaming. I've been from Destiny to Gears to CoD. Contemplating going back to Destiny, probably getting Battlefield 1.	1
What is the most official way someone has called you an idiot?	...what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.	When you fail your driving test in Ireland you get an official "certificate of incompetence". It's coloured red if I recall.	0
What did the "quiet kid" in school do that surprised everyone?	Nothing yet. But once it's over it won't matter. I'll just live life the way I want to live it.	Got a tattoo beginning of senior year. Man, what a bad ass. Most of us 17 year Olds were highly impressed the quiet kid could do something so baller. Until we realized the tattoo was a name in big black letters down his arm. A name. His name in fact. He got his own first name tattooed down his arm. As if he was in danger of forgetting it.	0
What is that insignificant little memory you have that for some reason just never left you?	When I was really little, I once asked myself if it was possible to, through sheer will, commit some moment to memory, no matter how insignificant. Many years later, I still remember that exact moment. So the experiment was a success.	This is probably one of my earliest memories. I must have been about three at the time. The house my family lived in at the time was sort of long and narrow, so it had a staircase on each end of the house that went up to the second floor. I distinctly remember challenging my mom to a race up the stairs, her up one set and me up the other. I ran up the stairs as fast as I could and when I got to the top, I saw my mom already standing at the other end of the long hallway. I got really upset.	1
How do I ask my friend if he (she?) is a boy or girl without offending him/her?	Maybe ask the teacher/professor? Just be like, "I'm not trying to be rude or nosy, but because we're studying together, I kinda need to know if I should say 'he' or 'she' when referring to them within earshot of them"... Or "compare" ID's/Driver's licences.	Generally in men, the ring finger is closer in length to the middle finger than it is in women. Unless they are gay. Adams apple should be fairly obvious. Do they wear a bra? Does their underwear ever peak out? How about facial stubble?	1
Students who've had sex with their teachers, at what point did your relationship turn physical? How do you feel about it now?	I am not a student, I am a professor and I am very curious as to what the answers will be. I would never violate ethical protocol but under what context would the threshhold of a person's self control be potentially exceeded is information that would greatly help to avoid such situations. EDIT: Every single story is about female teachers with male students and most of it reeks of being completely false. This automatically makes the information useless on several levels..... sigh.	I had sex with my TA the night of the oral exam. No, that's not a double entendre. It was actually an exam in which I had to say my answers out loud. She was only a few years older than me, and we had a really strong rapport that became most evident during that exam. She asked if I wanted to come out and get drinks with her and a couple more students at the end of the exam. We got drinks. Then we shed the others to get high. Then we had sex. In addition to the oral exam, I was supposed to write a final paper. Needless to say, I never did. I did have some more sex with her, though. My grade reflected that.	0
What's the best book you've ever read?	The Book Thief by Markus Zusack. My mom bought it for me for Christmas when I was ten - Truly, the greatest investment she ever made for me. I've read it ten times subsequently, still discovering new subtleties in the narrative, still crying in shock and bewilderment even after all this time. For the love of god, if you have any respect for the book, don't watch the film. Also, read another of Zusack's books, I Am The Messenger (I think it's The Messenger in the US?), Another marvellous, albeit under-appreciated book.	has to be something pratchett. i've read thousands of books. i've read books outside my genre, books without covers, just because it was a book. i was reading wilde when i was 8. i can read shakespeare without the help of the ~~sidenotes~~ translations, faster than most could read sidney sheldon. i think wodehouse is one of the best authors the world has ever seen. and pratchett makes them all look like children. terry pratchett was a better writer than william shakespeare could ever have dreamed of being. pratchett was the best writer we've ever had; this is not only my opinion, but i'm sure i was saying it first. read his shit.	1
I had a friend who died saving someone else. What selfless thing have you seen/heard about that inspired you?	I am just gonna be that guy. Jesus died to save mankind from sin. He was whipped, beaten, humiliated and left to die hanging on a cross.	Pierlucio Tinazzi. There was a horrendous fire in the Mont Blanc tunnel in 1999, so bad that the emergency services had given up all hope. At that point Pierlucio put on some breathing equipment, hopped on his motorcycle and rode into the flaming tunnel. He saved 10 people, and died as he dragged a truck driver to safety. Not only is he incredibly heroic, he gets style points for riding in to save the day on a motorcycle.	0
[Serious] Happy spouses of Reddit, why is marriage so awesome?	She's pretty, smart, smells good, says funny things, goes places with me, watches horror movies with me, lets me lick her butthole, likes the same music, has a stupid southern accent that sounds adorable, honestly I can't figure out why I'd ever want to be with anyone else.	everyone has said this, but it's 100% true my husband is my best friend. He completes me! we work opposite schedules but still do things for one another to show our love like he leaves me notes every morning to wake up too before he leaves for work or before i leave i make him a delicious dinner so he doesn't have to worry about making anything for himself or kids. I truly enjoy every moment i get with him even if it's a couple minutes when he gets home and i have to leave for work.	1
I am a social outcast and I don't want to be. I want to have something to look forward to in the day. How do I make and keep friends?	I went a year where I had to survive by making friends quickly in new situations and then move and keep the old friends. Here's a good failsafe, "listen a lot, don't say much, and be the person who never worries, never causes problems, and likes to clean dishes." Everyone needs someone like that, a calming, clean influence that does the dishes.	best thing to do is get off reddit and social media these are SAP generators and the worst thing for you	1
You get 1 million dollars every month for the next 5 years, but once a month for 24 hours you become the worlds most wanted person. You get a 3 hour notice before the 24 hours starts, would you do it and how would you avoid being caught?	Find a small town sheriff with money problems and pay him to "arrest" me once a month and book me under the name Otis Campbell. From there on out, I would just be Otis the town drunk. And once a month, I'd just get shit faced, walk into jail, get myself arrested, and sleep it off. And while the rest of the world is on a manhunt for RikerOmega3, I'd actually already be in custody...which is the last place they would ever look	I affiliate to the republican party. maybe with some luck, I can win a special election in Montana or become President of the United States...	1
[Serious] Redditors from India - Is caste system considered a thing of the past among young people?	Its very much alive and Indians still hold it close to them. Its not a very bug deal to some of the middle class youth from the big cities but they are less than a tiny insignificant minority. The country still votes largely based on religious and community/caste lines. Edit: I have nothing against the caste system and don't see why it should be banned. What's a major fuck up is all the discrimination that's based on this caste system. Remove it and people will still discriminate.	The young people here do think that it's a thing of the past, but it's the older and educated ones that don't and become a scar for the unity of our country. Many of the older people, especially if they're not very educated, will totally convince the children to stay away from people/kids that are from an 'earlier lower cast'. That's fortunately a rare sight, but it's mildly existing.	0
I just got kicked out of a final test for laughing. What are some funny reasons you have been kicked out of class for?	In high school I was playing with a large floppy metal ruler while watching a movie during class. idk why, but i bent it over my head and let it go so it would spring up in to the air. When it did it was during a suspenseful part of the movie and made a crazy loud noise as it flapped in the air, which caused everyone in the room to gasp and some even screamed. My friend sitting next to me got a referral for being "a bad influence" on me. Seriously.	Didn't get kicked out, but lost it while taking a history test back in high school, at a corny joke the teacher wrote into the test. The question was "How did the Mennonites support themselves in Canada?" and one of the options was selling the Encyclopedia Britannia door to door. Teacher probably liked that his joke made someone laugh. I did have to leave the test halfway though, because my nose suddenly started bleeding.	1
Who's related to a pornstar? Also, who's accidentally recognized a relative in porn?	I found a girl in a video that looked like a close friend of mine. I knew it wasn't her but it looked A LOT like her. So much that I actually had to show her and a few of our friends as a joke at a party. I load it up and she gets kind of white looking. It's her cousin. We still laugh and joke* about inviting the cousin to parties from now on. *By joke I mean I want her to come to parties from now on. ^seriously	There was a guy on Reddit a few weeks ago who's aunt was in a photo series making out with a woman while making cupcakes or something.	1
What is the "most likely to succeed" student from your class doing now? What is the actual most successful person from your class doing?	I'm only 20 so I think he's still in college. But I'm making $2000 a week self employed and am heavily involved in the stock market and just started in real estate across 4 states. Who's successful now, John? You were always such a dick.	Mine went to the University of Maryland, and then actually played for the NBA for a few years, and now (about 20 years later) he's coaching the Orlando Magic. I think he still spends most of his time being unusually tall. We've got some doctors and lawyers and such (including myself), but he's probably still actually the most successful person, at least financially speaking, even if he's just living off of interest on what he made in his early 20s. On the bright side, he was a really decent, hardworking guy and never seemed to let any of it get to his head at all, so I don't begrudge him a bit of it.	0
What was the “little crime” you committed as a kid?	Home alone and I was throwing a tennis ball inside the house and broke a window. So I grabbed a rock and all the glass pieces outside, scattered the glass inside with the rock in the middle of the mess, and went over to my friends house until it was well into the evening. When I came back home my mom says "Can you believe someone threw a rock through our window?"	Me and my neighbor friend did a bad thing, not me but he, he took a big rock and throw it on a 2-3 year old kid which was our neighbor too then he hide in our house then exposed, that poor kid	1
Impulse buyers of reddit, what's the most regrettable purchase you or somebody you know has made?	I went to the local Sea Doo dealer for a $80.00 throttle cable for an old Sea Doo. I left with a new $12000.00 Sea Doo. Im still paying for that one. But it is fun....	A steel tongue drum for about 300€. It got me hooked on that kind of music and now I have several drums, beaters, and no one else gets it!	1
People who have said fuck it and packed your bags to start a new life elsewhere, what was your experience like? What unexpected challenges did you face and have to overcome?	I packed my bag and got to the door and realized I don’t even live at this place. The bag I just packed wasn’t even my bag, nothing in it was mine either. Just all the clothes and essentials of some random person living there. What a day.	I did this and it worked out fine. An unexpected challenge was getting used to different store options, different food options, somewhat different road system, etc. I don’t think it matters what you choose to do so long as you make it the right decision.	0
Cheaters of reddit, why you are currently cheating on your SO?	This thread is hard to read when you're in an LDR. A lot of replies seem to be because of being apart for too long. Distance man...	I am going to get downvoted, but I don't fucking care. You know what? I don't like judging people, but if you cheat on your SO, especially if you are married, FUCK YOU! SERIOUSLY, JUST GO FUCK YOURSELF! Its really disheartening when this involves other people who are innocent victims and especially when there are so many, so many valid, and eligible people to 'fuck'. Please, if you are going to do something stupid like this, I hope you would take the small decency of making sure the other person doesn't have a SO either. You are SERIOUSLY fucking up their lives.	1
About a week ago, I learned that drinking water before you go to bed will help you wake up early, and it's worked marvelously. What other things has reddit taught you?	I recently read that the primary purpose of flossing isn't actually to get food out of your tooth gaps, but to strengthen your gums and disrupt bacteria growth. The dentist always mentioned how important flossing was but they NEVER told me why. I used to not be motivated to floss all the time because nothing would come out from between my teeth, but after I read that I've started flossing once a day. My gums would occasionally bleed when I brushed really hard or on the rare occasion that I decided to floss, but now it doesn't really happen any more.	Stop being a grumpy twat. There are people out there in worse position than you are. Learn to love life.	1
What's the nicest thing you've done for someone that they never found out about?	A co-worker made a major, costly mistake. They were an otherwise great employee, but the company was making cuts and looking for reasons to fire people. I was considered indispensable due to my position and particular skills. So I took the fall for her, figuring it would cost me nothing and probably save her job. I was right on both counts. I never told her, because she was the type of person who wouldn't have allowed anyone to lie for her.	I once took a $20 note from my grandpa's pocket in the night, with the lights out.. thought it was $10.... Found it out the next day and put back... Haha..	1
What's your favorite conversation starter?	"You alright mate?" "Yeah man, you?" "I'm good thanks" "...So, what you been up to?" "Not much, you?" "Neither..." Such is life in the UK	Me: How much does a polar bear weigh? New friend: Um, I don't know. How much? Me: I don't know either but it's enough to break the ice.	1
Whats your moment of point of no return on a date?	I don't really believe in dating or a committed relationship for that matter. On the off chance that a girl invites me out or what ever you will call it. The point of no return for me is when they let me do ANYTHING, nothing is a larger turn off than some one who is willing to look the other way.	Upon wondering where my way too drunk date had wandered off too, I asked the doorman of the bar we were at if she had walked by. That is when I saw her blowing the ex boyfriend. They were standing in the middle of the parking lot. Guess they weren't that *ex*	0
Fast food workers, what's the weirdest order you ever received?	When I worked at Tim Hortons a guy used to come in and order a tuna salad sandwich on a toasted until burnt blueberry bagel with honey mustard. He came in weekly for this sandwich.	I worked at A&W for a year. One night around close it's just me and the assistant manager because it was a slow night in a small town. I had a reasonably attractive older woman come in and ask for a Chubby Chicken Sandwich, pretty much a McChicken. But she wanted me to fuck the sandwich. I guess not so much fuck it as put my dick in between the chicken patty and the bun for a few seconds.	1
You have the chance to own any fictional item, what do you take?	Marauder's map. A lot of the things being said would totally be taken for studying or whatever random reasons but the map wouldn't be and I'll tell you why. Because you know where everyone is! You could be the best criminal in the world and even if the cops knew it was you they would still not be able to get you if you know where EVERYONE is. Or you could be a bad ass hero that can find any missing person ever.	Genies lamp from Aladdin. Use the first two wishes to get literally whatever I want and free him with the third because he's Robin Williams.	0
What's your favorite way to "break the ice"?	I usually talk about why they are at the place we are at. Party: "Who do you know here?" Convention: "What kind of games do you play?" Bathroom: "Wow, that's a big dick, can I touch it?" Prison: "What did *you* do to get here?" Solitary Confinement: "Get me out of this room."	I prefer to use a 450 kiloton nuclear warhead to break my ice. May not be the most cost effective way, but nuclear detonations are pretty fun.	1
What opinion do you have that you'd never say aloud?	Everybody else's opinions are so serious... I was gonna say that people pay too much for new bicycles. That most people only ride them a day or two. That's all.	Stop having kids. We don't need anymore. Seriously, you're being incredibly selfish by continuing to increase the burdens on our planet because you wan't a poop machine. Take care of the people that are here.	1
What lie have you been told that has been part of the greatest disappointment when you found the truth?	That I'm such a cute girl, and that i'll be able to get any boy I want. **BULLSHIT**! It took me 18 years to get a boyfriend.	My childhood dog didn't go to the farm. I didn't figure it out until my mid thirties when I was telling my wife about him. The second I told her, "he went to live on a... DAMMIT!"	0
Reddit, do you have any personal conspiracy theories that you believe in?	OK...short list: 9/11 was an inside job. I've seen all the documentaries pro/con and the evidence is overwhelming. Buildings don't collapse like that unless they are deliberately imploded. Period. And just how the fuck did building 7 go down when it's 2 blocks away and buildiings between it and the twin towers weren't damaged?	I'm convinced my friends invented a person just to mess with me. Every now and then I catch them talking about this "person" who was supposedly in school with us, and they all talk about her like she exists. They talk about good times they had, and insist I've probably met her. I've expressed my doubt, but every time they insist she is working at the local Starbucks we find out she is "off for the day". This "person" has a facebook and sometimes comments on my friend's posts and such, and even pretended to not understand when I congratulated them for their dedication on her wall. I'm pretty sure they'll hire an actress to try to finally convince me of her existence, and then mock me for falling for the longest prank in history.	0
Americans, what do you actually think of Canadians?	Boring and insecure so they brag about how amazing their country is all the time to stay relevant because nobody is actually thinking about them ever	In general, I don't. They're like the neighbors next door that you never see, and when you happen to, they always wave back.	0
What are some places no one should EVER visit in their lifetime?	North Sentinel Island in the Bay of Bengal. Everyone who attempted either got murdered or critically injured by an indigenous tribe who refuses access to outsiders.	Downtown Detroit is a pretty good candidate for 'never tour there, ever.' EDIT: Okay, okay, I get it, downtown isn't that bad. I'm referring to like, the outskirts that aren't quite the suburbs but not really downtown anymore where everything's abandoned or dilapidated.	1
What’s the Laziest you have ever been?	Severe hangover. Need caffeine. Nothing in house. Not going to store. Ordered a pizza to get big bottle of cola.	i once pissed the bed because i was too comfortable to get up and use the toilet. i laid there for a couple of minutes, then got up and proceeded to change my clothes, sheets, clean up, shower, etc.	1
What 'old people' thing do your parents do which drives you crazy?	My dad does the old person tech support thing, but he ARGUES with me about it. I have to re-teach this guy how to use email attachments three times a month and he wants to tell me how I should be updating the drivers on his janky-ass laptop, because god forbid he ever for one second not be the highest authority on all forms of knowledge. I've instituted a rule that I won't so much as touch his computer unless he leaves the room first. Also the thing where he keeps telling my kid brother to apply for jobs by turning up in person with a paper copy of his resume and refusing to leave until he can give it to a manager.	my dad still *smokes* his pot, like some kind of caveman. i mean, come on dad, you should be vaping that shit. he also still smokes cigarettes even though he nearly died of a stroke last year and damnit old man, i quit smoking so can you.	1
What was your most awkward experience with a doctor?	Before getting radiation treatment on my groin, the doctor told me I shouldn't have unprotected sex for 6 months. I said, "Got it. No X-Men babies." He did that thing where he looked over the top of his glasses to show he was not amused.	One time a doctor put a finger in my put, so I fisted him for a good 20-30 minutes to assert my dominance. Anyway, now I'm in prison. Edit: A word	1
What's something you did as a child that you never grew out of?	Eat a plate of food one thing at a time. Start with the vegetables. Want to have a bite of chicken halfway through? Nope, gotta finish that broccoli. I still always go in order from least to most appealing.	Read Calvin and Hobbes. I read them growing up and now I am able to read them and get something new out of them	1
HELP! I was in a car accident with a cop during the snowy weekend. It was 100% his fault and now they're flipping it on me. What the fuck do I do?	IF you win, move... The cop and his 'brothers' will make it hell for you. Tickets for the littlest things e.g. driving 2 miles over the speed limit. You know when you signal for a left turn and before you finish the turn your signal cuts off, ticket. Park too close to another car/curb, Ticket. Forget to signal when pulling off the curb, ticket. If you lose, they may 'watch' you for a bit, but at least the 'hassle' will go away when they 'find someone else'	I am an auto accident liability adjuster and I can tell you right now, based on the facts of the accident you posted, you would be considered to be majority at fault. With some comparative or contributory negligence on the police officer for unsafe speed for conditions. But failure to yield is correct. This is how any insurance company will see it.	0
Lawyer's of reddit, what is the most fucked up case you ever took?	So since this thread currently lacks serious answers, I have one for you. A friend of mine was a lawyer for a major hospital, and not only quit but changed fields because of a malpractice case brought against said hospital. Long story short, through gross negligence a six year old girl was accidentally infected with HIV while receiving bloodwork. The family was (understandably) suing the hospital, and my friend was on the defense team charged with proving in court why the hospital didn't need to pay the family any damages, and why said family was still on the hook for paying their medical bills to said hospital.	I mainly specialize in birdlaw, so I've seen some crazy things. However, the craziest lawyer thing I've done was defend an actual cat. You might be surprised to hear that it didn't go purrfectly. Still, I walked out knowing that it was gonna be a long day for the rats.	1
What's one little-known fact you wish the public knew about the industry/company you work for?	I work for a major car company. A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60 mph. The rear differential locks up. The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside. Now, should we initiate a recall? Take the number of vehicles in the field, A, multiply by the probable rate of failure, B, multiply by the average out-of-court settlement, C. A times B times C equals X. If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one. You wouldn't believe the amount of these kinds of accidents.	I work at a jewelry store. Everything is usually marked up 400%. You can haggle down to 1/4th the price of what is listed usually.	0
What is the most stupidly dangerous thing you've ever done?	not an exciting thing but in a chem lab we were doing a prac and I had a beaker of water, a beaker of salt water, and a beaker of caustic soda. I'm a sloppy piece of shit that doesn't label beakers but I thought I had a decent memory. So when I had to get the beaker if water I was 80% sure it was water but to be 100% sure I test it the quickest but most reckless way: I take a sip. Immediately I spit it into the sink, that was the salt water instead. In retrospect I'm very lucky it wasn't the NaOH TL;DR I don't label chemicals and I had three clear beakers so I drink the one I think is water but its not. Happy it didn't burn my tongue	I was climbing down Guadalupe Peak (highest point in Texas), got impatient, and started sliding down the side of the mountain instead of going back and forth along the switchbacks. I'd slide down about 20 feet, land on the trail, slide, land on the trail, etc. Then I slid and the trail wasn't there. Below me was a 200 foot drop and I was still sliding. I turned onto my stomach and clawed at the ground but couldn't get a grip and kept sliding. About eight feet from dropping off the cliff, my right hand grabbed a little tree that I hadn't even seen. I spent the next hour moving back up the side of the mountain inch by inch, wasting all the time I'd saved with my "shortcut". tl;dr: Slid down a mountain because I was lazy, nearly fell off the mountain.	0
What was your first "Shit just got real" moment where you thought you might actually die?	I had autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, and was thinking how nice it was that everyone was visiting me in ICU, even relatives I'd not seen for years. Then I realised they were all coming because there was a high chance of me checking out.	During a mosh pit at a Kanye concert a few weeks ago. For reference, I'm 5'1 and 115 pounds. Somehow, (this was a festival, so no assigned seats) I ended up surrounded by some large guys. When Part 2 came on and Panda started blaring, EVERYONE surged forward and I came close to being trampled a few times. And don't even get me started on what it felt like to be in there during Ni**as in Paris. Chaos. I genuinely thought I was going to die. In fact, after we got out, some stranger who had been holding on to me found me again just to say "I'm pretty sure I saved your life a couple of times back there." If he hadn't been holding on I would have absolutely been hurt. Thanks nice Kanye fan.	1
What's the stupidest movie twist you've ever seen?	Side note: Ron Howard tells a story about reading the audience reaction cards after test screenings of Apollo 13. Most feedback was positive but one card was extremely negative. On the back of the card was scrawled the following message, "total Hollywood bullshit, tacking that ending on. NO WAY would they have survived in real life"	The Prestige. Though it was a pretty entertaining movie, it turns out a machine that can clone people exists and the only relevant thing that's done with its' technology is perform magic shows.	1
I told a friend last night thats kids these days are soft and spoiled. She got very upset. Reddit do you agree with me? If not, why?	every generation says that about the younger one, but not every parent is raising their kids the same way. There are plenty of shitty parents out there, but I know plenty who are raising their kids to be well adjusted responsible people.	I agree. It's ridiculous. When i was a kid we played outside,not with our iphones. I've seen an 8 year old with a cell phone. A lot of teenagers are disrespectful and mean. I cannot stand what our youth has come to. *edit* fixed spelling so lo_an_behold will stop freaking out!	1
What is something you hate that so many film makers seem to do?	Cast Jessie Eisenberg. Dunno what it is about that dude. I just can't take to him. Decent actor but fills me with rage.	I hate how much clipping there is in fight scenes, chase scenes, etc. I guess I don't know the technical terms, but I hate how chopped up everything is. Constantly changing angles and distances. It's just disorienting to be teleported all over the place and then suddenly you're, say, watching the protagonist fall out of a window but you didn't even realize he/she was anywhere near a window. EDIT: Thanks for all the recommendations & explanations, everyone! I've got a big list of things to watch now! Here's hoping some new directors will hear our pleas in the future!	0
What is a question a child has asked you that you just don't have the answer to?	Im a teacher and i never have good answers when kids ask about dress codes. I just enoforce them because im supposed to but i really dont care about what theyre wearing	I'm not good with kids. I used to work in this restaurant where the chef's wife would stop by some afternoons and bring their daughter. Not 100% on daughter's age, but not yet in primary school. Anyway, the daughter takes a shine to me, and to my amazement, I actually manage to engage with a child. For the first time. Mother says "Oh, you're good with kids. Why don't you hang out with [DAUGHTER] while I go talk to [HUSBAND]?" She leaves. First thing out of the kid's mouth: "Why do dogs have to die?" "... Uhhhh"	0
[Serious] Teenagers of Reddit, what concerns are you facing currently? What concerns you about your future?	My biggest concerns as of now come from starting college. Whether I'll adjust okay (both socially and academically) or if I'm choosing the right major (biological engineering). It's insane making such huge decisions when I'm not even legally an adult. And my parents are putting such a huge emphasis on working hard during this part of my life so I can be successful later. It makes me feel like if I screw up right now, I can potentially ruin the rest of my life.	I'm fifteen, checking in. My main concern at the moment is that I may not graduate. I'm a junior and haven't taken Driver's Education, and it's a dumb graduation requirement at my school that you have to. I wasn't old enough to take it during freshman and sophomore when I was in gym and the only offer it during gym. Gym doesn't really fit into my schedule and I don't want to take it because it will lower my weighted GPA. Currently also stressing about the ACT because I'm taking it for the first time in a month and my mom won't let me take it again. Finally, just generally concerned about maintaining my 4.0 GPA.	1
What's your favourite quote from a song?

But the fighter still remains."	0
What is the most memorable event that happened during a game of truth or dare?	When I was 17, I had a small gathering when parents went out for weekend. I invited them over and we played. It was Fall so it was cold. We were next to fire pit and playing when I was asked by my hit friend to strip down naked and jump in pool. Coincidentaly I did it. I don't concern nudity with sexuality so it's easy. Coincidentally my turn was next I then asked her to join me. She did. We had sex later that night and now together. We are 23 and she loves to tell that fucking story.	16 year old me was playing truth or dare with some other high schoolers at a party and this one girl asked for truth. My buddy Damon asked "do you have nipple rings?" She laughed and said yes, but Damon wasn't buying it. He asked her to prove it and he was pretty persistent. She ended up showing us her boobs, and that was the first time I had ever seen boobs in person before.	0
Reddit,what's your fetish which your SO doesn't know about?	Rape. (watching her get raped, Me going for others) Beastality. ( I want to watch her submit to a dog) Paedophilia. ( I like to date young looking girls/ get turned on by girls around ages 11+, but I would never act on it) Gangbangs (I want to watch her be in one, consensual or not)	Short girls like 4'11" - 5'3" she doesn't know because she is 5'10" and I don't want her to think anything.	0
What is the scariest experience you've ever had while home alone?	I find being home alone very scary as I have tons of suicidal thoughts. Sitting in the dark at 5am with a bottle of pills and a glass of water in your hands is indeed very scary. A couple of weeks before, I got into a really bad stage where I decided to call a suicide line but a machine picked up and put me on hold. At that point I had the pills in my mouth, wishing someone would just call me or burst in the door, stopping me. Well obviously I didn't go through with it. I hate being home alone. TL;DR Home alone when you are suicidal is some scary shit.	I was 11 or so and my parents were out to a company dinner it was around 8 pm when a fighter jet broke the sound barrier(against regulation) and the sonic boom knocked pictures off my wall. Bout shit my self.	0
What was the worst "why the f*** did I say that" moment?	In 8th grade, there was this pretty girl that I sat next to who had a reputation for being depressed and sleeping around. In retrospect, she probably had a lot of emotional issues from her upbringing. One day, she asked me, “What would you do if I died?” The first that came to mind was: “I’d probably use your desk to put my books on”	One time in high school, there was this girl I had dated in the past who was starting to drink alchohol and hang out with people I wasn’t a big fan of. One day while in the halls of our school she described an instance where she had embarrassed herself in front of a large crowd of people recently, and I muttered under my breath that she, “was probably drunk”. Needless to say, there were some people upset at me that day	1
What is the biggest act of passive aggressiveness you've ever witnessed or done?	Me: "I can do this for you but you're behind on your invoices, you really need to get caught up." Client: "How much do we owe you?" Me: "Including this last job, it's <amount>." Client: "Okay, I am confident we can get that to you by the end of next week." <three weeks later> Me: "Hello, just following up to see where we are on that payment." Client: <no response> <two weeks later> Client: "Hey, our site is down. Can you get it back up for us?" Me: "I am confident I can get it back up by the end of next week."	Back during my degree I was doing an essay about typographical trends. My lecturer and I had a disagreement about something to do with another project, something about a display or something I don't quite recall. I handed the essay on time but with each word successively in Arial, Helvetica and Gill Sans. Drove. Him. Nuts.	1
Driving instructors of reddit, what is the worst thing a student has attempted to do or has done during a lesson?	I was in the car for observation hours, the Kid driving didn't understand that flooring the gas then slamming the breaks isn't a good Idea at every intersection.	Probably what the a1 asshole did on my way I this morning. Stop in the left lane on a 3 way highway and cut 70 mph traffic off to get over to the right. Blows my mind the idiots who have a license.	1
What's the creepiest thing you've seen your pet do ?	I once woke up in the middle of the night and saw a large black figure standing over me. I was freaked the fuck out and yelled at it, only to see the shape of ears perk up on this figure and it jumped up onto my bed. Turns out to be my dog, who had been standing on the ground with his paws on the bed, standing over me and watching me sleep.	My Serinus canaria domestica once recited the de Broglie relation. *Or was it the inverse Compton effect?* I am assuming many SCD do that, there are just not enough people that know such formulae.	1
Last night, a man screamed "I hope you get raped" at me because he thought I didn't pick up dog poop in my own front yard. What's the most wildly inappropriate thing a stranger has ever yelled at you reddit?	"I'll have your job for this and see that you never work again!" A man screamed that at me when I told him our town recycling center was closed for the day and I would not unlock the gate. The recycling center was staffed by volunteers. (I'm a college professor.)	well this one time some fucking bitch didn't pick up her dogs shit so i yelled "i hope you get raped" because she deserves to be	1
Pet owners of Reddit: what is something seemingly caring and adorable that your pet does to you or for you, but screws you over a little?	My dog (a corgi) loves to make new friends with people. She loves to be cuddled and picked up and held like a baby. It's cute as hell. And that's a problem... She doesn't understand that she is an EXPENSIVE dog and she'll let anyone take her home.	He lays on my bed when I'm gone. He does it because he likes my scent, but he sheds like no other.	0
Bodygaurds and Butlers of Reddit, Whats the most interesting thing you've witnessed?	Hey! Butler and professional internet liar here (When I'm not at my bodyguard job). I'd say the craziest thing is seeing big foot find 8 four leaf clovers in a span of 10 minutes in the middle of January, in Antarctica.	Not totally related, but a fun story nonetheless. My dad worked in dignitary protection in the late 80s/early 90s. One person he had to escort around was Nelson Mandela. On a long private flight with Mandela (maybe 12 passengers on board) a pork chop dinner was served. Unfortunately, the crew only brought enough meals for everyone to have one serving. Unknowingly, Mandela asked for seconds before my dad had a chance to eat, so my Dad had to starve on this eight-hour flight. When news broke that Mandela died in 2013, my dad texted me something along the lines of "That pork chop-stealing SOB finally got what was coming to him!"	0
What is your favourite riddle?	When you need me you throw me away. When you don't need me you bring me back. What am I?	How did i read your mind? Think of a number between 1 & 10, Double it, Add 6, Divide by 2, Minus your original number... You are thinking of 3.	1
What was the dumbest rule your school enforced?	Conservative Christian College. A group of us played Age of Empires one weekend. They didn’t like it and called a meeting. Everyone involved got misdemeanors on their records. There was nothing in the handbook about it being against the rules. The only person that didn’t get any punishment was the son of the president even though he was just as involved as the rest of us. Was quite interesting explaining the write up on my record when I transferred. “You got a misdemeanor for what?!” Edit they made it a rule after the fact and did this several other times with things such as nail polish or radio control helicopters.	Still a rule: girls can't wear tank tops. Literally no girl ever in class screams and cries because there a boy looking at her tits. Most girls in 8th grade don't even have tits and are flat. I'm a heavy chested girl and idc. I mean I know its gonna happen its not like they are taking pics of them and jacking off. I just like being comfortable in the summer damn.	1
People who dealt weed in CO, WA, OR and AK as a source of income, what do you do now that weed is legal?	I'm in high school and most kids just get them from dealers since they're still cheaper, while its the parents that go to the dispensaries. Quite interesting.	From what I hear it is still cheaper to go to a dealer so I think people for now are still going to their dealers.	0
What is the most ridiculous thing you have heard a teacher say?	If I bowed my head and closed my eyes I could telepathically communicate with a 2000 year old Jewish zombie.	Once, my teacher insisted that I was mispronouncing my name, and threatened to send me to the principal's office when I argued with her. It wasn't a fun year.	0
What subreddit is your secret pleasure?	I will probably get downvoted... I miss /r/fatpeoplehate. I don't understand why it got banned but others didn't. I am not a hateful person by any means but just seeing the level of hate and misdirected anger made me feel better knowing I wasn't as angry about things as I thought. It put things into perspective and made me be more relaxed and less worry some.	/r/deadbedrooms and /r/relationships. I don't really post there but I love reading about peoples problems, so I can be like "damn." Kind of makes me sound like a dick but I genuinely care, I just can't offer the same quality advice others are offering unless it specifically pertains to something I have experience with. I literally browse those subreddits until I fall asleep and in the morning, looking for updates, seeing what's up. EDIT: Welp, didn't know so many nosy bitches frequented reddit. Nice to meet you all!	0
What occupation do you have immense respect for?	The clean-up crew who come along to accidents/murders/suicides/the whole shebang. It's a horrible job, but someone has to do it and those people get my utmost respect. Edit: You know what? Make that all cleaners. You guys are so under-appreciated. But we see you. We see you, and we thank you for what you do.	Parking Enforcement Officers They're the only occupation without their very own Reddit circlejerk. Plus most folks still call 'em 'meter maids'. WTF? Is it still the '60s, where we have stewardesses?	1
What is your craziest school story?	One time in high school, the normal school nurse had to take the day off, so they called my mom to sub for her. Well I answered the phone and told them she'd do it. I put all my mom's nurse stuff on and put two lopsided balloons in my chest and a black wig I had from Halloween, and I went in as the nurse sub. Well like halfway through the day, some kid came in and pulled his pants down...he said he had a pulled muscle or some shit. He had the tiniest penis ever and he was all nervous and had a tiny little boner. I jerked him off. It was hilarious.	We had a very sexy teacher in high school who got caught banging half the cheerleading squad. He had just had a baby and his wife divorced him, he lost his job, then did some time.	0
What’s the worst public break up you’ve witnessed?	My ex curving me in front of all my friends and my teacher after me saying “Yeah she’s my girlfriend, o b s e r v e”	Two teens broke up in the middle of one of the busiest malls in the area. The guy gave her a rose and then broke up with her infront of a mall full of people. Then he proceeded to hug her while she cried and begged him not to.	0
My father made me hold my hand over one of my eyes after I threw a fork at my brother when I was 6 to see what it'd have been like for him if I'd blinded him. Reddit, what are some interesting disciplining methods your parents have done to you?	My abusive mother used to throw household items at me in anger and call me degrading names for being stupid despite the fact that I was struggling with a learning disability and pregnant with my second child that my father impregnated me with back when I was a teenage black girl. My only source for inspiration was in Lenny Kravitz, Mariah Carey, and keeping myself busy with hilarious fried chicken dine-&-dashes. These are the hurdles that made me the man I am today though.	One time I was picking on my little brother (because I was a dick when I was 12), and I punched him square in the chest. He dropped right there, wind knocked out of him. I turned around to leave his room, and who should be in the doorway, but my dad. He drilled me right in the chest...I dropped...wind knocked out of me. All I could hear was my brother laughing at me between gasps for air. My dad looked down at me and said, "Theres always someone bigger than you, remember that". Thats the only time my dad ever hit me, and I never laid another hand on my brother. Not really "interesting" per se...but effective.	0
What dark secrets do popular subreddits have in their past?	Wasnt there a programming sub where one of the mods was found out to be a pedophile with child porn on their computer?	How about their present? There are at least two subreddits (one of them a default about a certain form of entertainment, the other is about an important subject but no longer a default) who are being accused of having at least some mods colluding with PR agencies/organizations and enterprises to 1)hype certain things 2)hype certain people 3)hype certain causes and 4)hide everything that goes against that narrative. Investigations are probably underway.	1
Non-Europeans, what is something about European culture that makes you laugh?	Embracing royalty. I get it that it's nice to play in medieval times, but actually having a king/queen/prince/ss, giving them a better treatment and tax money is fucked up.	Maybe not laugh, but I would say the "Ultra" subcultures of football fans. Stereotypical soccer fans in America could not be any more different.	0
Today I gave a $10 tip to a Pizza delivery man, he broke down in tears and gave me a hug while thanking me for being the first person in a "very long time" to be nice to him. What have you involuntarily done to make someone cry of joy?	I was with my siblings at the lake in Zurich. We had some leftover sandwiches with us, and they were tearing the bread apart and tossing it to the ducks. This tiny, frail-looking old lady walked up to my brother and said something to him. We didn't understand her, but he thought she wanted to feed the ducks too, so he gave her a bit of bread. She sat at a bench and gnawed at it. I quickly checked my wallet, only had a 50 franc note, figured she definitely needed it more than I did, if she was asking for bits of stale bread at the lake, and handed it to her. I hate being touched, especially by people I don't know, but I think that's the first time a hug from a stranger made me feel all fuzzy inside.	today i cut my friends hair into a heinously nasty mullet thing, as hes going for a full buzz cut tomorrow and wanted motivation to get it done. However the part where i actually do something nice is that i successfully stopped myself from trimming a swastika in his hair.	1
My brother drunkenly confessed that he’s in love with me and we’re not real siblings. How do I face him now…?	You seem to be worried that its you who may be adopted, isn't it more likely your brother is adopted? it would explain why he would know and you dont. A couple (your parents) are more likely to adopt when they dont have any children of their own, which would make sense if he is older than you. But think sensibly, have you seen baby/pregnancy photos of you or your brother?	Story seems more like an attempt by OP to make it an erotic story .. Not believing this at all	1
Reddit, what is the one thing you'd like to tell the opposite sex about your gender?	Just because a guy doesn't complain about his problems to you doesn't mean he's hiding anything. It also doesn't mean he doesn't have any	ladies...guys are * easy to figure out * enjoy blowjobs * mean what they say * no hidden agendas * don't want to talk * want you to trust them	1
If Reddit was a political party, what would it's policies be?	not only would you be able to vote for your favorite presidential candidate, you would also be able to downvote the person you hate.	Racism seems to come out a lot here and a forum for conspiracy theories, so I would say they would be part of the far left Democratic Party.	1
What historical character is often potrayed in two lights?	Alexander the Great. Great leader who won every battle and encouraged mixing cultures in his empire. Drunk and burnt a city and was alcoholic.	Obama, in recent history: - Cut unemployment from 10% - 4.7% - Ended Iraq - Supported and saw through LGBT marriage equality in all 50 states. - Repealed Don't Ask, Don't Tell And a few other accomplishments. But everything else is still his fault.	1
What "flaw" do you love about yourself?	I have trouble identifying specific feelings. As a result, there's a lot of deep musings between an event and a reaction, but I can articulate better than most and my writing has improved.	I trust more or less *everybody*, sometimes to the point of borderline naivete; if I know you even a bit, or you know someone I know, I think the best of you. And I've been wrong; I've been lied to, stolen from, cheated and betrayed. But *not often*. And in the end, I'd rather be a guy who loves and trusts people, and is occasionally wrong, than a guy who distrusts and fears people, and is occasionally right.	0
What makes someone *actually* look cool?	I was meeting this girls parents for the first time, on the way to the restaurant I stopped put on my emergency lights, the guy behind me honked and I flipped him off got out in the rain and gave this homeless guy my coat and umbrella. Never got a good look at the guy who was in his car, her dad gave me shit all night about not wearing a coat and not having an umbrella. Had no idea until later that night they were the ones behind me who honked. Never in my life has a family instantly approved of me like that.	The image of being effortless. Whether or not what they’re doing is actually effortless (it’s almost never effortless), other people perceiving it as effortless is what makes a person cool. Whether it be social skills, fashion, sports, music, academics, any hobby, if a person makes it seem like they just do it rather than stressing over it, they look cool. I’m not sure if this is actually a good thing, but it’s true.	0
What's the fastest you have seen someone destroy their life?	I didn't see it, but I read it on the news years ago. A bunch of fifteen years old kids were at a train station. One bets the other 50 Argentine pesos on climbing on top of the stationary train. That was a rail line which had the electric wire on top of the train. Guy climbs atop the train, doesn't touch the wire, but the proximity alone triggers a voltaic arc and burns him. He died a few days later in a hospital.	~~Thankfully, I'm too young...~~ First day of first year in high school, a student in my year was caught carrying a jar of drugs (I think he dropped it in the middle of campus).	1
Why do smokers find it acceptable to throw cigarettes all over the ground when they normally wouldn't litter in other situations?	Convenience. People have limits on their convenience. I try to go out of my way to park near a cart corral at the store so I don't have to walk one all the way back to the store or all the way back to a cart corral, further inconveniencing me. So the nearer to one I can park, I'm more likely going to put it away. A lot of smokers smoke *very* regularly. They're not always near a trash can and because it's too inconvenient for them to find one, they just throw them on the ground. tl;dr - They just don't give enough of a shit.	This bothers me daily, but Years ago, I had some friends over at my house and went out to find cigarette butts all over the driveway and in the rocks. I went off on them and they pretty much said they weren't really thinking about it, apologized, and felt kind of stupid.	1
How do you get people to leave your house when they have overstayed their welcome?	Set house on fire Call police Spray water in the faces Whip the dick out and helecoptor towards them slowly gesturing toward the door. Take you pants off and tell them "right now it's Tim's private time you better leave unless you want to join in" Seriously......	"Thank you so much for coming to visit, but it's been a long day, and I need to get some sleep. Early morning tomorrow." then just walk to the door.	0
What's a conversation you've had with someone telling a story when you realize halfway through they are the asshole in the story?	I met a bubbly girl in one of my classes who seemed nice, very chatty. She was complaining about her aunt, who wanted her to stop doing something. It went something like: "My aunt doesn't understand how tough break-ups are." "So true." "It's normal to want to know what your ex is doing!" "Yeah I think a lot of people have been there." "He and I still talk." "Awh that's nice." "He keeps telling me to stay away from his new girlfriend, who he's just using to make me jealous." "Oh." "He's been playing hard to get for a year now, I'm so sick of these ups and downs." "Ok." "Our relationship was the best two weeks of my life and he keeps pretending it never happened." Turned out her aunt was telling her to stop driving past his house at night.	Did this to myself. Halfway through telling coworkers the story about my travels in a third world country, I realized maybe I shouldn't have hijacked that passenger ship. I mean, the customer service was terrible. But that doesn't really excuse piracy on the high seas.	1
What's something that isn't sexual, you do when you're alone. That you'd never tell anyone you knew that you do?	I say all of my punctuation and actions out loud*fullstop* For example*comma* if someone asked me what day it was then I would say *quotemarks*Hmmm*comma pause for thought* It's Tuesday*exclamationmark* EDIT*colon* Also*comma* I talk to myself*fullstop*	I spend most mornings cooking breakfast with no shirt and loudly singing 80's synthpop. When hot oil flares onto my exposed skin my lovely singing turns into high pitched shriek/singing.	0
[serious] Have you been involved with a cult? What was your experience?	Yes. Catholicism. Grade 1-8 I went to a Catholic school and we would pray at least 3 times a day and now I realize it was a form of brainwashing. I would talk to god in my head and feel guilty if I even thought of a bad word. It's scary to think about now. If you SOMEHOW think that catholicism isn't a cult, at least be man enough to explain why.	Currently directing a documentary about a friend of mine who grew up in a protestant fundamentalist cult. He was born into it and essentially the cult forbids technology, pop culture, books, etc. They believe everything outside of their community as evil and "of the devil." When a member chooses to leave, they are confined, shut-up, and then ex-communicated. They will never be able to see their families again. Ex-members are left homeless and alone. It's harrowing. My friend still has trouble coping with those times. Anyways, film should be out in 2015.	0
What is your dream video game?	A real pirate game. Assassin's Creed: Black Flag was only worth it for the naval gameplay, and that was only half the game. If a studio got together and actually dedicated itself to a proper pirate game? Throw together the trading and economy from Sid Meier's: Pirates!, the Captain system from Shadow of Mordor, and the gameplay from Black Flag, and I'd be throwing money at them.	An open world mmorpg based on the anime series of fairy tail The show has everything that would make a great game already: Different sorts of magic and magic users , summoners , healers etc. It has guilds dark side light side and in between. It has pets and incredibly artwork for a video game. It would really make me happy if this would be made (and made well)	1
[Serious] Parents of reddit, what did you tell yourself you'd never do, but ended up doing, and why?	My mom used to scream in my face when she got too mad and i said I wouldn't be that kind of mom. Unfortunately it happens sometimes.	That as parents we'd still make time for ourselves to do things away from being parents. This weekend is our first kid free weekend in 14 months. We slept all afternoon then watched TV in bed.	0
To the children of polyamorous relationships, what was your childhood like?	It was a little different growing up. I remember I would always have to stay in hotels with my mom as different guys came into the room every night. It was a little annoying because sometimes they weren't even the same guys. Then whenever we did go back to my dad's he would be really angry. I don't suggest it.	My dad has a few wives. I have a lot of half brothers and sisters. I don't like it one bit. He doesn't treat my mom well. I was always embarrassed about it when I reached high school. I never told anyone about it. Hope we can get out soon, away from his control. Personally I don't like the lifestyle but that is just me. I know it is corny and cheesy but I hope I find my true love/ soul mate one day. I want to have fun too.	0
What's the weirdest thing you've ever had in your mouth?	One time I was watching tv and with no thought at all licked my laptop charger that was plugged in. My mom laughed her ass off. Edit: kicked to licked	A dildo made from the mold of my own dick. My girlfriend was practicing deepthroat and I was really curious why she was still choking and coughing after a whole week of practice so I tried it: Just the tip touching my throat made me gag and tear up and I truly appreciated her going through all that for me. Oh don't worry, I said "no homo" before gagging on the dildo so I should still be straight.	0
Reddit, what is a song that affects you like no other?	Bohemian Rhapsody. I stop what I'm doing and sing and dance like a maniac, and if you don't you need to reevaluate your life.	Maggot Brain by Funkedelic. Eddie Hazel took a couple tabs of acid and was told to play the first half of the song like he just got the news that his mother had died and to play the second half as though the news was incorrect and his mother was still alive.	0
What real life events would we consider unrealistic, bad writing or plot holes if they were fictional?	A real estate developer with a long history of bankruptcies, financial chicanery and racist statements - and zero political experience - being elected president of the United States.	The entire Cold War, but especially the multiple times we almost got into a nuclear war but it was stopped at the last minute by one person.	0
What type of person do you secretly hate?	I'm not really sure how to word this. I hate when someone suddenly is into something, because their partner is. I get having influence, but when it sooo obviously faked... I hate that.	SJWs, especially tumblrinas and femi-nazis that attempt to shove their ideologies down your throat without attempting to acknowledge a counter-argument.	1
Reddit, I just graduated from high school. What are some lessons you learned the hard way in college?	for the love of god and all that is holy DO NOT BUY TEXTBOOKS FROM THE CAMPUS STORE. Look up your courses, look up what books you need, and order them off amazon for 90% less than what the racketeers at your college wouldve charged you. you can easily save 500$ or more a semester	If you go to ATO you can get as many fizzy drinks as you want, FOR FREE! And man those things are potent! Sometimes all it takes is one and you can't remember what happened for the rest of the night!	1
What injustice from your childhood are you still fuming about?	I'm 21, and recently in therapy we have uncovered a lot of evidence that I had anxiety and depression from really young. No one ever did anything, and I have a lot of emotional scars as a result.	My parents wouldn't buy me an N64 when it was still in stores, but said if I saved up my money I could buy it for myself. I saved my allowance, and when I finally had enough they refused to take me to the store to buy it.	0
After months of applying for jobs, interviewing, and not being hired anywhere else, I finally broke down and got a job at McDonalds. I start tomorrow. Employees of McDonalds, how bad is it?	What exactly is wrong with working at McDonald's? So let me get this straight. You're 19. I'm assuming you're a high school graduate, without a college degree. You have at most three years of work experience under your belt, which is the bare minimum required in the professional world. And you expect to get hired at a workplace other than retail or the food service industry? It's self-entitled people like you that makes Americans look snobby and lazy.	I work at Mcdonalds, and worked my way up to a swing manager. In all honesty, it's what you make of it. If you go in thinking its going to suck, then, it will suck. Get in there with a good attitude, ignore the drama/stupid employees, and find the nice ones and make friends. It's really like any other job. In the end, it is what *you* make of it. Good luck to you, man!	0
What event happened that changed your life forever?	That time my wife's stomach was hurting so I took her to the hospital and they took a human of of her. And it happened again two other times!	I fell hard for the most gorgeous, fun, smart, free-spirited girl, and she broke up with me after I fell in love. Every woman since then has failed to interest me for more than a few months. Basically, I cannot fall in love with anyone else. I'm pretty sure I am not comparing anyone to her, consciously or otherwise, but nothing lights the love fire. I get turned on by other women, big time, no problem, but I have no interest in "being with" anyone else. I don't want to go back to her, either. I'm fucked, I guess.	0
If we could download smells, what would be on your smell playlist?	The outside of a really good steak restaurant, where the air smells like hot fries and cooking beef. Or a carnival funnel cake stand. I'd smell it while eating gross healthy food and lose weight. Also some... um... other smells. nevermind.	I've gotten into indie perfumes so I have a lot of the scents mentioned here. I actually have a perfume that smells like maple-drizzed, chocolate covered, wood-smoked bacon. I've found a scent that smells exactly like my grandma too. Now I'm looking for a scent that smells like babies' heads..they always have that nice, milky scent.	1
Teachers or professors of Reddit, what is the most elaborate cheating scheme you've stumbled upon?	Wtf to all you idiots explaining how you cheated. YOU pay good money to go to school and LEARN. If you can't learn, just drop out, because you're ripping yourself off. I went to school with tons of cheaters. I studied and graduated at the top of my class. The whole time I would get nagged by idiots for copies of my homework etc.	University of Florida circa 1985. Once a final began the answers were posted across campus so you could grade your final and figure your grade. One fraternity had their pledges get the answers. They then used a Mr. Microphone to broadcast them to brothers via FM Walkmans.	0
[Serious] Dear depressed people of Reddit, what could make your day?	Not being fucking depressed. This is how I explain it: You are sitting at your computer. All you need to do to be happy is type. Just choose some words and put them on the screen. You know how to type, your computer is fine. There is *absolutely no reason* why you couldn't just write a couple paragraphs right now. It'd be so great if you could just type. Yet you just sit there. No words come out. You just have to put your hands *there* and *there* and move your fingers!! That's all! Yet you just sit there. You don't understand why. You try to will yourself to move, but you just sit there.	I know this doesn't help that much, but when I was quite a bit down, a smile from someone helped. Made me feel a little bit better. Just a tad. So, years ago, I made a conscious effort to smile when I would engage with someone. Just a smile. After a while, it became natural. And you know what? Not only did I feel better, people treated me better. And the smiles back helped me feel a tad bit better as well. tl:dr; smile at the next person you talk to.	1
What unusual thing do you do at home when no one is around?	I have 3 birds, I'll cook up some pasta and take them all out into the living room and set up a table and have a pasta party with the birds. They each get a plate and while they don't normally get along as long as they are eating they ignore each other. I just clean off the clumps of pasta that gets stuck on the sides of their beaks. We talk, whistle and just basically hang out. Once they finish I'll setup a few bowls of warm water and let them take separate baths. Then it's off to the cage so they can dry off and preen themselves. So far in 47 years I've never heard any one that I know or know of do this. I will say this, it's really fun and cute, makes me feel closer to them.	I'm actually alone in the house today and have been all day. I'm boring and have done nothing of interest.	1
What's your ghost story?	I live in a house in the middle of town that was the original farmhouse in the area. There's a mural in city hall that shows the area from the turn of the century (1900, not 2000), and you can see my house in it surrounded by fields. I don't have a ghost story. Not one. I wish I did.	Went to Denny at 3 am for steak I was craving. On my drive up Harlem towards Niles, I passed a cemetery and saw a ghost of a women walking slowly along rhe side of the road. Just as I was coming up beside her she disappeared. I slammed on my breaks and shockingly so did the car next to me. We both got out the car looked at each other and asked Did yoy just see that? Holy shit that was awesome! We stood there for several minutes before a Park Ridge cop pulled up behind us asking if we were alright. We told him what we saw and he calm as hell said oh yeah she does that often. But ya'll need to keep moving, your blocking the road.	0
What item seems way overpriced to you and why?	My wife. She was cheap and easy to deal with dating. Now i get a small allowance from my salary ...	I don't understand how the market hasn't lowered the price of a decent custom picture frame. I have an old vintage poster I'd like to hang up, but I took it to Cheap Pete's -- a bargain local chain here in the SF Bay Area -- and it was going to be like $500. I noped out of there.	0
Let's say you could make countless identical clones of yourself, which you would use to populate a city. Each clone has one of your personality traits, and only one. What is happening in the bad parts of town?	Lots and lots and lots of drugs. And some of me are being raped and mugged by other me and the crook me is being shot by vigilantes me	About three quarters of the city would be falling apart and its residents starving. My town is named Procrastiburg and it can barely take care of itself. The Angry Quarter is doing fairly well after it was gentrified by the influx of Jealousy-Motivated transplants, I guess. I really think mayor Argues McWithhimself needs to get his shit together.	0
What was the scariest moment in your life?	The day I found a snake in my washing machine! I live in Oregon (Portland) - not so prone to snakes, especially in 2nd-floor walk up apartments. I nearly had a heart attack. I didn't know what kind of snake it was, it was Sunday so animal control was closed, and I honestly didn't know what to do at all. I called the non-emergency hotline and the woman on the other end straight up told me it was the weirdest call she's ever received. I told her I knew it was crazy! A police officer came and helped me fish it out. The best part is that no one believed me - even when the Sheriff got there he was like, "okay where is this snake (eyeroll)?" I took him to the laundry, opened the door, and he was like "well, fuck, that is a snake!"	My roommate calls on his way home from work. He is going to pick up food. He should be home in 30 minutes tops. 1hr 30 mins later he still isn't home. I call him. Twice. No answers. Apparently lighting hit his work, so he was in emergency overdrive to get stuff back up.	1
A nuclear bomb will detonate above your current location in 1 hour. What do you do?	I’d find the nearest plane and get the F out of there. If there’s no planes around, I would yell at the top of my lungs, “Goodbye Cruel World!”	Well I'd leave. That should be plenty of time to get away from the worst of it, in a car.	0
Two girls with albinism were sent to the hospital with severe sunburns after they were banned from putting on sunscreen at their school's field day because they didn't have a doctor's note. What unfortunate run-ins have you had with zero-tolerance policies?	Honestly, while most zero tolerance policies can be misguided, my middle/high school's no tolerance drinking policies pissed me off. I went to a private school and there was a strict no tolerance policy on drinking. In 8th grade some girls brought alcohol on campus and drank. Got maybe 2 days suspension, most likely because they had rich parents. Honestly, it was ridiculous.	Those bullshit policies that give you 3 or so "bathroom passes" per semester in elementary school. Turned out to be a real shit storm	0
What are some DOs and DON'Ts for aliens trying to invade Earth?	Don't be a hero and fight against the aliens. Think about it. If they have the technologies to travel to Earth. Then they can easily vaporize you. Think of the Europeans with ships and guns who encountered the natives of North America. Not only did the bacteria carried by the foreigner nearly wiped out the indigenous, bows and arrows were no match for guns (range battles).	Always remember that just because you're an alien doesn't mean you're exempt from the rule about invading Russia in the winter.	0
CEOs of reddit, how did you get there?	From my experience on LinkedIn you just set it as your title and then post a bunch of business articles.	Well it starts by being born into a rich family. Then it's just a lot of lying, cheating, stealing, etc. always sacrificing integrity to getting ahead. I never forget to tout myself as the greatest of all time in everything ever. Eventually I became CEO. It's easy, I don't understand why nobody else does it.	1
What things do you hate having to fake care about?	The lives of my coworkers. I don't care how your weekend was, or what your kid did. Get out of my cube and let me work/reddit.	I seriously hate being forced to pretend I care about politically correct issues. If you're fat it's because you eat too much, if you're poor it's because you don't try hard enough, if you're disabled, well that sucks for you, but you're not special because you can't do something. If you're a woman you can be sexist, if you're black you can be racist, if you're a prude well that doesn't mean everyone else has to be. People are so fucking sensitive about everything these days. It's exhausting having a conversation with anyone or around anyone.	1
Girlfriend came home drunk last night and did 3k in damage to my property. Should I feel guilty for having her arrested?	Don't feel guilty, and maybe show your boss a copy of the police report (or at least the list of what was damaged).	At least some of your recent comments makes it look like your balls are finally dropping. I mean seriously? You get depressed over someone fucking up your shit and consider not pressing charges? Get some god damn backbone man or else people will be stepping all over you for the rest of your life.	1
Non-Americans of reddit, what is the "Bigfoot" or "Area 51" equivalent of your country?	In france we have a mythical creature in the mountain regions called a "dahut". What's funny is that it supposedly has shorter legs on one side, either left or right, to accomodate the slopes he lives on. So if you encounter one, you just have to shout, which causes him to turn around, thus falling down because the long legs are now on the top side of the slope... That flaw makes them a rare sight and an endangered species.	FYI to the non-Americans: "Bigfoot" is a mythical creature which some say exist. He's like a giant man/ape thing that lived in the woods. "Area 51" is a classified government site in the desert that the rumor says is where the government conducts research on a crashed alien spaceship, or maybe actual aliens. I always hate the "what's the [obscure reference] of other things?" questions so I wanted to make it less obscure	1
What is your signature quirk when you are drunk?	I'm usually a very introverted person, and tend to only speak with people that I'm close to, but if I'm at a party and I've been drinking, I am talking to everybody! And I get really silly.	Ever since I was young when I got really sick I would always take a shower. It helps me feel better. Well my first time getting blackout drunk I realized my body essentially thinks, "Oh my god she's sick we have to get her in a shower!!!" So, if I get too drunk I wake up in a shower....	0
What is the one thing that scared you the most as a child?	The moment when youre taking your shirt off, and your briefly blinded by it, afraid a monster would take that opportunity to appear in front of you.	Clowns. I saw Stephen King's 'IT' I was so terrified I had trouble sleeping for months. Also I hid behind the couch when my parents were watching 'Candyman' and it gave me a fear of public bathrooms and bees. Public bathrooms still freak me out but for different reasons :/	1
What's the most awkward situation you've ever encountered?	I was working at a Bertucci's when some dude proposed to his gf in front of everyone and got rejected. What made it weird is that neither one of them left. They just sat there while he talked to her with her face buried in her hands.	I was on this website once, and I read about a guy who pooped in his hand trying to light a fart on fire. Awkwardest moment by far, I shit you not.	1
What psychological tricks/ methods do you use in everyday life?	If someone is snoring and you're trying to sleep but don't want to wake them up, knock on a wooden table or closet. I guess in their "sleeping" brain they think someone is knocking on the door and it will stop the snoring for at least 5 minutes. I do this at least 4 times a night when at grandma's house.	Anytime whatsoever i catch somebody staring at me...usually when you lock eyes with the person both people look away but i just hold it and eye fuck them with the typical "what motherfucker" face some people have already looked away and some people are shook and look aesy after a couple seconds but in those who hold it for roughly 3 seconds i see pure terror as they freak out not knowing what to do...and others we just stare endlessly until one breaks or laughs but the later is very very rare I highly recommed everyone tries this its empowering and fun as fuck....my gf literally hates me for this...its a small thing to do but its like a war in my mind and im just fighting battles	1
Women of reddit that have dated a neckbeard how did it go?	I've dated nerds and mostly it's great. Dated one guy who I guess you could call a "neckbeard" though he broke many stereotypes, including that in a lot of ways. He did wear a fedora and have weird issues with women. It went as poorly as you'd imagine. I'm sort of off beat myself so at first he seemed interesting, unique, and like a good match. In actuality he was an insecure jealous mess. Accusations of cheating were a weekly staple of our year long relationship. He'd also go on about how women have more privileges than men and how we have it so easy. He fancied himself a hacker and his life plan was to steal millions of dollars via bank hacking and buy an island. I doubt it worked out for him.	How do all these neckbeards get laid while a nice guy like me can never find a girl? Fucking women always going for the assholes.	1
Police officers of reddit: What current law would you be glad to see removed because you hate having to enforce it?	Police Officer here: I would have to say domestic violence laws because I'm sick and tired of having to deal with these drunken chowder heads every night.	I'm surprised no one has brought up the ID laws in Alabama. Apparently it's a huge pain in the ass for cops to enforce.	0
What would you want your last words to be?	"Please, spread my ashes in a bowl of chili and eat them, so I can tear that ass up one last time..."	And now, the end is near And so I face the final curtain My friend, I'll say it clear I'll state my case, of which I'm certain I've lived a life that's full I traveled each and every highway And more, much more than this, I did it my way	1
What are some unwritten rules of the Girl Code?	ALWAYS leave as much shit out on the bathroom counter as possible. Makeup, Q Tips, hair supplies, it's all good as long as the space is totally unusable for your husband. Also, make sure you have random bobby pins scattered all over the fucking house. Source: Am married to a woman.	Run interference for your fellow women when they're being creeped on in public. They'll give you the please-help-this-guy-won't-leave-me-alone look and you go up to them and say, "Hey, it's been so long since I've seen you! Let's go catch up" (or something similar). She will thank you when you're out of there. If someone needs pads/tampons and you've got extra, give it to them. Ask your friends before dating their exes.	0
What screams insecurity to you?	Someone who puts you down or makes comments about you in your presence while out in a group. Have a friend who does this. On his own he can be a good guy and friendly. When in a group it's like he's trying to be the alpha or distract attention away from him. Constantly makes comments about what you are wearing, or drags up memories or situations from years ago that have no relevance to the company you are in. Tries to pass it off as a joke/banter but just comes across as a prick. Thankfully people aren't stupid and see through it. Oh and he's appeared on /r/justneckbeardthings.	Men and women who dress overly fashionable. To the point where you know they spent nearly an hour picking out their outfit and it's no longer fashionable.	1
What would the world be like if Greek mythology remained the most popular/dominant religion to this day?	I can't really go into specifics but I imagine it would most likely operate like Panhellenic culture of the time did. Most folks aren't super religious but nearly everyone is superstitious and would at least like the idea of being blessed by a god. So we'd have cults for certain gods which there would be really devoted followers while the larger component of society would just participate in the festivals and traditional practices while being mostly secular when it came to politics, civics and attitudes.	Well Greek mythology wasn't a religion persay, so much as many different forces personified as Gods, many of whom were worshipped for their favor, while others were simply acknowledged. Oddly enough I don't think the US would be terribly different. Most newer protestant religions resemble Greek cults anyway. Also, I don't think bonfires to Hestia would be such a bad addition to most major cities. It would certainly make it easier to keep track of the homeless. I expect a few new Gods would have to be invented for the purpose of science. Some of the existing ones would probably take issue but it wouldn't be nearly as big a deal as it is with predeterministic Yaweh. Either, he's right or you're wrong.	1
What's an unsaid rule which pisses you off whenever it's broken?	Don't cut in line! The worst offenders are little old ladies who think they can just sneak right in front of you and pretend it was an accident. It wasn't an accident. You did it on purpose and you think I won't say anything because you're a little old lady.	Try to merge as soon as possible on the highway. People always try to get as far ahead as possible and merge right before their lane ends.	1
What is the dumbest rule you've ever had to follow?	The 10 commandments, I have unfortunately broken them all at one point or another. You shall have no other gods before Me. You shall not make idols. You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Honor your father and your mother. You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. You shall not covet.	At an office for my company they lost all electricity / internet / phone. Someone suggested that they go home and work from home - note that everyone has work laptops. Human Resources said "No because we don't have a work at home policy". So everyone sat in the dark all day twiddling their thumbs until they were done for the day.	0
What instantly makes you suspicious of someone?	When they tell stories that make them look cool when you first meet them. If a really close friend told me the same one I'd probably believe them but not immediately after an introduction!	If they wear a cowboy hat. Instant suspicion of being a racist Trump supporter Similarly, fedoras/trilbys - instant suspicious of being a 4chan neck beard MRA/"nice guy"	1
Do crap parents know they're crap parents? Deadbeat dads and psycho mothers of Reddit - do you know what you are? Why are you that way? Have you made amends with your kids?	No they probably don't. My parents aren't bad parents at all but they like to criticize other parents a lot. My little cousin didn't want to get a haircut and got a Mohawk (which looks fucking stupid) and my parents where saying how shitty parents must be when they can't even get their 7 year old son to get a haircut. My parents can't get my brother to take a shower. He showers like 3 times a week and he's 12. Yesterday they told him to shower like 5 times in the last 20 minutes and he kept refusing. Then I said "What kind of piece if crap parents can't get their 12 year old son to take a shower". Hopefully they stop criticizing others and focus on their dirtyass son first.	Nope. My mother thinks she did a fantastic job and she can't for the life of her understand why I left her house when I was 13.	0
What are you happily addicted to?	Redheaded girls. I've managed to secure a regular supply so I'm in really good shape, if a bit tired in the mornings.	Sleeping with a fan on. I need the noise in order to fall asleep. Girlfriends love this, especially in the winter. The day I was in a hotel and discovered the fan noise app for my phone was a far more momentous day than it should have been.	0
Is the bullying really that bad at US schools?	No people are just pussies and if you do anything to stand up for yourself your treated like a violent criminal. The biggest problem with bullying in America is the pussification of American children and their mothers.	When I see bullying, it usually isn't the atomic wedgie/swirlie scenario you see in movies. It's often exclusion and manipulation, like someone else said. They're mind games. Very few times have I seen anyone get beat up.	0
Non-Americans who have been to the US: What is the weirdest thing about America that Americans don't realise is weird?	My Friend’s wife just moved to DC from Mexico City. She said the strangest thing is that “everything sings.” Didn’t understand at first but then realized she meant everything makes a noise! All of our appliances, crosswalk signs etc.	native American from Canada, Thanks giving dinner, cute tradition but thanks for giving us all smallpox, murdering us and stealing our land and genociding our culture .	1
What is the dumbest way you have injured yourself?	My mother was cooking and oil in a pan caught fire so she quickly carried it out of the house to the courtyard and returned to kitchen (she knew her place). I was about 7 years old and decided i will extinguish the fire by water, i took a small bucket, filled it with water. And since there was only a little flame in the pan i leaned over the pan and slowly poured a stream of water in it. As soon as the water touched the oil, huge fireball went through my face. But no worries, only my hair and eyebrows burnt, skin was fine. Since then i know this LPT: DONT extinguish flaming oil with water!	I was late for class so I started jumping down multiple steps in the stair well. On one flight I jumped too high and hit my forehead on the bottom of the stairs one floor above. Then I fell backwards onto my back on the stairs and slid down the rest of the way. I broke my computer that was in my backpack and got a concussion.	0
What normal thing can’t you do?	I cannot roll my R's. I've been trying since I took spanish in middle school. It just isn't in the cards for me.	Blindly accept progressive values such as "there are more than two genders" and "black people who never went through slavery deserve money from people who never owned slaves."	1
Foreign exchange students of Reddit: was there ever a moment during your stay that made you think "...That's not what I expected."?	Might get downvoted for this.. Not an expierence but I'm looking to be an exchange student for my senior year of high school (2013-2014). I'm American and want to do a program where I can go to Europe. What are some good programs I can look into?	Not quite what you asked, but there's a British TV series called "Tribal Wives" where British women go to live in a completely foreign culture for about a month. In one, the British woman goes to live with a family in rural Mexico. On the first day, she has to use the washroom and asks how they clean themselves (i.e. how they wipe.) The mother of the family she's staying with tells her to pick a rock. The British woman is agog at the thought of using a rock to wipe. Cut to the next scene while she's in the outhouse. The Mexican family is inside and the father asks the mother "Are we out of toilet paper?" and she says "I told her we use a rock" and they all crack up. This might be the best troll I've ever seen.	0
What's the most impressive thing you've ever done while drunk?	Fixed my truck. Don't know what was wrong with it, still don't, but one night I was blackout drunk and when I woke up there were tools everywhere and the truck ran fine	According to the guy making drinks, I had 26 shots worth of Long Islands, I wasn't counting. Surprisingly I remember it all. Proceeded to dance rather well, but I threw up afterwards. I ended up feeling better than everyone else the following morning. That's a natural heavyweight for you.	1
What, in your opinion, is the most ridiculous thing about where you live?	Pennsylvania. We can't buy alchol in grocery stores, gas stations, etc. Shit, we can't even buy it in the same *store*. Gotta go to a seperate store for wine/liquor than beer. And beer distributors won't sell you 6 packs. Gotta go to a bar or similar establishment for them.	I live in south Florida, about an hour north of Miami. The most ridiculous thing about where I live has to be the amount of tourists that come here and don't even bother to learn any English whatsoever, and get upset when I don't speak Portuguese, German, French, etc. (Spanish, I understand. We are very close to Miami, and many people here speak both English and Spanish.) But seriously? Download a translation app or something, you inconsiderate douchebag! I would never come to your country without some knowledge of your language, or at least some kind of translator.	1
You notice you're the last person alive on Earth, what are the 3 things you plan on doing?	&#x200B; 1. Go around and free all the pets trapped in houses that I can so they don't die slow deaths of starvation. I will allow this army of pets to follow me should they see fit, we have the world of full groceries stores at our disposal 2. Travel to places I never could, try to learn secrets (area 51, white house, pentagon, etc.) 3. Erect a monument to humanity somewhere, documenting my time as the only person left while I wait for the inevitable alien arrival	Well the genetic coding of everyone is still around and I figure out how to clone and I clone them and since in still young I raise them and teach them everything I know and can come up with in the ruble of mankind and slowly man will come back	1
The powerball is $700 million. What are some interesting ways of visualizing the odds of winning it?	I had a teacher who taught statistics, and he was talking about a professor or something (It was last year, don't burn me please) who said that the odds of winning the lottery were something like: You go to a horse race, you bet on the horse that has a broken leg. Halfway through the race that horse gets struck by lightning. Right before the finish line it gets struck by lightning again. Then it wins. There you go collect your 700 million, Reddit.	I'm thinking of a number between one and 2000. Pick it. Now I'm thinking of a hair on your head. Tell me which one. Getting both of those right is about how likely one is to win.	0
Smokers that throw cigarette butts out of car windows. Why do you do that?	When I smoked cigarettes, it was out of laziness, and ironically, not wanting my car to smell like cigarettes. Cleaning out a car ash tray regularly seemed like too much work... yeah	TIL being upset that people break the law, cause harm to the environment, and display lazy behavior will get me downvoted.	1
What "phase" did you go through that you're embarrassed about now?	Started my emo phase when I was around 13, 21 now and I'm still waiting to "grow out of it"	When I was younger I would ride my bike with a snorkeling mask because it was the closest thing I had to a motorcycle helmet and I wanted to look cool	0
Redditors who've meet the parents/family of the person you intended to marry and then decided against marrying them after meeting them what happened?	I feel really bad about this but I broke it off because her parents told me she used to be Christian. To this day, I don't know if I made a mistake. I mean, things have changed over the years, it seems more ok today then it was back in the 80s.	Not so much after I met her family, but after she met mine. She wouldn't stop being extremely possessive of me around them (lots of kissing/inappropriate touching) then get mad when I (politely) asked her to stop. Then she lied several times. We're talking being pregnant, not being pregnant, actually being pregnant, having an abortion, having cancer. Among others. But really, her meeting my family was the beginning of the end.	0
What’s the strangest thing you believed as a child?	this will sound weird.. but i believed that a man in the sky watched us 24/7 and allows horrific things to happen to people that he could stop easily but doesnt (he has super power) but then gets to judge our morality.	That stunt people actually died when they did stunts, so they used really really old people who didn't mind dying.	0
Reddit, what made you think "It's 2018, this shouldn't still be a problem"?	That people still need to be convinced racism and sexism is still a significant problem. There is an overwhelming body of research & data that is just a google click away to demonstrate this. The idea that simply saying "black lives matter" should be a controversial statement is such a pathetic reflection of our society. As Michael Che says, "it doesn't say 'matters more,' just 'matters.'"	Fucking printers. Why are they so bad at working properly? It seems like every other household appliance or device has gotten one of those "smart" upgrades, but printers are still shitty.	0
Students of Reddit, what was the biggest teacher meltdown you ever witnessed?	I did a stint in culinary school when I was young. Chef threw a whole stack of plates across the kitchen because people were joking/laughing as they cleaned up. With a thick German accent he screamed, "You think this is funny?!?!" and threw a stack of about a dozen plates, which shattered, and we had to clean up.	In high school we used to fuck with this one ancient Spanish teacher. She was probably 80 and still on her grind. One day after lunch I put an open pint of milk inside a piñata she had on a bookshelf. Fast forward a week or so later, and this motherfucker starts to stink. My friends and I all ham it up, moaning at the smell and saying we can't possibly learn anything in that classroom. We go on and on about it, then suddenly she snaps and starts flipping shit over around the room looking for the smell, screaming in Spanglish. Eventually she shook the piñata and as hot leche started leaking from its feet, she turned to us, wild-eyed and said, "¿Por qué?" Looking back, I feel badly about it because she really wasn't so bad.	1
What's a mistake that you're glad you made?	I was on IRC back in 1997 chatting in #teens when some random girl with a freaky username messages me. I don't usually respond to "ASL" chats, but for some reason I did. She was very depressed and suicidal because of her situation with her parents. I didn't want to get involved but did anyways. I gave her my phone number and address so we could talk offline, which I knew at the time was a mistake since this girl was not right. Eventually things cooled down. Now we're married and have been together for 14 years. Best mistake of my life.	Joining a fraternity. I hate fraternities, what people do to rush freshman, and how people get so into their bros and raging balls everyday. I hate sororities even more, they suck originality out of girls and make all the girls hate each other. But I sure as hell am glad I am in one. I have an extra group of guys I can always go chill with, I get to go on sweet formals paid for by loaded alumni, girls automatically think I'm somewhat cool (I go to a very shallow school), and I dont just sit around all day with nothing to do like my friend who are GDIs.	1
Customer service workers, what are some passive aggressive things you do at your job to piss off rude customers?	Write them citations. It's called the asshole tax. Discounting major offenses, 90% of whether or not you get a ticket is your behavior. "I pay your salary!!!" Yep. So does everyone else, you'll just be contributing a bit more now.	I follow every procedure to the letter. Trust me, my company policies piss people off more than anything I could ever do. I just stop bending the rules for people that are going to be pissy with me.	0
What did school teach you that was blatantly false once you researched it on the Internet?	Meathead asshole social studies "teacher" informed us that the Roman empire fell because homosexuality had become acceptable. He was a football coach. Want to improve education in this country? Get rid of high school athletics.	I had a second grade teacher tell me that the reason parachutes had holes in them was because without the holes the parachuters would never come down to earth. When I asked why parachuters didn't stay up there as long as they wanted and only cut out the hole when they wanted to come down, she drew a diagram on the board which showed how a parachuter could never reach the top of the parachute so they had to cut the holes beforehand.	0
Americans who visited Europe, what was your biggest WTF moment?	Another stupid 'What is Europe like?' question. It's a huge continent with 50 (ish) nations in it most of which have wildly different cultures and people within them never mind between them all.	My wife and I went to Venice, Italy this spring for our honeymoon. We were in our room when loud ass sirens started going off. Being from the US, the only time we ever hear sirens like these are for tornadoes. It was loud and had different pitches instead of one, long siren. It really sounded like an alien invasion. Turns out, the sirens are for high tides and flooding in the next few hours. The hotel we were in had shin-high water in our lobby for a few hours. Definitely a weird experience for us, but completely normal there.	0
How do you make money on the side ?	Not money, necessarily.. But whilst I was studying my undergraduate degree I worked on a paper (outside of uni) which was published, I'm now doing my PhD and working on another. I believe that working on side projects, gaining experience and networking will pay dividends later.	Bartending weddings and handyman work. If you have any type of skills around the house, you can do quite well. While in-between jobs, I put out fliers in the parking lot of a Lowes in an upscale area. I was making like $500-600/week just installing fans, swapping faucets, installing some mouldings, etc. As long as you show up, give a fair price and do good work, people will pass your name along. Shit it's been 3 years since I put fliers out and I still get random calls to do odd jobs	0
Employers of Reddit, what has been your most awkward interview for a new employee ever?	one time I was interviewing this candidate for an analyst position. Dude had fuckin 3 thumbs. One thumb on the left hand but 2 thumbs on the right. How do you not ask about that? Well I did, and it turns out that the third thumb was just his pointerfinger. Fuck that shit edit: this was all a lie. Please still downvote. But just know that	Me: do you want a glass of water? Applicant: yes Me: (fuck I don't have one, awkward silence follwed by) so tell me about yourself	0
Has a friend ever done something that made you decide to drop them from your life? Did you tell them or just stop talking to them?	One old friend threw my puppy into my stove, not inside, but into the glass. He thought it was hilarious, I just stopped answering his calls.	She asked my husband to be a sperm donor so she could get pregnant with her lesbian partner. After that, I just simply stopped returning her calls. When we moved to a new house, I didn't give her the number. Haven't heard from her in years. Thank goodness.	1
People who lost their jobs by going off on a customer, what is your story?	Back around 1969, I saw a service advisor at a VW dealership get fired for telling an irate customer "If you can't take a joke, you shouldn't have bought a Volkswagen."	I was the only waiter at a greasy spoon and and had several tables. This young teenage boy was doing nothing but drinking tea. He would down the Tea then start yelling for more while I was still working with other tables who were actually ordering food. This happened 3 or 4 times and he was being quite obnoxious All about the 4th trip with the tea pitcher I very carefully tipped the fully filled glass of tea into his lap. I say carefully because I wanted to make it look like an accident. He stood up screaming at me refused to pay for the T and left the restaurant. I received a standing ovation from the rest of my tables.	1
What was the stupidest reason you've ever got in trouble for at school?	Middle School, PMSing teacher lectures us about us calling her master. I call her master, she gets mad, I call her slave.. In retrospect, I regret it, just a little	In the 7th grade a fart in class was blamed on me because I was laughing, because farts are funny. I was given detention and lectured by the Assistant Vice Principal about how he only farts once a week when sitting on the toilet.	0
I'm thinking about online dating. Any advice?	Are you a guy? Don't send pictures of your dick. Are you a girl? Guys will send you pictures of their dick.	My wife and I met on eHarmony. It takes a bit to fill out all their questionnaires but when you finish it is worth it.	1
What do you think about electronic cigarettes?	Vaping got me completely off cigarettes, which is something I thought I'd never experience considering I *loved* smoking. Contrary to patches, gums and whatnot, it's a way to quit with *pleasure* and not *pain*, and that's why it works so well. I'd guess that's why there's so much opposition to it, I think people can't get off that Protestant notion that *good* only comes with *pain*.	I hate the term vape, I hate that you 'can totes smoke indoors now and in high school and you're edgy and cool' but ANYTHING is better than smoking real name-brand cigarettes. They're terrible for you, expensive, and support horrible companies.	1
What do you think happened after the Truman Show?	He walked through the door, was tied up, drugged and raped for the rest of his life up in the moon by his creator. happy days -Play happy days theme-	Truman probably went into therapy for depression, PTSD, and remaining paranoia for one thing... He probably found an amazing lawyer to sue the tv corporation for compensation, as an effectively unpaid movie star who didn’t sign a contract agreeing to any terms, and a litany of other things. That might have set him up for life. He probably traveled to Fiji anyway, and a whole lot of other places. Maybe he would have taken some commercial deals for it, done ads... or possibly a tv show (with visible cameras) to fund the traveling... or maybe he never wanted anything to do with television again.	0
Redditors who don't like/understand video games, why not?	They just don't hold my attention. I have friends who can play for hours at a time but no matter what game it is, I lose interest in an hour, save my spot and do something different for the day.	so many passive aggressive "it is a waste of time" and "I have a real life" posts. Try wording your high horse comments in a way that isn't derogatory.	1
What is the most re-watchable movie ever made?	Office Space every couple of years I went from being a server to office environment though, so i have grown new appreciations for it	Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. I love that character "Jar Jar Binks." Isn't he great? I could watch his antics all day!	1
What is your best 'How many people does it take to change a light bulb' joke?	How many Marxists does it take to screw in a lightbulb? None, the lightbulb contains the elements of its own revolution.	How many feminists does it take to change a lightbulb? None. They just bitch and moan until a man does it for them, then complain about misogyny	1
What is the funniest instance of "rage quitting" you have ever experienced?	I was fighting this huge epic battle. There were so many people involved. I can't really go into detail. But this one guy on the enemy team was trying to "purify the human race" or something, but he wasn't winning the battle. So pretty much at the end of the fighting, he ran into his bunker and killed himself. We Allies won.	Don't even know what caused it, but I was playing Halo 3 with a friend of mine who is relatively well known for his anger issues. Someone killed him (or the match ended and we had lost or something) and over the headset, I heard "aaaaaAAAHHHHHHH" followed by a "mmmyoink" as he literally bit through the cord to his mic.	0
[Serious]Redditors who believed (or had people close to them who believed) the world was going to end on whatever date, what lead you to believe that and how do you feel about it looking back?	2012, didn't believe absolutely, more like cautions preparation. Replaced an old vehicle with a new SUV, stocked up on water and canned goods, and took that Friday off (for last minute Christmas prep I think is the excuse I used). On the 22nd, I donated a bunch of the canned stuff for the local Christmas drive, didn't have to buy bottled water for awhile, still loving the SUV. Thought I remember afterward wondering if we would look back and wish something major had happened. Considering everything that's happened since... kinda wish there had been a population thinning event.	I was 15 during Y2K, and my family and I all agreed that it was a giant joke. We planned to go to a cabin in the woods for New Years, because that's what we did for "every" New Years...it was just our tradition. But as we got in the car to head for the cabin, my 10-year-old stepbrother just breaks down in tears. Woah, dude...what's wrong? Turns out his dad had become a "survivalist" who told him the world was going to end on Y2K, and they would never see each other again. As none of us had really spoken to his dad in years, we had no idea of the insane bullshit he was filling my step-brother's head with.	0
I suspect my girlfriend is remote-controlled by her mom and she doesn't understand how brainwashed she is. How do I stop this?	I have to ask is she just asking for you to change and you're not comfortable with the requests? To me it sounds like her mom may be influencing her but you're kind of standing your ground on not trying to improve yourself or your relationship and are trying to be complacent when your GF wants to progress.	I have a friend in the same boat. 11 years later, with 3 children, and a new home right next door to her mother? He wishes he'd taken my advice and run away. Run away.	0
Employed people of Reddit, what are the little things about your career that the average joe coming into the workforce would never consider?	Stockbroker. I don't trade my own money. The more I learn about trading, the more I don't want to do it. I like to keep my money.	I think most people who have never entered the workplace fail to understand how much it costs to actually get to work.	0
What's the smallest thing that annoys you every time it happens?	Hitting CTRL+V and getting the previous item you copied from earlier but no longer need, instead of what you thought you had copied for your current application of this function. For example, I highlight an address and press CTRL+C, thinking that I copied it. When I go to paste the address, a word or phrase that I copied from a previous task gets pasted into the field instead. When this happens several times it gets annoying really quick.	People trying to merge a half mile before construction starts or the lane ends. You know you're just making traffic worse right?	1
What’s a "Let that sink in" fun fact?	The United States hasn’t minted any new Purple Heart medals since World War II. We’ve been using the stockpile that was prepared in anticipation of a ground invasion of Japan.	That Donald Trump became, and is still President. Under his shadow, we're losing net neutrality, we're taking climate control off of our list of worries, we're reducing national land to sell if off to the highest bidder, we've lost our standing on the global stage....the list can go on and on and on. I am ashamed.	1
Which band do you regret you'll never be able to see live?	Queen with Freddie Mercury. I've seen them twice with Adam Lambert, and I love him, but I'd kill to see Freddie.	All of you uncultured Troglodytes spouting nonsense about Queen and other “bands” not worthy of the title cacophony. I however long to hear the beautiful chorus of sticks and rocks being swung spastically at bigger rocks back in the good old Golden Age of Rocks. My generation cannot appreciate beautiful Stone Age music and opt to listen to drivel about sex, drugs and money instead of truly beautiful anthems as “OOGA BOOGA MAMKOO GOOGA”. I was born in the wrong generation, Upvote if you too long to have lived in 1960’s BCE.	1
Parents of Reddit what was your “ wow I’m really out of touch with kids” moment?	Not me but when I told my wife that our 7 year old boys have discovered the Slenderman, she was like who's that. My own moment was when I installed Snapchat and opened it up, couldn't figure out which way to swipe or what button to push for first 3 minutes. I'm a software developer.	Popular music. It's garbage. Kids luv how catchy it is I guess. Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucci gang. Is apparently a song. Also rhyming the word "middle" 4000 times is also a song.	1
What does your SO think they're getting away with that you totally know about?	i know everything he thinks i don’t, i know about girls he hooked up with before me, i know everything he has said about me to his friends well fighting, honestly just boring stuff but i read between the lines and can remember details from years ago far too well.	He hides tool purchases for work, despite me telling him constantly that if he needs them, buy them. They're expensive and we're pretty broke but dude-you need them for the job you have that pays our bills. I don't care if it's $5 or $500. I am also on the bank account and get notifications for purchases. So I SEE YOU HONEY. IT'S COOL.	0
So I was just walking my dog around the neighborhood. Saw a really fat man (morbidly obese) walk/jogging. He seemed to be struggling. As he passed me I told him, "Keep it up. You're lookin good!" He looked back at me and said, "Fuck you!" What attempts to be nice have backfired on you?	you shouldve just told him the truth hey man good work, hopefully you wont be so fat the next time i see you	Something i witnessed- a homeless man sleeping on the sidewalk under a skinny tree at lunch. His shoes are his pillow. Cue tourist with stroller, she bends over and, gently taps him to make sure he's okay. He wakes up in a rage and starts chasing her and her stroller down the street.	0
What's a NSFW reason you've had to break up with someone?	Dated a girl 2 years. One day she calls me crying, seems she found out her father wasn't her biological father. Come to find out her biological father is my grandmothers youngest brother. Fucking Alabama.	Her clit was too big.... I mean it was like 20 percent bigger than a tic tac. She would send me pics naked and in her underwear. I love me some cameltoe pics of girls in their underwear, but with her.... nope. Just some chonies with meat trying to pop out the top. Roughest part about it was she was a blonde hair Jew that weighed 105 lbs tops, that clit must of weighed at least 5 pounds.	1
How do you believe the "demise of Reddit" will come about? When and why will people stop using this site?	UI Change. I've been through this before. Slashdot, Fark, Digg, and now Reddit. All of them "revamped" their UI, and all of them lost users because of it. The only reason Facebook hasn't suffered the same fate is that it has achieved some sort of critical mass where even if you want to leave, you have to come back to communicate with your acquaintances and friends.	For me it's the sheer numbers and attitudes of all the liberal cocksuckers on this site. Talks about gun control piss me off. I abhor socialism and I don't care about gay marriage or gay rights either way. Every time I post a politically conservative view I get downvoted to oblivion or ridiculed.	1
What is your biggest frustration with Reddit right now?	The fact it's changing towards a social media format (profiles, them bugging me for my account verification all the time). Vote/post manipulation/social engineering/shilling/inauthentic content. That and there doesn't seem to be anything new. It's all the same old shit sometimes Edit: I said phone number to validate my account, but it's mainly other things like location data, validate email, update your profile etc that make reddit less anonymous	I think it’s way to sexist and America centered for my liking. Gaming is literally karma whoring cosplay pictures with girls. The spectrum you are judged on politically is broken down into republicans and liberals which makes no sense outside of the us.	1
Let's reverse the roles here; teachers, what is the stupidest things parents have told you?	Wish I recall some of the stories I've heard from my mom (she's a preschool/kindergarten teacher). Suffice to say parents are stupid a lot, almost certainly more often than teachers (and teachers have the option to stop being teachers, parents can't really stop being parents (child abandonment and adoption aside). It's not really surprising since teachers often get experience with a large number of children, parents have to figure it out as they go along.	Not a teacher, but worked on reception in a school for a while. You'd often get stupid parents come through - ones that told me that they couldn't afford school uniform for the children because they've just bought a new fur coat, so refused to send the kids to school until the school argeed to pay for the uniform. The one that took the biscuit was a parent ringing up to complain their child was still in bed. She wanted someone from the school to come get them out of bed, because it was "within school hours", so it was our responsibility now. She didn't like it when informed it wasn't. "What, you mean that it's MY responsibility to get them into school?" "Yes. Yes it is."	0
Lawyers of Reddit, what is the most unjust court case you've ever seen?	That truck driver who saved himself from freezing and left truck. The one sessions said should have volunteered to die for the company and should have been fired.	Had a guy who was accused by his very troubled high school age daughter of molesting her because he took away her cell phone. He had to post a bunch of bail, lost his job, prohibited from seeing his other daughters (who all said "Oh that's just A lying and being dramatic, Dad would never do that") or living at his house, mixed up with CPS, etc. I even found the witness to whom she admitted that she made the whole thing up. State still refused to dismiss. A week before trial they read the statements from the rest of the family about what a pathological liar this girl is, talk to the witness she admitted the lie to, and dismiss the case. No apology, much less any compensation for the year of hell he went through and thousands of dollars he and his family spent on the case.	0
Have you ever had a bad gut feeling that something was off so you left, only to find out that something did happen and what's the story?	Was at a mall and suddenly noticed a bunch of black teenagers everywhere. I high tailed it out of there, and the next day, their violence and theft was on the local news.	I had a feeling this guy I dated once was cheating on me... I asked him if he'd tell me if there was something going on, because I was afraid to ask outright. He told me I was crazy and that I was terrible for doubting him, etc etc.. I felt terrible and really did feel like I was crazy. Broke up with him a year later for other reasons and that's when he decided there was something he just HAD to tell me. I was right, but that didn't make it any easier to stomach.	0
What was your last random act of kindness?	i saw someone trip on their shoe lace, so i put them down to put them out of their misery	Found a cat with a roll of thick duck tape around her neck and mouth, she couldn't eat and was barely breathing. Took 20 minutes to unroll it because she wouldn't stop scratching my hands.	0
What was the horniest/sexiest tension you've had in the strangest/most boring places?	I broke the bro code years ago. Dude and his longtime gf broke up. He cheated on her and she wanted revenge and out of all the dudes we were friends with she hooked up with me. That day dear reddit, i was a sexual dynamo. A long stroking champion experience i was never able to duplicate. Thing is, his gf and i hated each other. However, when she showed up and said "fuck me you asshole" i pulled her in my stank ass bachelor pad and smashed that puss. Lost a bro over it. Didnt care...hottest sex i ever had.	I was at the dentist, squirted a bit of saliva out of my mouth, and the female dental hygienist says, "Oh, you're a squirter! Me too!"	0
What should you be aware of before moving out and beginning to live independently for the first time?	Get as many roommates as possible. Just because you can afford it, doesn't mean you have to buy it. Don't buy Christmas gifts. Fix your car; don't buy a new one.	take pics of the apt before moving your stuff in, the carpet, the floors, baseboards, everything. Just to cover your ass. Some landlords are total POS and will try to keep security for a stain in the rug that was there when you moved in.	0
What's your favourite breakfast meal?	It's not healthy, and if I eat it my appetite is shot for the day, but chicken fried steak, two eggs over medium, hashbrowns, biscuits and sausage gravy, black coffee.	I could eat McDonald's Bacon Egg & Cheese McGriddles every day. With black coffe and stevia sweetener. No hash browns though.... just those succulent, delectable Mc Griddles. The rest of their menu is pig turds. I want a giant McGriddle instead of a wedding cake.	1
Why doesn't anybody make Super Saiyan costumes for cats?	I'm upvoting this just because I want to see it on the front page. On another note, you might be a crazy person.	Because as a general rule cats hate costumes and will try to get skin shredding vengeance on people who try to put them in costumes?	1
My extremely conservative boss just came up to a group of us (knowing we were Democrats) and lectured/yelled at us for 15 minutes on why our vote was wrong. What's the most uncomfortable sitatuation you've faced at work?	A couple of years ago my boss took me out to lunch and out of nowhere decided to spend the entire hour explaining how he absolutely did not want to sleep with me. By the end I was convinced that he absolutely wanted to sleep with me.	Here's what I would do: - Gather all those who heard the rant. - Go to HR and all collectively report the guy. - Watch and laugh as his career ends for creating a hostile work environment.	1
40+ y/o redditors, were the youth of your generation as pissed off at the likes of Michael Jackson, Prince, U2, Guns N' Roses, Def Leppard etc. winning awards and dominating the music industry as we now are at Justin Bieber and Nicki Minaj?	Those bands, no. But there were others, like The New Kids on the Block who were loved by an audience of teen girls and were pretty much despised by the boyfriends of said girls. The NKotBs and beibers of music make the studios money and are quickly relagated to near obscurity. In 10 years it will be some other kid/band that is a huge moneymaker that everyone loves to hate.	Another question: were there hipsters back then, what music did they listen to, and is it still at all relevant today? EDIT: Oh wow, **Hip**pies.	1
How do you deal with suicidal thoughts if you're not willing to talk to anyone about it?	Me I nut up and follow through. I've successfully killed myself dozens of times but I'm too alpha to actually die.	The knowledge that I won't actually do it, but that the possibility exists regardless is comforting in a weird way. Having that option of disappearing completely calms me down and makes me feel as if I'm in control again when it just becomes too much.	0
At a 4th of July BBQ, I summarily executed a 7 year old during a NERF capture the flag war. When did you suddenly realize how ruthless you can be?	Anyone ever play the board game diplomacy? It's basically a WWI strategy game that will wreck friendships. I played it once and it ended with a screaming match and everyone silently getting into their cars and going home. Fun game, but never again.	The year was '01. Our rivals, the third graders(i was in fourth at the time), challenged us to a dodgeball game. Of course, we accepted the challenge. The setting was perfect. It was dark and it was raining hard. Everywhere you looked you could see people falling. It was three of us against the last third grader. We all looked at each other and grinned. We threw all of our balls as hard as we could at the survivor. Two to the stomach and one to the face, the kid went down. I bent down to the kid and said sorry and said I would buy him an ice cream. I helped him up and asked which one? He then said "the one that's tree fiddy" I then noticed he was a 500 foot tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.	1
Reddit- it's time to go throwaway shopping- what is the weirdest, creepiest, or just all-around most terrible thing you have have ever done that no one knows about?	No throwaway, momma didn't raise no bitch. I purposefully, dead sober and fully aware of the consequences, bought, prepared, and ate a Hawaiian pizza. With pineapple. It was fucking glorious.	Not me but a friend of mine went to a house party with a friend. Nobody at the party knew my friend and the owner of the house was being a huge asshole to him. My buddy snuck a pot into the bathroom, took a huge shit in the pot, put the pot on the oven, and cranked the burner and left	0
Straight men of reddit, what's the attraction of anal sex with a woman?	It's sort of like NASA and the moon. A long time ago they looked at that beautiful orb hanging in the night sky and thought "We are not supposed to be there. It will be costly. It will be dangerous. Some people might say it's not supposed to happen." But they did it anyway. And that's why we do it in the pooper.	As Jim Jeffries puts it: "Women, the reason men like fucking you in the ass is...because we know you fucking hate it."	1
Why were you picked on in school?	My family was very poor. I always wore hand-me-downs that were from the seventies. I didn't get a new pair of shoes until I was in middle school. My family was bullied mercilessly. I had a 40 minute bus ride, and my brothers and I were picked on every day for the entire ride to and from school. It was awful. Even the bus driver joined in on the torment. I joined the junior wrestling team in fourth grade and got really good. In high school, I broke most of the school records and eventually placed at states. Once I finally realized that I was basically practicing unarmed combat everyday since I was 9, I put a stop to the bullying quite easily.	-For being a guy that expressed emotions -For being black and talking white -For not falling into the acceptable realm of masculinity, pretty sure I'm asexual	1
Estate Attorneys - What's the most brutal thing you've ever put in a will or had to read at a will reading?	My grandma put a broom in her will for my mom (her Daughter-in-law) and said, "Maybe now *your* house can finally be clean." **EDIT** Sorry grandma.	To my daughter, I leave you the entirety of my estate under the condition that you tattoo a penis onto your forehead because I believe it will be funny.	1
Teachers of Reddit, what is the worst case of bullying you have ever seen from a Teacher, or Student?	We had to make something for chemistry and there was this fat kid who was pretty much terrible at anything excluding picking flowers. Well the teacher assumed he created poison so was going to feed it to his pet, luckily this sweet girl helped him make it not so poisony. Wonder where Neville is now.	A kid once lost an eye in a "birthday prank" where ~15 students threw eggs at the guy. One hit him badly in the eye, and his reaction to try to take pieces of shell out of there immediately pretty much made it impossible to save it. Pranksters didn't even realize what had happend from what I heard. The kid didn't come back to that school, and the students were suspended for a month or something. It was a pretty peaceful month.	0
Can you give me your most arrogant, smug, self centred and cocky remark about yourself that is true?	I'm a lot more mature and educated than my American peers because I grew up and went to school in Europe. Edit: Because of all the hate I'm getting, I should point out that this post was supposed to be arrogant and smug. Do I think this sometimes? Yeah, and my observations support my hypothesis for the most part. Do I say it out loud or behave condescendingly towards others because of it? No. I'm actually a very pleasant person. I don't go around acting like I'm better than everyone else. I don't hate Americans, I'm American myself. Yeah, there are a lot of things I don't like about the US, but I wouldn't be living there if there weren't a few things that I do like. This comment was fitting for this thread so I posted it.	I used to be a lifeguard, and when asked for my job description I would say, "I'm paid to sit on an elevated pedestal and look down on everyone in anticipation of their eventual failure."	0
Redditors who now own their parents' homes: is it weird sleeping in your parents' bedroom?	It was a bit weird at first, but once my husband and I completed our renovations it didn't even feel like the same house anymore. But for some reason I can orgasm when having sex in my old childhood room where my father raped me almost daily.	My sister bought my parents' home. I've only slept in their bedroom once when I was housesitting for her, but it wasn't too weird. I was drunk anyway it was the night my sister got married and she was staying in a hotel. What's weird is she's changed so many things, and it's the house I grew up in, so I'll go to look for the garbage and it's not in the same cabinet anymore and even though I KNOW she has moved it I still look there every damn time.	0
What video game's story deserves to be made into a movie?	This is a gimme....but Zelda Ocarina of Time would be a killer movie! Preferably 6 hours long so that we could see a battle at every temple as both kid and adult Link. A large chunk of the movie would have to be spent on Link stalling out at the Water Temple and contemplating giving up on his journey. Who would star as Link and Zelda though.....?	*Red Dead Redemption* had a great story and scenery that would translate well to the big screen. Wouldn't mind seeing that.	0
What's a trend that you've never understood or liked?	Being mean to people who work at the drive thru window at fast food places. Trends like "Fire in the hole". I just don't understand what's fun about being mean to some innocent person and ruining his or her day.	Taking selfies. Everyone looks lame in them. Especially guys. Guys should NEVER take selfies. I've seen too many guys try looking good in a selfie, they just look like try-hards.	1
What is your hidden talent that you cannot tell others about?	I've accepted and embraced that I am a sociopath. It comes very easy to me to manipulate people to do what I want. It has lead me to where I am now (29, 2* median average wage, leading 64 people).	Lockpicking. It is just better not to tell anyone about it. People get weird when they know you could get past their locks. And if something should disappear mysteriously... guess who they will suspect?	0
What family member do you like least? And why?	A family member who voted for Trump and then lost his farming job due to China cutting back buying soybeans...and he still supports the Orange Moron. Enjoy being poor in the Minnesota, bud!	My father. He is narcissistic, self absorbed, a liar, a cheater... His self worth relies solely on how he can out do his own adult children. He changes history at his whim to validate his delusions. I "followed" his steps and became a Marine. Then I figured out his stories were pure bullshit lies. He has no honor. He has no self respect. He has nothing but a poorly crafted web of lies. Even if he saw this post, he would never think it was about him.	0
It may sound insignificant, but I just paid off my credit card, my car and my student loan and now don't owe any bank a single dollar. What are your achievements you'd like to share?	I finally kissed a girl, granted I sucked at it, but still, for a guy who had no friends till a month ago it's a huge step.	Two of my exes committed suicide. It makes me feel really good, as if they there's no point in living unless I am a part of your life.	1
What's the point of posting comment on 1000+ comment post?	Comments now numbering 1000+ and as my very first comment I figured why the hell not.. I'M DOING SOMETHING ORIGINAL AND UNIQUE! LOVE ME DAMNIT!	Sometimes I read through the new posts instead of the best posts. A lot of the high rated ones are just one liners that while funny don't really progress the discussion. Depends on the post content though.	0
Youth sports referees of Reddit, what is the worst parent meltdown you've ever experienced?	My spouse was coaching a youth soccer game (girls, U10) and the ref was about 15. He called a foul and a dad from the other team ran onto the field and began chasing the ref. Spouse, the assistant coach, and the team's parents formed a wall and yelled at the ref to get behind us. The kid was shaking, and in shock kept repeating he needed to get his corner flags. No, kid. The game is over. Go to your car, go home. We'll get your flgs for you. The daughter of the dude was just standing on the field crying.	I was about 14, reffing a basketball game, under 11s I think it was.... this one dude was just an asshole, ever screaming at his own son (who wasn't that good, but his dad seemed to believe he was a prodigy) while on TO... disgusting to watch. Anyways lucky for me, my dad was their watching me that weekend tournament, cause the dude rushed me when I called a foul on his son, he shoved me from behind to the ground, then gave me one kick to the stomach, my dad came out popped him with a 1,2 and dude was sleeping... lucky for guy tho I was able to calm my old man down saying the kick didnt even hurt, or he probably would have killed him	1
What is the most embarrassing way you've hurt yourself?	When I was 15 i'd just seen Final Destination 3, I was in my girlfriends house at the time and she had a staple gun so I held it like a gun and pulled the lever to fire out a staple. Except I had it back to front, and my thumb was right over the staple hole. I nearly got her to call an ambulance because I almost fainted and had a staple wedged in my thumb, I still shake my head about that.	While ironing a shirt I had an itch in my other forearm so my brain thought it was a good idea to use the hot flatiron to scratch it. I have a burnmark the size of a handprint ever since...	0
What is something you feel like you'll never understand?	Gay folks. Let the down voting commence, but I just do not legitimately understand it. I am all about equal rights for them, and I don't have any hate against them. I will never be able to relate or understand it. Maybe reddit can enlighten me.	What the difference is between pressing C or CE on a calculator. I just hit both of them like 12 times just to make sure all the data is clear before I input a new problem.	0
I just bought a wheelchair accessible van for my daughter for a dollar. What things have strangers done for you that have restored your faith in humanity?	When my family fled north from hurricane Katrina, ran into a guy in the middle of the night at a gas station that offered us his guest house as all hotels were booked anywhere north of the coast for hundreds of miles. Turns out he is loaded, and his guest house is posh. Big screen, hot tub, works. Tells us to come by this restaurant the next day, and he feeds the whole family and comps the bill. Turns out he owns the restaurant. So we stayed there a couple nights and this guys is just over the top nice. Wouldn't take anything. Tl;dr- rich stranger shelters my family during Katrina EDIT: the restaurant is Trailboss in Macon, MS	One time my car broke down and I was stuck on the side of the road, a mexican gentleman stopped to help, when i offered payment for the job he had done he simply replied, "no no, today you, tomorrow me" in broken english	1
Whats your best cop/police story?	Was under 21, had been drinking that night but wasn't too drunk to drive or anything, got pulled over for expired registration, becomes shaky and panicked because I think my life is over. Cop looks at me, smiles, and says "get those tags taken care of, son. Have a good night."	Cops blew up this house party i was at. Not just any party but an ABC party so there i am in nothing but superman boxers and a blue cape with the logo printed on my bare chest.... While everyone was running out the front door i decided to be "smart" and sneak out back by a gate i saw while taking a piss. I get to the gate all happy and shit but when i try opening it it keeps getting stuck after i push it open about a foot. After trying it a couple of times a cop pulls the gate open and tells me to stop hitting him with the gate...	0
What is your favorite "secret menu" item?	The pub nearby my apartment has a great Chicken Wing set with a super spicy sauce. Only regulars know about it.	At Tim Hortons, order a large Ice Capp with whip cream but instead of the milk just ask for the whipped cream blended through. It tastes kind of fluffy, if that makes sense. OH also a large hot chocolate with a peppermint tea bag. I get that there is mint flavor shots but fuck that the syrup is gross.	0
You're offered a job. It's 12 hours per weekday and you start off making $10,000, however your income doubles every year. $10k, $20k, $40k, $80k, and so on. Do you take the job?	Pass. Even at shitty minimum wage (7.50$ per hour) with overtime you should be making almost 30k the first year. So 3 years of work to be paid what you should be paid on the first day. It's a no from me.	If job security is there, then yes I would. I’m 24 so within 10 years I’ll be making over a million a year, and I’d be able to retire comfortable at the age of 35	0
What's a harsh truth you have for the opposite sex?	**we don't want to know about your period** Sorry if you have cramps take midol or say you don't feel well. This whole "omg I'm on my period" is out of hand. To guys this is bathroom stuff. Keep it there. Same to guys about your poop. Congrats it's well established everyone poops. Edit: not relationships. Although it shouldn't be a big production. My ex used it for an excuse to be mean. No she didn't apologize and constantly used it against me. "You're only mad because you don't get it"....	Just cause you make him hard doesn't mean you're all that special. A guy can get hard from, as I've heard someone on this site say, "a stiff breeze and eye contact."	0
What is the most awful way to break up with someone ?	I was dating an older woman who I found out was banging alot of people I worked with, so I told her when she was drunk I was going to leave her. When she got upset and asked what she could do to keep me, I told her that if she gave me anal I would stay ( we never could do it due to my length and girth). I pounded her ass then left while she was asleep.	"Do you want to get married?" "I...oh my god, yes!! Yes!!" "Well I sure don't. Come in and get your shit out of my house."	0
What video game brings back the most nostalgia for you?	That game where you had to cross the street. You know the one that was just made out of big squares? I was great on that game and by the end of the 90s you could play that in everything, I think even McDonald’s had some toys with it on the Happy Meals.	Star Wars Battlefront I and II from Lucasarts. No other game from my childhood captured that large-scale feeling of battle, not to mention the perfectly done Star Wars setting. The new games are fucking travesties.	0
Have you ever called 911? If so why?	brother was drinking + had some pills in his system which resulted in him falling down a flight of stairs and landing head first on the marble floor.	For me it was the non emergency line and it was to get assistance for a noise complaint so that they can give me the info needed to issue a $100 ticket to the person who’s party it was as they would only give the info to the police.	1
Car got towed from my own parking lot even though I have a permit. I didn't notice for 5 days and now I owe $400 and they say I have to pay to get it back. is this legal?	Not a lawyer, but this is definitely a matter for small claims court. Talk to whoever is in charge of parking at your campus (make sure they didn't accidentally call them to tow your car specifically or that parking was banned for a certain time), take pictures of where your permit is located on your car, and see if you can find any free legal advice (online or in the phone book) on how to proceed. Most likely, the towing company will just give you your car back if you bring up taking them to small claims court, they could lose even more money for keeping the car from you for so long, let alone losing the $400. Again, not a lawyer, but that shit is what small claims court was made for.	The fact is that you parked in their lot without paying for it. Stop being a scumbag and pay up. And you should face academic disciplinary action for being such a douche about this whole thing.	1
Redditors that have been shot, what’s your story?	Something I can finally answer. I was shot the summer before high school during a July 4th party. We were lighting off fireworks in the evening when one of the neighbors, who was drunkenly upset, just decided to pull out a gun and shoot near the house. I got hit. Twice. After a week of hospitalization, a medically-induced coma, and a few surgeries, I survived gunshot wounds to my neck and back, fracturing a few ribs in the process. I'm basically fully healed now (that was years ago), but I can make my ribs crack in the morning if I take a deep enough breath.	I was once shot in one of my dreams. This dream occured 15 years ago and it's still a vivid memory of mine. At the time, I was 8 years of age. For an extended period of time, I was running away from the criminal until he eventually hit my heart. I experienced phantom pain for multiple weeks.	1
What was the greatest cliffhanger you've ever seen?	Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. I don't know what happens! There's like 3 different ways it could go down!	SPOILER ALERT GAME OF THRONES FANS -------------------------------------------------------------- Back in the day, before A Feast for Crows came out, I remember reading the epilogue for A Storm of Swords... When Lady Stoneheart hangs Brienne... Oh, fuck!!!!	1
What's your fondest memory from playing a video game?	Being eight years old, sitting with my dad, playing Command & Conquer: Red Alert waaaay past my bed time. It's also my favorite "don't tell your mom" moment.	I was a young lad playing Final Fantasy 7 on sega. After hours and hours of grinding we (a friend and I) finally did it! We bred our first golden chocobo! Sadly, i believe that was where i peaked. Aside from the birth of my daughter, i have never been as happy as i was when i got that damn golden chocobo haha.	1
What is an opinion you hold that is guaranteed to start a debate?	I'm dying and broke up with my ex rather than give her the choice of staying. Good guy or asshole, you decide.	I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion for this but, gay marriage isn't marriage. And transgenderism is a mental disorder.	1
[Serious]What's your in-laws from Hell story?	Husband committed suicide, in-laws took me to court over life insurance money. EDIT: Most insurance policies don't pay out in the event of a suicide, however SGLI through the military will pay out in almost all circumstances. Thank you all for the kind words! I am doing well these days and haven't heard from them in a few years! EDIT 2: TIL most policies WILL pay out provided policy is at least 2 years old.	My SO family get me thoughtful gifts for Christmas every year, and constantly tell me how I belong in their home and to not hesitate to fix myself some food if I feel hungry. Soon after i moved here my mother died, so the whole family got together for my birthday soon after to make me feel like I was wanted and still had a family. Jerks	1
Incest aside, what did you think all families did, only to find as you got older, was only specific to your family?	I grew up in a skiing family back in the days when most people still went to church regularly. We skied every Saturday and Sunday all winter long. I was about nine before I realized that church still happened during the winter. I had always assumed it stopped for the ski season.	I thought it was normal for everyone in the family to be miserable, to have an older sister who slapped me and called me a 'selfish bitch' every day, to have parents who hated each other yet didn't have any other friends, to have a younger sister who was better than me in every way, that is, until she developed an eating disorder. 30 years on, my Mum, my two sisters and I are all on antidepressants. It turned out that my older sister had bipolar disorder and my Mum had depression very badly when I was growing up with them. My Mum was a psychic Black Hole until she went on antidepressants 10 years ago, and now she is so much lighter ... Crap, I'm stoned and I'm rambling all over the place ... Tee hee!... Mandala kaleidoscope ...!	1
What is far easier than it looks?	Proving there was no collusion. Congress wasting money on investigation, bad. Should build the wall, more deals like healthcare, the best in the world!	Working out. You don't have to go in breaking records or keeping up with anybody else, just go at your own pace and increase from there. Been at it almost daily for 3 years now and I am glad that I have been.	0
[Serious] What is the most absurd thing that someone (or a company) owns because of a copyright or trademark?	The NFL actually has a trademark on the phrase "Super bowl". That's why when the super bowl comes around you see "Game Day" or the like when it comes to any promotions or bars talking about viewing parties	A genetic variety of corn. The problem is when nature does its thing, and pollinates other crops that are non-GMO, that farmer is committing copyright infringement, and has to pay royalties, or destroy their crop.	1
Poor people of Reddit, what are some remarks you secretly hate hearing from people that are not poor?	"I don't get it, why do you guys make everything in lire about money? It's just paper. I'd rather travel and enjoy life than spend 50 hours a week working" Guy who spent the last two years travelling around the world with his parents' money	My Brother's GF at the time (wife now) "Why is he buying shots? He doesnt have a cell phone" I like to drink, not to talk!	1
What is the worst thing you have ever found on another person's computer?	Back in my Geek Squad days: Computer sitting non-chalantly on the bench. Doing some sort of scan if I recall correctly. Screen saver comes on, rotating pictures of kids. We all assumed it was just the customers kids, until they started getting pornographic. Shut it off. Called the cops. No idea what happened after they picked up the computer. **tl;dr** Customer left his kiddy-porn screen saver on.	Going on my friends computer just to check my facebook. I type 'fac' and i see all these porn stites. FACIAL, FACE FUCK. Then for fun, i just type in 'asi' for 'asian' and i see all these asian porn hits, with videos such as 'asian make me creamy' 'asian likes it rough' ... oh wait that;s just my computer :(	1
Reddit, I think my house has been targeted by robbers. What do I do?	Get a case number from the police, get your home phone provider to put a trace on your phone line. Your phone provider will trace all calls, make a log of what time the calls occurred which day. Your phone provider will give this information to the police, and they can match it between your given times/days to figure who the calls are coming from.	make a sign that says "I've got a gun, so fuck off". then go to walmart and buy an airsoft gun and paint the orange tip over edit: or, when they call, answer with this: "I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you. "	1
What's the cringiest thing you've ever witnessed in real time?	A friend of mine wore a prom dress to our work at an insurance agency. A big blue sparkly ball gown. Whyyyyy?	The new kid in 6th grade. He showed up dressed in really cool clothes, but he just looked like a dweeb (had buck teeth). We all laughed at him within seconds of first seeing him, and all in unison we shouted "Dweeber dweeber, looks like a beaver! Dweeber dweeber, looks like a beaver!" And then I stood up and commanded the "infantry" to fire spitballs on my count. They fired round after round, just pummeling this kid. He ended up actually being really chill and by the end of the period we had formally accepted him into our ranks. Turned out he was just wearing fake buck teeth as a prank haha. Last year he was the best man at my wedding. But what we all did to him that day remains the cringiest thing I've ever seen.	1
What's the most Michael Scott thing your boss has ever done?	Not my boss but my older brother. We once got into a real fight because he wanted to stop me from taking a 9/11 conspiracy theory DVD to a friend's house to watch. He was worried because it was pirated and he thought of a cop found me with it I would be arrested and didn't want the CIA to think we knew too much. Honestly, I don't think this fits well with this thread but he's an idiot sometimes and I wanted to share. Also I didn't even believe the video I just thought it was fucking crazy and well put together.	Had an employee quit because the boss made him uncomfortable. Boss then pulls another employee into the mop room/closet to ask him if he makes him uncomfortable.	0
An alien race learns everything they know about us from the sims. What surprises them most when they meet us?	The fact that some people live in beautifully built homes that appear to be architectural miracles, while most others live in whatever can be scraped together to cover basic needs... So pretty much an accurate understanding of life.	"Shit, so the body just kinda lies there when you die, you don't get a tidy little urn? And you investigate these deaths too? This invasion is going to be more complicated than we expected..."	0
Just went to a sandwich shop on my lunch break. I had the hiccups while I was waiting in line when the guy before me turned around and asked me to "stop hiccuping" as it was distracting him from ordering. What is the most ridiculous request anyone has asked of you?	I was at a waterpark when I was maybe 12 or 13 with some friends. I was walking up the stairs to one of the water slides and was obviously holding the handrail going up. I guess my hand was still wet from just getting out of the pool (crazy, right?) and the guy behind me on the stairs told me to quit holding the handrail, I was getting him wet. My friends and I thought he was joking with us so we laughed. He gets pissed and tells the 18 year old lifeguard who just quietly says "I'm sorry, but it is a WATER park, you have to expect to get wet.".	I was talking to a friend of mine who works at Starbucks, after I'd gotten off work at the Starbucks across the street. I had a chew in, and was spitting discretely into a covered Starbucks cup. A guy waiting for his drink looked at me and said "Sir, I'd like to see you drink that." He was dead serious. Gave him my best shit-eating grin and went back to my conversation. Yes, I know I probably shouldn't be dipping in Starbucks, but my friend (a supervisor) and our manager (runs both of our stores) don't care as long as it's not while I'm working.	1
Non-Americans of Reddit: What is your opinion on root beer?	I love it! I first bought it simply because of its name. "Root" is Australian slang for sex. So "root beer" is a hilarious name for a drink to us. I drank it a lot while living over in North America too. Our equivalent is Sarsparilla.	Like Non all of the Americas or just the USA? Canadian Immigrant here. I hate Root Beer, it taste like Toothpaste in a soda. I have no idea what the fascination with this drink is. Its terrible. Also, floaters are terrible. Root beer with icecream! why!? EDIT: So over the weekend I tried Root Beer.... A&W and Barq. Sorry.. still as toothpasty as ever, and the after taste, oh God the after taste.. I wanted to take this time out to apologize for any root beer lovers i have offended, sorry I couldn't hop on this Float!	1
What do you think the buttons on Darth Vader's chest do?	The blue/green and red buttons switch between automatic and manual control of the life support systems. The bottom right button was a reset switch, the other 4 are programmable by the user. The 3 slots on the left are data ports for (from top to bottom) neural, respiratory, and pulmonary systems, and would be accessed for maintinence purposes. On his belt, the left box controlled respiratory functions and the right controlled temperature Source: *Darth Vader: a 3D Reconstruction Log*	I'd like to think they help him pee, poop, with easter eggs like a burp function and maybe a voice changer so he can sound like a wookiee or jar jar	1
What object, that isn't a body part, have you kept the longest without replacing that you still use to this day?	My dog tags. After having a very hard time with my coming out as ftm trans, my father got them made for me for Christmas the year we got my name officially changed. It was the first thing besides those documents that I ever had with my own real name on it. I wear them under my shirt/hospital gown/everywhere but the shower every day as an affirmation that I am who I am no matter what any bigoted asshole I encounter during my day has to say about it. It's not the longest thing, only five years old--I have other stuff that's lasted longer like my handmedown toasted and microwave--, but this is by far the most important and noteworthy.	My stapler is older than I am, I honestly am not sure how old it is but my parents have told me they've used it before they got their old house (roughly 40years ago)	0
To handicapped people. Are you offended when someones inquires about your disability?	Couple things. Lots of people find the word handicapped offensive. It stems from beggars who had their caps in their hands asking for money and really only applies to disabled beggars not a person with a disability. Lots of people are saying this but, it isn't a problem to ask about the nature of the disability when it is needed. It obviously isn't cool to be like..."Man, Ted, whats up with that broken spine of yours, can you...." But if you know a person may need help, or you will be responsible for them in some way you need to know the extent of their disability. Never help without asking if it is needed first. One should always let a person do the job that was set for them and this applies extra for people with disabilities who have been fighting the stigma of their helplessness for a long time.	I am personally disabled and have been asked 1000's of times how and why. It never bothers me. It is part of me and I don't feel any reason to be offended when someone inquires. Sometimes it's nothing more than a conversation starter and usually leads to entirely different topics in the discourse. People can be jerks but most aren't so I feel as in all walks of life, whatever a person can make fun of you for, they will if they are so inclined. I could be ugly, that would be much worse, j/k there, just showing what I mean.	0
My mother beat up a gang for me – what are your heroic/great mom or dad stories?	I was going on my first trip to Europe to follow U2 on their world tour. I spent my first night in Paris with a friend and we met a guy at the airport. He seemed nice at first but we didn't find out until it was too late that he was involved with some real shady human traffickers. They broke into the apartment I was staying in and took me away to be sold to the highest bidder. Just before they snatched me though I managed to call my Dad who promptly flew over from America and hunted down my kidnappers and rescued me. Edit: Well apparently people didn't like my Taken reference.	Grew up with an abusive mother. But my dad stayed with her until my brother and I were both old enough to be on our own. I thought that he was just too pussy-whipped to leave, so I asked him why: "I found out that most families who are in the military (my dad) go through a divorce, the one not in the service (my mom) gets the kids. I wasn't going to leave you alone with her." Bro-dad. EDIT: Wow, guys, thanks for all the wonderful comments about my dad. He's an amazing man in so many more ways than this and he is now (happily) divorced and dating a very wonderful woman who treats him like a king. My bro and I owe him everything. Also, TheWhiteBull posted some relevant information about divorce laws and active-duty members of the military if you are interested.	0
How do you disagree with someone without being a dick?	"Thank you for voicing your opinion. however, i want it to be known that i disagree with this opinion that you currently hold"	Don't be a dick about it. "I disagree" and your reason why would be fine for any rational adult. If the simple fact that you disagree with someone is enough for them to think you're a dick, that's on them and their delicate ego.	0
People who wear glasses, what's the thing you hate the most about wearing them?	Keeping them clean. 1) I have dandruff and it can get on my glasses leaving a speckled view makes me squint without realizing until I take them off to check. 2) My girlfriend is beautiful and I love her. She has an oily forehead so every time we hug or cuddle and she lays her head against mine, I take my glasses off because I know I'll see better without them for a little bit.	1. Loss of peripheral vision. 2. Progressive bifocals, makes it difficult to perceive changes in elevation (stairs, rocky terrain, etc). 3. Fogging up, especially when I'm hot and it's cold outside. 4. Trying to kiss my wife without getting smudges on them. 5. Finding them once I take them off, if I don't put them in the same place every night I'm screwed until someone wakes up and finds them for me. 6. I have long eyelashes, they constantly rub against my lenses and make them dirty.	0
In 8th grade I was Accused of drawing a penis on the ceiling of the bathroom even though I was barely 5 foot. What is the stupidest thing you've gotten in trouble for at school or work?	I "pantsed" a kid and felt bad about it. Went back a minute later, started apologizing, and the kid kicks me in the nuts. I collapse, my friend put my arm over my shoulder and is holding me up while the other kid goes and tells on me. I tell ya, nothing is right in the boys' high school locker room.	In 10th grade my math teacher and I had a mutual dislike for each other. On a day I was absent, someone in my same class signed out on the sign out sheet to leave class and wrote "fuck you" on the line underneath, complete with the date. I return the next day to the news that I was in In-School Suspension all day, as my teacher had reported that I was the one who signed out as "fuck you", presumably just because she disliked me. When I questioned it, I pointed out that all of my teachers, including that one, had marked me absent. The admin looked a little befuddled then said go back to class, which just happened to be the same math class by this point. The look on her face was one of pure disappointment and frustration.	0
Pretend that you are someone else trying to date you. What do you believe is your personal "red flag"?	I'm too mean. I'm not the touchy friendly type of person, and I'm very sarcastic so if you don't know me it can come off wrong. I try to turn it off but then I become very awkward and try to say nice things that end up coming out weird	I have anxiety and depression so I cry easily and a lot, and I couldn't deal with someone like that because its seen as a dirty tactic in fights. I have to leave and avoid my boyfriend so i dont hurt his feelings when I cry. Its manipulative if you cry in a fight, so I can't do it and have to leave when I start to.	1
Is there a way to actually IMPROVE your eyesight?	I heard that carrots are good for your eyes. But eating like 10 pounds of carrots every day don't seem like a good solution to me.	A common exercise is to focus on an object while it moves across your field of view and as it moves towards and away from you. This is often done by holding an object (pencil or other light object) with text on it in your hand and focus on the text to keep it in focus as you move the object in fromt of you. When outside, try to read the licenceplates of cars as they come closer and closer. The research on this show some improvement, however it is not clear if actually improve eyesight or if the subjects get better at "reading blurry things".	0
Children of actors or actresses what is it like seeing your parents on tv?	My aunt is a guest on Fox and Friends often. Even though I never watch it it’s still fuckin cool.	Both my parents are actors. I've been used to seeing and hearing them perform (theatre and radio) for my whole life. My dad has done voice work for some computer games. I was playing one once and he walked in the room and said "that chimpanzee is me" then walked out again.	0
Landlords of reddit, what's the weirdest discovery you made at a property after a tenant moved out?	I found out that a short black man, around 4'9", with a purple beard had been living with one of my tenants with out their knowledge. I stabbed him though so it's all good	Bathtub full of shit. Which initially made no sense cause, you know, why shit in a tub when there is literally a toilet right beside the tub? But then we open the lid of the toilet seat and the solid chunk of fetid, ossified shit clarified the issue. The toilet could not take any more shit.	0
What one trend or social norm needs to be brought back from the dead? What one needs to be killed?	The way we get jobs nowadays. It's completely messed up to see positions that pay $10/hr but you NEED to have 3+ years experience.	The way people used to dress with class. On that note, I would love for short shorts to go away, there's nothing pleasant about seeing people's butt cheeks.	1
What's the stupidest thing you've ever done to find out what would happen and what actually did happen?	I worked at a catering kitchen just out of college. We did a lot of sandwich platters, and I got to be designated meat slicing guy. We had one of those electric meat slicers like Kramer had on that episode of Seinfeld. Once, after cleaning, I wondered how sharp the blade was. I took every precaution: sanitized the blade, made sure it was unplugged, the whole deal. Then I very gently, ever so gently, as gently as any human has ever gentlied, touched my fingertip to the blade. Bad new is that it sunk to the bone almost immediately. Didn't even hurt, it was that sharp. Good news is that I got to go home early!	We put some of that poo powder they used to sell at Spencer's Gifts in my friends coffee. We felt so bad cuz he shit about 7 times in 2 hours!	1
What is your crazy idea?	A mustache trimmer with a built-in level, so you can see if you're trimming your mustache straight. I know what you're thinking - how do you know if you're holding your head straight? Well, that's why I also invented this level hat.	I'll probably get downvoted for this, but mandatory sterilization for people on government welfare. No permanent, mind you. Just some way to ensure that they dont have children so they get more welfare and the government doesn't have to spend more money on them. I've heard of a male birth control where you get a shot and you are still sexually active, just sterile until you get another shot to reverse the effects.	1
Have you ever used the handicapped stall only to come out and see a handicapped person waiting for you? What was the aftermath?	Yes. Dude gave me some angry side eye, so I responded with "Not every disability is visible, prick!" Note, I am not actually disabled, but he didn't know that, judgemental arsehole. Also to note, in the UK disabled toilets are locked with a special key available to anyone with a disability. I had stolen my friend's spare key.	Handicap stalls aren't reserved for handicapped people. They're simply available for them to accommodate various disabilities. Anyone can use them. It's not like handicap parking spaces where one needs a permit in order to use them.	0
What's the biggest "coincidence" you've ever experienced - where something extremely coincidental happened without any logical explanation behind it?	I was with my mom in the car and I was playing music from my phone. About halfway through 'Crank That' by Soulja Boy I got tired of the song so I switched it to the radio, where it played the exact same song at the exact part I was at on my phone.	Not that crazy but a few years back a long time neighbor moved away from the south to Massachusetts. Hadn't seen or talked to them since the move and while I was at a six flags in Atlanta me and my family ran into them. Turns out they were vacationing at the same time and we were both shocked that we happened to run into each other. What are the odds	1
I just found out my actions, when I was I was 5 years old, caused my father's death, but nobody bothered to share this fact with me until now. How must I feel about this? How would you feel about this?	I'm very sorry, but your dad gambled with cutting corners and lost, his death really has nothing to do with you.	A five year old can be held no more accountable for this than the car can. Face it, don't run from it, and move forward in humility and understanding that life is sometimes beyond our control.	0
What is a "social trick" you know of?	If you want to know if someone is actually listening to you, cross your arms. If they do the same, they're listening, and if they don't, their mind is elsewhere.	Let people do things for you when they offer. Let them loan you things, or make you food when they offer. If they offer you a drink and you're not thirsty, let them just get you some water to nurse. I used to think that I was doing the right thing by always declining people's offers, but it's really the opposite. If you can graciously accept things from people, they will be more comfortable and will like and trust you more. I once saw an explanation of this using Cognitive Dissonance Theory in *Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me)*. Not sure if I buy it entirely, but it sure does work.	0
What was your worst teacher like?	I was done with my work so I was reading some manga. He took the damn book out of my head and said I couldn't have it until the end of class. He was a douche who favored the preppy kids. It was a horrible geography class.	Our German teacher openly admitted that he grades students based on how much he likes them. He also said he tends to grade female students higher than male students for the same performance.	0
[Serious] People of Reddit who have been in a coma, what was it like? Were you conscious at all or were you completely gone? How did you get into the coma and how did you get out?	was in one for about 3 days. it was just like sleeping without a dream, except when i came out i was incredibly tired and immediately went back to sleep	I had a very serious head injury. I don't quite recall the specifics of the swelling, but I was out for a little over 3 days, they said. I woke up as if someone had turned a light back on. I immediately tried to get up; I thought I was still on the mountain I was skiing.	0
Bill Gates hands you a check for $5 million, but you have to put every last penny into charity/community improvement for the city/area you live in. How do you spend it?	I write a five million dollar check to the local food bank. If I'm not allowed to compensate myself for my time, I'm not doing anything with it that takes a lot of time or effort.	I would open a non-profit trade school. Contrary to what a lot of people think, there are indeed jobs available in this country. We need skilled plumbers, electricians, carpenters and HVAC techs. But to take this a step further, this school would not just focus on the manual skills necessary to do the job. It would serve as a business incubator with courses on accounting and money management as well as marketing and advertising. I'd like to be able to give the opportunity to run your own business to those who wanted to put in the work and learn how. There are a lot of folks who don't want a handout. They just need a hand up. I believe something of this sort could fill a need in many communities.	0
What is your first world problem(s) today?	It's warm enough outside so I don't need a jacket, but it's cold inside so I need a jacket 😧	Well, I don't have to my (one of the best in the state) high school until later because of testing in the lower grades. So here I am, laying in bed, listening to music, bored out of my mind, wishing I could get with this one girl in my English class, who I could never get with. Life doesn't get much harder than this, folkss	1
[Serious] What's the closest you've come to dying?	When I was a child I was rooting through the press and found a bottle of what i thought was 7-up...turns out it was white spirit...my sister grabbed it off me before I could take any...had the bottle up to my mouth any everything...mouth got all scourged and burnt...my sister saved my life	Just today I was almost in a head on car crash at a combined 100mph. Our cars passed each other about 2 feet apart. Luckily everyone stayed in their lanes through the motorway roadworks...	1
Reddit, what singular event changed the entire course of your life?	Hmmh. I think, as cheesy as it sounds, the creation of this novelty account of mine is probably going to be in the top 3 at the very least. Reading about and responding to people writing their day-to-day worries has been a very humbling experience and has pretty much become another recreational activity for me. I've grown to quite like just talking to people about problems I may have even faced in my own life at one point or another.	Cheating on my ex-boyfriend a few years ago. He found out and became abusive. When we broke up and I realized just how shitty he really was, I lost it. I never knew i was capable of hating myself so much. I had to be hospitalized for a week and spent the rest of my summer in outpatient care. I ended up doing poorly in school the following semester, and decided to work instead. Now I have a job that I love.	1
What episode of a TV show was the biggest fuck you to the audience?	The episode of Smallville that was sponsored by Stride gum (they all were, but it was super obvious in this one) . The gum was laced with kryptonite so it gave Pete stretchy powers. At the end Pete literally holds the package of Stride up to the camera and says, "It's kryptonite-free!".	Watching Walt spend 40 minutes trying to kill a fly. Edit: not saying it's not well written or not significant to the storyline, but to someone who hasn't seen the show and doesn't understand the context and implications of the episode, spending an hour watching the protagonist try to kill a fly is a colossal middle finger to the audience	1
What one simple thing, if gone, would have a drastic effect on your life?	My fingers. I think about it from time to time. They are *so* useful, but it is relatively easy to get them off of your hands. It's a scary thought.. It would change my life for sure.	Porn. And for the better. It sucks you in, and it changes how you see the world. It really sucks how it's such a huge industry.	1
What does the "hardcore" fan base of your hobby not understand about the majority, the "casual" fans?	That you can be a fan of a sports team and not know every single stat of every player. Or all the current team members.	The casual fans of playing an instrument decide it's not important to play your instrument correctly. They decide not to learn to read music. They think picking properly isn't important.	1
Redditors from the Middle East, what is daily life like in your country?	I live in the UAE. Honestly, not that different from what you'd expect in a Western country. Occasionally you see a mess of black fabric moving around, and (since this is obviously a Muslim country), you'd hear prayer at prayer times.	WOOHOO FINALLY RELEVANT! well kinda... Israel isn't your typical "middle east". but anyway, life is fine. Americans seem to think that you're being chased by terrorists all day long but its so far from that. in fact its ten times safer than the US. No oppression at all.	1
Christians of Reddit: What is a lesser-known verse or passage from the Bible that is beautiful or powerful or that impacts you whenever you come across it?	“Listen and understand. A man is not defiled by what enters his mouth, but by what comes out of it.” Mark 7:14-23 The parable explains that it's not what we put into ourselves that defile us, but what comes out of us. In other words, being a good person isn't based on what you watch, listen to, eat, drink, etc, but the resulting actions. For example, drinking wine or taking a certain drug isn't a sin *in and of itself*, but any actions that follow can be. And it makes a lot of sense too.	Tangentially, why do you not know that other religions have the same or similar verses or passages in their holy books?	1
What makes you uncomfortable?	Ninjas. By which I mean Muslim women in head-to-toe hijabs. They're the only people I refuse to assist. I always get somebody else to take over. I just will not deal with somebody who is actively working to support her own subjugation. It's idiocy (or institutionalization) on a scale I cannot identify with.	When people are behind me laughing. Even if they're not laughing at me I always assume they are during the situation.	0
What "fee" is 100% a cash grab/extortion that companies are charging?	Idk about the rest of you but the Pizza Hut by me has a delivery fee, a minimum delivery price, and on top of that they are finicky on tipping. Even to the point of giving me incorrect change and me havin to pull out the calculator on my phone.	When a retail store charges me for a debit transaction - I'm already paying bank fees to cover my side of the debit transaction. Seriously, accept the cost of doing business or move on. It really grinds my gears.	0
What is a red flag that you ignored because you didn't want it to be true?	Overly out going and friendly. Great to hang out with as a friend(get to do new things)... she will cheat on you	Not that I didn't want it to be true, I just didn't really think about it. Years ago I made a joke about my SO's family having a 'lemming gene' because they're seriously crazy accident prone. His brother was irate, thinking Id accused him of being suicidal. At the time I thought he was just defensive because he'd been struggling with depression, we didn't delve into it any further. He killed himself a week ago.	0
What is the weirdest sexual advancement someone has made towards you?	Several times throughout my life I had women throw themselves on me and kiss me. That is as sexual as an advancement you can get without actually falling on my dick.	It was sophomore year of college and I was in my room working on a problem set for my algorithms class when a girl from upstairs came into my room. We were friendly and all so I didn't think anything of it. She asked if she could get under the covers and I said sure. I kept working and she fell asleep. An hour or so later I finish my problem set and I want to go get dinner so I try to wake her up. I see a pile of clothes on the opposite side of the bed from my desk and i realize she is completely naked underneath my sheets. We had sex. Went out for 6 months after that.	0
What is something weird for a guy to do, but would be perfectly normal for a girl to do?	Having a Passion Party. Imagine a whole bunch of guys talking about sex toys and comparing which are the best to buy.	When I was in highschool I saw once accidentally walked into the girls bathroom into the cubicle even though I'm a guy.	1
My one of a kind ring was stolen a while ago and I just found a photo of a girl on Facebook wearing it. What can I do in this situation?	Do you have any proof it belongs to you? Calling the police and getting an escort to accompany you to retrieve it might be the best thing. Would teach them a lesson too.	Before you get the police involved (in which case, you can loose it for lack of evidence), as you say it isn't expensive, maybe try to buy it from her? I'd just send a message that I'd like to buy the ring and am willing to pay xx amount for it. Worth a shot.	1
Tech/IT people of reddit! What is the biggest mistake you've made at work?	We were testing out our new phone system and it appeared to let you set different hold music per site. So we loaded up Rick Astley for our hold music. A day or so later we're talking to several people on speaker phone at another site when they mute one of the phones they were using and suddenly.... *never gonna give you up*... The MD in the room got all snide about the stupid 80's hold music, the assistants are confused, and we are on mute laughing our asses off. So yeah, I rickrolled the hold music on our whole phone system. Might have to turn it into a yearly April tradition.	I used to work at a computer refurbish company. I was trying to install ram into a computer and forced it down and damaged a bunch of pins in the ram slot. I secretly swapped computers and ended up doing the same thing and had to tell a supervisor that someone before me ruined it and it was like that when I opened the computer.	1
Emergency phone operators of Reddit, what was the most non-emergency call you've received?	I have an old analog phone that I hook up to the phone line, even though I never get service. In the US, by law, 911 has to work even in a house with no phone bill. When I move into a new place, I always call 911 to verify that the phone line is working. It's never been a problem -- I quickly explain the situation and they confirm service and I hang up.	My father is a paramedic, and one night he had a call to a private residence around 2 in the morning. A man ran out and shouted for them to follow inside. When they did he led them to the bathroom, where he pointed at the toilet and yelled "my shit is floating! They never float!".	0
Is there a way to see how many viewers TBS loses when a Tyler Perry show comes on?	They obviously don't go down because if he didn't have such a large viewer-base, how would he get to make so many shows/movies?	In this thread: Rich white people who can't seem to comprehend other people might like other things that are specifically tailored to them.	1
Rosetta Stone just threatened me with 150k in fines and 5 years in jail for trying to sell counterfeit products, unless I pay them a hefty fine and sign all sorts of agreements. All of this from listing ONE unused Spanish program on Ebay. Help?	Do not sign anything from them. Do not give them anything. DO NOT EVEN CONTACT THEM AT ALL. Any contact with them will only hurt you. When you get served court papers, then you go lawyer up.	Ask them for a phone number so you can talk it through with them. Sounds like you're more a victim of possible piracy here.	1
What baby-name do you hear and immediately think, "You have fucking stupid parents"?	I have a niece named Sha-diamond and another family member named la-a(pronounced La Dash Ah) so my dynasty pretty much sucks.	Jamie Oliver's kids; Daisy boo, Petal Blossom Rainbow, Buddy Bear. I honestly believe that some parents don't consider the fact that their kids will one day grow up and perhaps they would like to be taken seriously in society.	0
What Stereotype do you break?	"People with OCD are neat freaks." Haha, joke's on you. My room is a mess, my desk is a mess, and most importantly, my life is a complete mess.	I’m 5’2, about 100 lbs, and I have a baby face and dimples. I like rock music, violent video games, and i swear alot more than expected.	1
What is your biggest "wait, why the heck did I do this" auto-pilot moment?	I used to deliver pizza and get super stoned while doing so. I would zone out while listening to music and totally forget where I was. I wouldn't if I was on the way to the house or back to the pizza shop. I would always start driving towards my house or something	Was filling up a salt shaker over the sink so I didn't spill any salt anywhere. As soon as I filled up the salt shaker I immediately turned it over and dumped all the salt in the sink. It was extremely deliberate and I have no idea why I did it.	0
While riding in car with my college girlfriend of 3 years and her family her father made me get out and walk home because I wasn't family. Reddit, what is the most awkward moment you've ever had?	If your girlfriend didn't throw up a HUGE protest or get out with you, then it's time to find a new girlfriend.	I once went to my girlfriends for Christmas in high school because my parents went on vacation. During dinner, her sister decides to announce, she's pregnant. She's a 20 year old, single college student. Who's the dad? My 27 year old cousin. They met at one of our family functions.	0
Do you wash new clothes before you wear them? Why or why not?	I usually do, especially if they're from a thrift store, because other people have touched them and I don't want their germs	I do, because one time years ago when I was getting a new pair of jeans I watched some guy have a sneeze fit. Then wipe his nose on the closest clothes rack to him, and blow it again. That moment will never leave me, and I'll wash everything.	0
Teachers of Reddit, what is the funniest thing that one of your students have gotten in trouble for where you had to pretend to be mad?	I once had a student (high school) consistently wear a large pop tart box on his head and proclaim himself the "Pop Tart King."	Easy. Last Friday... white boy goes off about BLM and how he has every right to use n**ger ... black girl tells him, (among other things) to take his casserole eatin ass and sit down. O.o #notmadatit	1
Mental hospital workers of Reddit, what's the craziest thing you've ever seen on the job?	I did my internship at a state mental hospital, about 11 years ago, there was a guy there who spoke mostly Spanish and was known for exposing himself to various women throughout the campus. He wasn't on my caseload, but he came to plenty of my groups and was polite to me and well-behaved. My last day at the hospital he walks up to me and hands me a crumbled brown paper bag and says he got something for me in his broken English. I was terrified to look inside, knowing his reputation and his violent history, but I peeked in and was shocked to see a small pink teddy bear. I still have it:)	Not a worker but a patient. The craziest thing I experiences during my month long stay was a schizophrenic teenage boy spend 2 hours trying to convince me he was a communicator between god and satan. He attempted to throw a chair at me when I told him "I don't give a fuck about you or your sky daddy. Shut the fuck up and take your meds like the rest of us."	1
Babysitters of reddit, what's your demon child story?	This is my time to shine!! I was basically minding my own business looking for a shaded spot to chill. Without notice or discussion a child was given to me from the Gods above. It didn't go to well, I'm dead now. :(	I had one main family I regularly babysat for after college and they recommended me to a friend of theirs who had two girls. Both families were well off, but very different. Anyway, the second family's two girls were beyond spoiled. I mean, TV reality show spoiled. The youngest, who was five, would blood curdle scream for a good 15 minutes running through this mansion house when it was time for bed. I always felt like an asshole calling the mother but they didn't pay me enough to put up with that bullshit. I'd have to set the girl up in the "special room" and rub her back while she fell asleep after she spoke to her mother. I sat for them three times and avoided their calls after that.	0
I met my wife when we both ditched out in the middle of the Prince of Persia movie. What small coincidences have changed your life?	My parents met when my mom was 16 and tried to sneak into a bar that my father bounced. Apparently they got into a huge argument, and their mutual friends set them up on a blind date a few months later as a joke.	I met my wife at a fundraiser for McCain/Palin we were both looking for a serious change in our country and communities, and clicked almost immediately. Now we are both working hard to campaign for Romney, only this time together! Edit: What? I'm not allowed to join in with the stories because I'm a republican?	1
People who have worked on horror movies, how scary (or not) was it on-set?	Not scary at all. In part because the movie was pretty shit and too this day still hasn’t fully released apart from a few festival screenings. But it was fun and I got to work with some semi-famous people (the brother of a really amazing actor and another guy who’s more famous to people in that specific role). But a lot of it because I was doing special effects and was helping create the scares so I knew exactly how fake everything was and knew that if they had just tweaked the shots in a few minor ways, all of the illusions we created would have totally shattered.	Not scary at all. Not only do you know what's coming but you have to do multiple takes of everything. Dying for like the 14th time really kind of takes the impact out of it.	0
What are some common ideas you hate, or find illogical?	"The customer is always right" Bullshit. And I'd like to stop having to pretend they are and be super kind to them when they are yelling at me, destroying something or generally being a dick.	the idea that mankind's greatest challenges can be solved by appealing to uncontrolled selfish greed. or capitalism as it is also known.	1
[Serious] What's some of the most fucked up parenting you've ever witnessed?	I've seen so many cases of parents buying their children stuff so the kid will shut up. Like you'll be out buying some food and the kid is screaming because he can't have 2 chocolate bars, and eventually the parents cave "Ok, if you'll stop screaming you can have them! You're making a scene" You know what you're supposed to do in that situation? Give him a clip round the earhole and tell him he's getting nothing for being a greedy pig. Kid wants to have a fit, leave him locked in the car while you finish shopping.	During my clinical rotation on a pediatric unit, there was a deaf and blind baby, being fed through a stomach tube. His mom's boyfriend had shaken the shit out of him, and his mom wanted to keep him alive so the boyfriend didn't go to jail. She hardly ever visited. When she did, she had no patience for the little guy. No warmth. It was so depressing. Peds, never again.	0
People who have hooked up with pornstars, how did it go? Did it live up to the hype?	I was in a relationship with a pretty successful ex-pornstar for about 2 and a half years. She told me on our first date while drunk at a club, but we didn't actually have sex for about a month after we started dating. Which was surprising. Edit: I realise I didn't answer your question. Yes, lived up to the hype. The girl was a sexual terrorist.	So not sure if this counts or not but I hooked up with a friend of a friend who was a camgirl a couple times years ago. I'm not sure if any of her videos are up anywhere anymore and she doesn't do anymore videos now. The sex was pretty vanilla though so that was a letdown	1
Pilots of Reddit, what is a scary experience that you had mid-flight that you did not inform the passengers about?	Most of my scary moments involve needing to go shit. We call back to the flight attendants and they tell us someone is in the lav. The FA's make an announcement telling everyone to remain seated. Someone else gets up in back and goes to take a shit. We make an announcement from the cockpit for everyone to remain seated. Someone else gets up and uses the bathroom. It's a vicious cycle. I'm up front just sweating trying not to shit my pants. I can see how much time we have left on the flight and how soon it is until we get to the zero hour when I can't really go in back due to the arrival. I miss my window to shit and now it's a half hour of me trying to focus on not shitting and also operating the aircraft.	My plane was hijacked once but luckily there were some snakes on it that bit the terrorists, just before i landed it on the river.	1
What is the thing you want to see most in your own lifetime?	I really hope that I get to see Betelgeuse exploding as supernova. The chances are slim, but there's no crime in hoping. Just imagine: one night you look out the window, and see that the horizon is unusually bright. Then, Orion rises. But instead of a reddish star that was Betelgeuse, you see an object as bright as the Moon. In fact, it would be visible in broad daylight. For several months. An awesome display of nature's power.	I want to be able to see Religion become a minority amongst people in my lifetime, however unlikely it may seem.	1
Dear gynecologist, how does it feel to be surrounded by vaginas all day and then interact with in a non professional manner? As it ever lowered your libido or made disinterested in someone?	Male OB/GYN here. As others have stated, it's all about compartmentalization. At work, I'm just a clinician and it's all business. You have to be able to separate your work from your personal life. If I didn't think I could do that, I would have probably ended up in a different field. Never a time where I would say it lowered my libido, but certainly, there have been cases where I silently gagged and thought to myself "oh god why!?!?"	Earlier today I was on the bus with my very hot girlfriend and some random beta male called me a pussy, so I literally got up and sexed my very hot girlfriend. Everyone on the bus clapped and another girl hi fived me. My name? Albert Einstein.	1
What should every new redditor do?	The upvote/downvote functions are not purely I agree/disagree buttons. Just because you disagree with someone's argument, if it's a well-written and an informed position don't downvote it to hell just because you don't share that view. Get involved in the discussion instead, and offer your own informed counter positions.	Be very carefull opening links to subs they're not familiar with while at work. Even if the name sounds innocent.	0
Bosses of Reddit: what is the most bizarre thing you've had to fire an employee over?	I once had to fire an employee for sucking his own dick in the washroom. I heard some strange moaning coming from the washroom so I peeked over the stall and saw him in full cock to mouth mode. What kind of person does that?	I used to manage an auto service center. One of my employees did a transmission service on a car, which started leaking badly when he was done. I went underneath to check it out, and he didn't bother trying to line up the gasket properly or anything. He basically forced the pan bolts through the gasket without lining up the holes. I berated him pretty good for doing such a crappy job while I pulled the pan and replaced the gasket myself. A little later on, I overheard him tell another employee that "that's a trick I learned in the Army... If you hate a certain task, do a really bad job at it and they won't ask you to do it again." I fired him on the spot.	0
Doctors and medical professionals of Reddit, what's the biggest lie you've told a patient?	Pharmacist here - "We don't have it in stock." For the following reasons: 1) Patient is showing behaviors of likely abusing the drug. 2) Patient comes in 5 minutes before closing. I refuse anything that's not a justifiable urgent need/emergency or not for a child in the last few minutes. If the script is for a kid, it isn't their fault that their parent is an ass-hat and waited to fill it. If you can justify the urgency/emergency then I will fill it. 3) Patient is just being rude to me or my staff. There are plenty of pharmacies out there if they really need it. Edited #2 to "justifiable urgent need/emergency"	Your family visited while you were unconscious. They were all so upset and said how much they loved you. They'll be back in a few hours. He passed before they came to visit at all.	0
Managers, what were some strange reasons for firing an employee?	I'm not a manager, but my preschool school director fired an employee on her first day because she put an infant outside, alone because "he was too loud."	Yes to both, it is part of the job and he read and signed a document stating that he understood it. But easy come easy go.	1
Have you ever told a small lie that eventually spiraled out of control?	When my sister and I were younger we used to set up our room like an obstacle course and play around on it. One time she fell on a rocking horse, hit herself right between the legs on some hard plastic. I was like "OMG PLEASE DON'T TELL I DON'T WANNA GET IN TROUBLE" because I was older, it was my game and my fault. Turns out she got internal bleeding from the injury and because she wouldn't tell what happened, they thought my dad had been sexually abusing her. She had to stay with my grandma for a week before I realized what happened and told the truth. It was horrible. We were both very young, I don't even think she remembers.	The biggest one I know of is when this woman called Mary had an affair on her husband but ended up pregnant with another man's child. She came up with this crazy plan to say to her husband that she "magically became pregnant" and that it was a 'miracle'. And the husband actually believed her! When my mum told me about this story ages ago I couldn't believe she got away with it. Anyway 2000 years later we have 2 billion 'Christians' knocking on our doors trying to tell us all about it.	1
What's a game you own that you like the idea of playing, but have never played it?	Pretty much any multiplayer survival game, there are so many and the concept is great, but I know it will never be what I want it to be	Civ V. It looks fun and I love the idea of Strategy games but then I get to my first turn and I get bored.	1
Redditors who moved from a third world country to first a world nation- What was the hardest thing for you to get used to or come to terms with?	I work in Uganda. Our sister organization sent a woman to America for her child to have a medical procedure done. She stayed in family housing on campus (like the Ronald McDonald House for St. Jude.) She said she felt utterly lonely because there was no community. People stayed in their rooms and kept to themselves, and she was extremely uncomfortable because she's always lived in a village setting. It was kind of mind blowing because we were all thinking we were sending her do be somewhere so amazing where she and her son would be treated like royalty. We lacked perspective in that.	US people have the "American exceptionalism' thing running around and think other countries are shit, while in fact, they themselves are just lucky. I cannot argue against them since they get, you know, number. So I go to Reddit and launch everything back. No wonder anti-american is trendy on reddit.	1
What made you do a 180 and change your life around?	The Red Pill. It taught me how to increase confidence, it lead me to meditation, fitness, Stoicism, gave me support. I will leave out gender relations as that tends to offend people. Disclaimer; I strongly advise you take everything they say with a massive grain of salt as they are often strongly over correcting.	My dad had a heart attack in his 50's and he was in marginally better shape than I was in my late 20's. I was fat and I needed to change if I was going to live. It's take me a while to turn it all the way around, but I'm almost there at 35. My dad is fine and is 64, for those curious.	0
What made you happy today?	One of my friends that I hadn't talked to in a while texted and asked if I was doing okay	Found out that one Trump lady who was violating Mosques with her children was arrested. In the video she was literally teaching her kids that Muslims were terrible rapist who worshiped the devil. The eerie part is you can hear the little kids say stuff like "Be careful you know Muslims are waiting for a chance to rape you." "Probably a lot of goats in there that they rape." They say it so happily too while vandalizing the Mosques..	1
Biggest scandal that has happened in any of your schools?	When I was in high school, a kid got busted paying a girl $10 to give him a blowjob. They were under the bleachers in the gym before school had started, where half the student body was waiting for classes to start. We also had another kid jack off inside/under his windbreaker during the GHSGT (Georgia high school graduation test). He got caught because of the windbreaker making this "fsh fsh fsh fsh fsh" noise. When people started looking around it got all, " fssshh... fssshh..."	We had a homosexual teacher get busted with child porn on his computer at school. He was a great teacher but clearly had some issues of some sort.	1
What is your version of, "I used to walk 5 miles to school, barefoot, in 2 feet of snow" for younger generations?	I use to have to use the phone at the school to call my mom if I wanted to hang out with my friend after school.	If I wanted to call my high school boyfriend, I had to call his house and risk talking to his mother first.	0
Dear reddit, I used to wake up look over the border/river and smile because I saw Mexico. Now I wake up and see smoke and go to sleep to the sounds of gunfire. What are somethings that have changed that make you sad to realize?	That the situation with the cartels is entirely preventable, along with the incentives to imprison American citizens due to an increasingly profitable privatized prison industry. It's not about justice, or about rehabilitation. It's about creating cheap slave labor that will *willingly* come back to you, because criminals are coerced to go further down the rabbit hole with very little advancement (if any at all) working an honest 9-5.	Growing up, I used to be able to look at the night sky and see the Milky Way, in just this huge, glistening river across the sky. It made you feel soo....overwhelmed...and in awe...and tiny! The other day I was at a planetarium and the announcer said that even in rural areas, many children have grown up either not seeing it at all, or only dimly seeing. Surely enough, when I visited my childhood home, it was just the barest glimmer up there... So damn sad. :(	0
What's the most awkward thing you've ever seen happen at a wedding?	There was a homeless guy that showed up at my aunt and uncles wedding. He was coughing up a lung and smelled, and my other uncle, who was the grooms brother, said very loudly, "Must be from the brides family."	The designated stabber stabbed a pregnant women, and the husband didn't even try to run. And his mother got killed aswell. Cool song tho	1
Dog owners of Reddit, what was it like when you first met the dog you were going to share your life with? Did you have to choose? How did you know that dog was "the one"?	He was the runt of the litter and the only one without a stripe on his back. We took him home and he was just as perfectly awkward as all of us it was a perfect fit	My boyfriend and I went to the shelter to pick up a dog we had picked out a week earlier. When we got there, the shelter told us we couldn't adopt him because he had started a fight with another dog so they had him in isolation. We were bummed, but determined to give one of those animals a good home. We started walking around checking out the dogs available and we came to one named Ernie. When we saw him, and he saw us, he immediately walked to the front of the kennel and put his butt up to the chain link to let us know he was ready for butt-scratches. As gay men, we were very familiar with this type of attention-seeking. We took him home and he's been with us for three years now. None of us could be happier with the decision.	0
What's a sad or dramatic movement in a sitcom or comedy that made you really feel something?	On Scrubs when Dr Cox had the Rabies organ donor and was responsible for three deaths. His meltdown at the end still gets me.	The Fresh Prince of Bel Air during the scene when Will's father promised to take him with him on a trip and then promptly left with an excuse of something else he had to do. Will goes on a spill about how he taught himself everything a father should teach a son and he has done fine then starts actually crying. His real life father had abandoned him as well. Uncle Phil then grabs him and hugs him. Later on.. we find out the hug was totally improvised and was just one actor helping another actor. Broke my heart. Edit: I was misinformed on Will not having a father growing up. So sorry.	1
What’s your most r/thathappened moment you’ve ever experienced that actually happened?	When I was in high school I would occasionally take day trips to Indianapolis with my grandmother. While looking through a bookstore during one trip, I came across *Looking for Alaska*. I made an offhand comment about why someone would name their character Alaska, and a guy a bit down the aisle kinda laughed at me. I said it's weird, and he just kinda shrugged and walked off still laughing some. Later the next week my history teacher played a Crash Course youtube video, and I recognized the guy as the guy in the bookstore. It was John Green. I made fun of his character to his face and I'm still horrified.	2015 I started dating a woman who looked a lot like Alexis Ren (google her), just... my gf was better looking and with a better body than Alexis Ren. We had an 18-month relationship, and we both knew that it was going to be short term, it actually lasted longer than we thought it would last.	1
What did you do as a kid that made you a huge pain in the ass?	I was a button pusher. Tried to make people mad, see what kind of reactions I could get out of them. Actually, I still do that..	-I would hide my Mother's cigarettes or break them. Once I put them all filter side down in a potted plant. -Every time I broke something in the house I assembled it the best I could to make it seem like the next person who touched it broke it. -I refused to eat anything with onions.	0
How did you almost die?	My math teacher wouldn't open the window in our very stuffy classroom. This induced a asthma attack and she denied me going to the bathroom because she thought I was faking. 3 hours later I came round from an asthma attack, being told I was hanging by a thread.	2 times. Friend forgot what his gun loaded then we took picture. Another time we were drunk and i was on car roof. Fried forgot about me and started speeding, then fast stoped. Fuck. I have shit firends.	1
Redditors ages 25+, what/when was your first "kids these days" moment?	When I became a school teacher at 25. I was so used to hanging out with people my age. Then all of a sudden I was teaching students around 12-14 y/o. Stark difference. Definitely had a lot of 'kids these days' moments.	When my younger cousin texted me to check out this funny show they just uploaded on Netflix..... It was Friends	0
To the people of reddit, are you happy?	I suffer from undiagnosed depression which I am 'treating' with Cannabis because to actually go to a doctor, be diagnosed and receive a prescription would result in my chosen career path, for which I have worked hard and sacrificed pretty much everything, no longer being available to me. My mental illness, in the eyes of society, would deem me unfit to do a job which I am passionate about, and am committed to doing better than many of the individuals I have seen in that role, who do it half-assed and take it for granted. And my depression is getting worse. So I'm not the happiest camper out there.	On the surface, I am happy. Most of the time, I am happy. When I am with my friends, I am happy. When I drive to work, I am happy. When I am running, I am happy. But every couple days I am crippled by an overwhelming feeling of depression for a few hours. For the life of me I can't figure out how to make it go away.	0
What is the best news humanity could possibly get right now?	Lula is free, Sanders is POTUS and the queen takes control of the government reverses Brexit and puts Corbin in charge. All this news causes Moscow Mitch to have a heart attack. While everyone's head is spinning, someone at Reddit HQ deletes T_D and bans everyone who participated in it.	The aliens are here, and they're disappointed, just like our parents. And just like our parents, they're going to bail us out of our mess ***just this once...***	0
Straight People, what do you want to ask about the LGBTQ+ community that you wouldn't ask in real life?	Why do you constantly feel the need to tell me your sexuality? That’s such a small part of who you are but you seem so fixated on it when everyone else is ready to move on	I have a colleague, colleague has a female name but looks (hair, physically, voice and work uniform provided by the company) are male. Colleague also has a girlfriend. I usually address colleague by name, but we are not that close to ask wich pronoun is better to use. Should I ask? Or just keep calling by colleague name? We are not on the same area, but work close. Edit: colleage to colleague. Thanks for the correction! English is not my first language. Edit 2: Oh I’ll be listening the pronouns their friends use and copy that (we speak spanish, so we don’t have neutral pronouns). Thank you all!	0
I'm a gay male who hates window shopping yet about half of the women I meet assume I want to go shopping with them. Reddit, for what are you wrongly stereotyped?	I'm from Northern Ireland. Belfast, in particular. I've never actively taken part in a riot, and I don't really care if you're a Prod. As long as you like whisky, we're all pals.	I have dreadlocks so I must smoke copious amounts of marijuana and love Bob Marley. Don't get me wrong, both are fantastic, but it certainly does not define me as an individual.	1
What is truly the most BORING job ever?	Loss Prevention at Best Buy. You stand at the front of the store in the open monitoring cameras. You are required to say "Hello" to everyone walking in, and "Goodbye" to everyone leaving. And you are not allowed to leave your post.	One that I would think is boring but I've heard isn't: Pilot. I mean, the planes fly themselves, so other than take off or landing you don't really do anything but sit in the cockpit. But a pilot told me that it's actually a pretty fun job all things considered.	1
Redditors who went to school with now porn-stars, what were they like?	Grew up in a smallish town with Kira Lynn (not her real name, of course) She was nice enough. She ended up working in basically the town's only strip club, but rumor has it that she quit when her older brother walked in and caught her. Then I worked with her after high school. I'm about 98% sure that she's the one who stole money from the restaurant office, and a guest's purse all in the same day. (2 days before Christmas) I believe it was because of drugs because she ended up having a pretty serious drug problem before starting to do porn. Pretty standard stuff, I assume.	Went to school with Bonnie Rotten (not her real name, of course). She was a cheerleader, not very likeable, a few friends who were pretty bitchy as well. Not a fan of her back then. But now....	0
Do you sleep naked? Why or why not?	I always prefer to be naked, I get super hot so it's easier to cool off. However, having kids means random staring and crawling in bed at 2 am means I have to adopt a new lifestyle. Also my wife didn't like the pokies. Edit: obligatory my top comment on Reddit is about poking my wife in the rear. We did it!	Clothed, I don't sleep naked simply because of something I was told once, but I have no idea if it is true an I can't be arsed to spend the 5 seconds it would take to google it. Basically I was told that hair can re-root iself. So if you sleep naked then any hair that falls off can root itself back into your body easier. Which means you get really hairy backs and stuff.	1
Technology savvy people of reddit: what is something that the average person doesn't know about cell phones that would probably greatly benefit them?	If you plug headphones into your phone, no one else has to hear you shit music. Works like a charm.	As well as using it to check Reddit, post to Facebook, take photos, send SMS messages, check email, navigate, listen to music... you can use it to make phone calls.	1
US Redditors who have lived in multiple regions (ie North, South, Midwest, etc), what difference stood out to you most between living in there areas?	The number of people in the South who wear their Christianity on their sleeve is shocking to us Northerners. I could never live in the South again. Neighbors and co-workers thought nothing of imploring me to attend church or even worse visit their church. Plus all the religious pronouncement a throughout the day. Enough already. Give me the secular, rational North any day.	I went to college in southern California. It was as laid back as you might imagine- everyone wore shorts and a t-shirt with sandals (I used to not be a sandal person, but then I realized I was literally the only one wearing shoes). I did a semester in DC. Before it started, there was an info session talking about what to expect in DC. They literally had to tell people not to wear shorts to an official function.	0
Ate alone at a restaurant for the first time last week. And it wasn't even that bad. Reddit, what things did you think would be awkward to do until you actually did them?	Going to a bar alone and the movies alone. I always thought people would look at me like I was a loser or something but, in reality, no one gives a shit.	Ooooooooo, somebody ate alone. Fucking daredevil. Seriously, what a charmed socially-secure life you must lead. That's the first time that's ever happened? I thought incest would be awkward but then it was awesome.	1
What thoughts do you keep to yourself, because you think nobody else would understand?	How much I think about being a person. Like when you think about it you are seeing out of your eyes but you dont realize you are a person in a sea of people. It hits me every now and then, like I woke up in a body. I dont know how to explain it ughhh	That I should be paid more than my female coworkers. There is no part of our job that they can do that I can't, but I can pick up a box of paper.	1
What unconventional physical features do you find super attractive?	My wife's nose. She has a big hang-up about it, and really wants to get plastic surgery done on it. It's a little large, and has a good bump on it. I always found that attractive, and have told her that many times, but she still thinks it ruins her face, and desperately wants to get a nose job.	I've always liked thick thighs on a girl. Not like extremely fat thighs that are super jiggly and/or full of noticeable cellulite, but mostly well toned. You don't even have to be a leg day gym nut about it.	1
Redditors who have been married or in a relationship for 15 or more years: how's your sex life?	130 comments? Just getting started. This will provide some great reads, and good advice perhaps, as time goes on. Hot shit.	Married almost 14 years, together almost 18, with two children currently under age ten. We average a couple of times a week, though this week we did better than average. :)	0
What is something you grew up with that you didn't realize was regional?	Every Friday during the warm months my neighborhood would have a fish fry were everybody brought the various fish they had caught that week. If you didn't fish you were required to bring beer and brats instead. I realized not everybody did this when I was visiting family in New England and commented that nobody in our family had gone fishing to prepare for Friday.	I didnt realize that lots of the country doesn't have quick and easy access to really nice quality wine. It baffled me to find out how many people are content to drink wine from a box	1
Parents of Reddit, do you find your kids ugly?	Not a parent, but my Grandma will openly let you know that her eldest son is the ugliest of her children. She says when he was born and she first saw him she thought "What an ugly baby".	My kids are freakishly cute. Like, a stranger will comment ONLY on my kid in a group of children. No idea where they got it from.	1
Gamers of reddit, what game will make you laugh for hours with just the gameplay?	Transformice. I've been playing it for about two days and it's fucking hilarious. The people on the game are saltier than the Pacific Ocean and are more butthurt than my hemorrhoids. I just go on there to troll and fuck with the players and laugh when they get angry. Edit: A close second, Shower With Your Dad Simulator 2015.	Honestly, Just Cause 2 because the things you can do in it are just so ridiculously absurd. Wanna fly a 747 into a bad guy's base and parachute out at the last second shooting your machine guns at all the bad guys? Fuck it, go right ahead.	0
AskReddit has 2 million subscribers! How can we improve the subreddit?	Some variety would be interesting, but I'm not sure how that could be accomplished. I love AskReddit, but sometimes it feels as though there are only cycles of the same questions, just slightly reworded.	I would like to see a daily "how do you wipe your ass?" thread. That is one topic that needs to be talked about more often than it currently is.	1
People who actually love their jobs; what do you do, and what made you decide to go for it?	I was a drug addict and hit rock bottom, i needed to find something i enjoyed to distract me from doing drugs. I started cooking and baking and researched increasingly advanced recipes to make, and i found that working with my hands and producing something beautiful was so much more fulfilling than getting high. I just completed my level 1 culinary apprenticeship and am on my way to becoming a red seal chef.	I work at a college as a janitor even though I feel like I'm smarter than most of the people who go there. Sometimes I see an equation written on a blackboard like half an equation and... I just figure it out	1
What strange things did you experience as a child that was written off as 'just your imagination'?	Every night I would get up and go to the toilet when I would turn around down the other side of the hall would be a solid black dog with no features but I always felt like it looked to be a Labrador nearly every night I would wake go to the toilet see the dog and go back to bed once I got the courage one night to walk down the hall and try to pet the dog but it vanished straight away to this day I have not seen it since	I was around 4 or 5 years old and shared a room with my younger sister. She was still an infant, and was fussing one night. I was getting annoyed with her because she was keeping me awake. I decided that I was going to get up and get my mom when my mattress lifted up, then dropped back down. It felt exactly like someone adult sized was under my bed and used their hands and feet to push my mattress up. I was too scared to even call for my parents after that. Nothing else happened after I was lifted and dropped, and after what felt like an eternity, my mom came in for my sister. I told her what happened, and she reassured me that I was dreaming, but I never believed her. I was awake, and something was under my bed.	0
I'm temped to poop in my cat's litter box - what weird temptations do you fight?	I have to try my hardest not to plow my yellow VW beetle through a line of traffic cones and pretend I'm Mrs. Pacman.	I want to fuck a pie, and then feed it to my family and friends, on thanksgiving, and say the cum is cool whip.	1
Guy of reddit , whats your most girly secret?	Sometimes, I enjoy being the "little spoon" with my wife. I'm a large human, former D-1 Football Offensive Lineman 6'5 300 lbs. She thinks its adorable. Sometimes you just need a good snuggle.	I guess not really girly, but not socially accepted as manly, but my heart. Ive so far been with just 1 girl intimately amd she has since broke up with me. I feel disgusting, like ive been raped. She knew what it meant to me to have just one woman. To be dedicated to one girl that id get to call my wife. And she said she agreed. But now this happens. I feel like she stole that right from me. Now i have to go on and learn to trust again. And even still, i have to learn to let someone else have me. It feels horrible. I only wanted her. ONE woman. No other. And now that chance is gone. Fuck i hate myself for letting that happen.	1
What happened to all the "reddit celebrities"? There was a time when it felt like every front page post had a top comment by one of the bigs, but they don't seem to be around anymore. Was it just a phase, and have there been other reddit phases like that through the years?	I think after what happened with violentacrez a lot of them will be lying low in case they rub someone up the wrong way and have their personal details made public. To be honest I don't blame them, violentacrez may have been involved in some of the more reprehensible subreddits but he didn't deserve to be dragged through the media like that.	They stock up on much-needed karma and hibernate for the next few months until they emerge from their dens, which usually happens in late April.	0
Fathers of reddit, what is the best way you have messed with a daughters boyfriend when meeting him?	Not a father but an older brother. When my sister was in middle school she brought home her first boyfriend to watch a movie. I sat behind them and sharpened a hatchet the entire time. My family also got into a huge family "debate" while he was over. They broke up soon after	idk the first thing my ex's Dad said to me was "you can sleep in my Daughters bed tonight." and I replied "thanks, you too" because i was too nervous.	0
What is the weirdest dream you've had?	I went cliff diving and ended up hitting a rock on my way down, but instead of blood, silly string sprayed out and a bunch of people gathered around my dying body to have a dance party.	If I'm dreaming right now and when I make up and check reddit. I'll read this comment I made and that would be the weirdest dream	1
What is something you always do that others find really unusual?	After watching the movie, I read the plot on Wikipedia, its reviews on imdb and watch its trailer. Every single time.	I pick fuzz off fuzzy blankets and roll it into balls. The firmer, the better. I do it constantly, and have hidden little stashes of fuzz all over the place: coat pockets, jean pants, my bedside table, the little money storage cup in my child's stroller... I cannot really explain why I do it or what joy it gives me, but I know I've been doing it since very early childhood (my blankie, or "nana" as I called it, was a fuzzy blanket that I'd picked completely threadbare).	1
Non-American black people of reddit, have you ever encountered black Americans or visited America and witnessed black culture? If so, what are your thoughts?	Oh hey. Is it time for the weekly "Reddit, make up a story to justify my racism"? And just in time for the weekly /r/news "Look at these fucking apes protesting in the streets" thread.	Yes. I am a non-American black female, and I have been living in the U.S for a few years now, so I can share some experiences with you...not sure if they align with exactly what you're looking for!	0
I always hear "Don't worry you're young and will find someone." Reddit, at what age did you meet the person you married and at what instance did you know they were the one?	That quote is such bullshit. If you can't get any now, why the hell would you be able to get any when you're older and uglier?	Not married yet. I don't call her 'the one', that just feels obsessive and clingy. But she was my closest friend for years before we took it further five years ago. We basically held each other up through failed relationships and then when we both found ourselves single, we took the chance. Five and a half years and the fire is still strong. We're a team, we developed our bond holding each other up when we were in our darkest moments. We knew each other at our worst before we even started dating. Next weekend is my 30th birthday. I never ask for anything for my birthday, I don't feel comfortable getting gifts. This year's gonna be different. There's no greater gift I could want than what I'm gonna ask for.	0
What is the smallest thing that you saw someone get angry about?	My Dad had serious anger issues when I was growing up, so I saw a few. The worst I can remember was when he shouted the whole house down for a few hours because a shoe had fallen off the shoe rack.	I left my bike outside the garage instead of putting it back in. So my dad beat the shit out of me. It is my first childhood memory.	1
[NSFW] Truck drivers and long haulers, what's your craziest lot lizard story?	Never seen one in my experience, but I heard this story from a fellow trucker. He saw another guy put on a wig then go around the lot trying to suck as much dick as possible.	Pretty sure this kind of thing is dead or almost there, why take the risk of walking around a rest stop / truck stop when you can just advertise on any number of escort sites and find customers, far safer and less time wasting.	1
What is a seemingly insignificant thing that your SO does, that makes you love them even more?	If I'm having a bad day, he'll put on my favourite love songs and ask me to dance. We can't really dance, but that's what makes it so uplifting. That's one of the things that still gives me butterflies 3 years in.	My significant other sleeps at the same time, watches the same sports as me, eats the same food as me, we are together 100% of the time, we both work in finance he's just brilliant... oh wait - my significant other is me.... worlds smallest violin plays for me...	1
Why do europeans hate gypsies so much?	They stole my aunt when she was 4. She was gone 2 days before my mom who was 12 at the time found her sitting, made up to look like a "native" in the lap of an old lady. Needless to say they were run out of the village my family lived in(former yugoslavia)	There are millions of gypsies. A significant portion behave as described in this thread, but they do not deserve to be saddled with this stereotype. Just substitute <your-favorite-race-to-hate> in any of this threads comments and hopefully you'll get that uncomfortable feeling. It is the thieves and beggars that behave this way, not the gypsies. The actual number is subject to dispute, but during WWII, anywhere from 250,000 to 1,500,000 gypsies were killed along with the Jewish population. This is where this hatred leads.	1
What piece of advice would you give the teenagers of today?	If someone fucks you over or lies big time they'll do it again, even if you're a good person to them.	The STEM circlejerk exists for a reason. If you insist to go to art school, use your time there to learn something artsy that is also technical (like architecture, or 3d modling).	1
Would you support a federal law requiring all law enforcement to wear a camera when on duty in light of recent events?	Yes. It protects both parties. I also remember reading a statistic stating that complaints against violent cops went down when cops wore cameras. It was in an article where a cop who murdered three people magically had "camera failure" all three times.	No more than I would want cameras watching everything I do. The freedom to do what is right goes hand in hand with the freedom to do what is wrong and deal with the consequences.	1
Do grades motivate us to learn? or do they distract us from the purpose of learning?	One aspect of "testing" this made me think about is test anxiety. Why do students develop test anxiety? Most likely, it's probably not because they're worried that they don't know the material, but more because they're worried about "failing". Come on, we've all done it, we've all gone into a test and completely messed up something fairly easy because we weren't thinking about the problem, but about the test.	I don't see how that would work on things like essays. How would you know what to improve? When reviewing past tests, how would you know what you need to study? And besides, there's nothing quite like acing a test that everyone else fails.	1
War veterans of reddit, do you find it difficult to play video games that simulate combat?	Just a little. Only since I have had the time to play them all day every day for years like some of the people I know. O.o you know who you are.	Not a bit. I actually like them a lot, until I realize it's 2 am and I have to leave for work in 4 hours. My real gaming passion is RPGs though, I love solving problems and completing tasks.	0
Once while delivering a pizza, I called the police to report a case of child abuse/neglect on a customer. I have no idea how it turned out and it drives me nuts! What are some of your stories without endings?	One time, I took a dump and flushed it, and never saw it again. I'll miss you, Trudy "the turd" Peckham.	My Dad was driving home from work and saw an accident on the side of the road. He pulled over to help and saw a middle-aged man FREAKING out, pacing back and forth, saying things like "What am I going to do? What happens now?" etc... Dad notices a little boy, laying on the ground, barely alive. Dad takes off his shirt to try and stop the bleeding while trying to calm the man down. Tells the man that his son doesn't need to see him like this. Little boy dies in my Dad's arms. Police show up and ask my Dad a few questions. They take the man away in cuffs and my Dad heads home in tears.	0
What do you need to get off your chest Reddit?	I have some doubts regarding my mental health, but I am sort of afraid of finding out what exactly is going on. I do not experience a "stable" mood very often. I bounce around randomly between extreme highs and lows. EDIT: Thank you all for the advice and kind words. I will take it all into consideration and start making an "action plan" today.	Fuck you, you're whats driving our class and the Junior class apart, you're a giant douche, who can't keep his own damn mouth shut and out of others peoples business. Man to think I thought of you in a respectful way at some point.	1
Who doesn't hate their job, why and what do you do?	I love my job. I am a chiropractor and I help people overcome pain and mild to moderate disability in relation to injuries to the back, legs, and neck. It is very rewarding and people are very appreciative of what I do for them, in fact one patient gave me a gift card for Christmas and home made cookies just yesterday.	I am a general office guy and IT technician at an eco friendly, woodland burial site. And i love my job! Basically we plant a tree for the deceased instead of a head stone. There is no religious overtones and it is open to everyone of any faith. Its a fascinating place that is really enjoyable to work for.	0
You’re given one statistic that would hover above anybody you see. What would you choose?	How many people hate this person. Would be interesting to get to know what's the reason behind it if someone has a high number.	How easy to manipulate out of ten. If someone was a perfect ten you could get to know them a bit and then get them to do your bidding wherever and whenever.	1
For the next 24 hours, every single person on the planet will be trying to find and kill you. You are given a 30 minute head start. What is your plan?	Like id tell you and a bunch of other peole who are trying to kill me what id be doing	As always, too vague. &#x200B; Does everyone know how I sound and look? Does the head start mean, that noone follows me, but they can still see where I leave to? If you drive down the highway, for 30 mins, and people see you taking off to the highway, your chances are severely slimmed down, because a thousand people can keep driving as far as they can get in 30 mins, and then disperse and do a reverese and forward search, which will get you found super quickly. &#x200B; If noone knows how you look, and sound ,the chance of them finding you is severely reduced. &#x200B; So yeah. Got to love these questions without specific input.	1
U.K. Redditors: how do you feel about the passed bill on internet censorship?	I'm sure not many people are going to agree with me on this, but I believe internet usage should be considered a public domain. I do think it needs to be heavily regulated and I don't think it's regulated enough.	Absolutely disgusted. I usually try to elaborate on my opinions, but I really have no words...I'm just disgusted. Our government is a joke.	0
People who love what they do for a living: what do you do and what was your path to obtaining your job like?	I'm a psychic. Yes, a real one, Yes I make my whole entire living doing it and work every day. I work with high profile people, celebs etc. It is a gift that I inherited. My twin sister has it too, but doesn't use it professionally .	Conductor (classical music) Worked my ass off in college and grad school. I study constantly. Music is one of those professions where it's not only your job, it's a passion / hobby / stress reliever / stress inducer.	0
Reddit, what is your weirdest hotel story?	My brother and my dad were staying in a hotel in Chicago. We stayed on the 17th floor and my dad was in a meeting somewhere downtown. My brother and I ordered room service and right when it came the fire alarm went off. We had to shuffle down the stairs, to the lobby. Somehow the hot tub caught on fire and set off the alarms.	I once stayed in a hotel where the sheets had cigarette holes, period blood, and were caked with dried semen. I mean all hotel sheets are covered with semen but at least usually they try to wash it off a little.	1
What is the scariest nightmare you ever had that still bothers you?	Random things start exploding. Myself and family start running away. Hear a LOUD Microsoft Windows "error" sound. Look at sky. Windows dialogue box pops up in sky with error message. Everything starts going black and I wake up.	A couple of years ago, I had two sleep paralysis in a period of three weeks. That was particular! I'm not scared per say, but because of the strange nature of the experience I documented myself quite, and now when I tell the story of what it is and what happened, I always end up having a chill down my spine and goosebumps. Just a reaction to the threat sleep paralysis conveys. Pretty neat :D	1
What's a subject redditors are just too damn uptight about?	Suggesting that there are biological differences between men and women, and people of different races. Does having genetic differences mean that people of one gender or race are better / worse / smarter / dumber / etc, than another gender or race? Of course not--such judgments would be a gross oversimplification. But, suggesting that society is responsible for all differences between people, and that biology has no effect is a similarly gross oversimplification. If we can agree that a person is a mix of nature and nurture, both mentally and physically, why does it become offensive to suggest that this assertion holds true for a group? Obviously I'm not advocating racism or sexism, but I do think it's important to acknowledge and study our differences.	Circumcision. No matter what side the post is supporting, the other side comes out and jumps on their dicks. Don't you fucks even think about fighting about it under this comment. Surely you have subreddits for that.	0
What fictional object do you most want to own?	That magical tent from Harry Potter Goblet of Fire, I could live anywhere in the world with a small tent on my back. Travel everywhere, but live in comfort. And the best part is, no mortgage, no payments, and most people wouldn't try to steal it. I'd have money to do with whatever I please. My husband and I would travel forever.	a goddamn duplicator so i could duplicate some goddamned large bills. and weed. smokes. fuckin' cans of gas. c'mon, y'all are slippin'.	1
Attractive people of reddit, what are some easy things people can do to look a little better?	work out you ugly flabby fucks. *but OP I'm a poor fuck with no job wah wah I can't afford to go to a gym* Then do some fucking pushups and situps and run a mile a day, you flabby fuck *but OP i'm lazy I don't have time I'm tired I work a low paying job I'm a student blah blah* Then stay flabby you flabby fuck	Good posture. You'd be surprised how much this makes you look better. It makes your belly look flatter and your chest bigger. It will also make you appear more confident!	0
Guys of reddit, What was the the moment that you knew you were not going to hang out with a male friend anymore?	When he said 'I'm banging your ex, I hope that's cool'. No, you should have talked to me about that.	He slept with my gf behind my back and even used my money to take her out, among many other shitty things. What's weird though is that even though I hated him and we didn't speak for a couple years, I always figured that at some point things would be ok. Then we ran into each other and went for a beer, and the first thing he started talking about was how he thought all the girls in his office wanted to bang him. At first I thought he was trying to provoke me, but I soon realized he really is just that much of an oblivious prick, and that I really did hate him as a person, and not just for what he did.	0
The other day, after sex, I slapped my wifes ass and told her good game. She was not amused, Reddit what's something you did during or after sex that didn't go over as expected?	One night, my boyfriend groaned 'FOOORRRR ROOOHHAAAN!' As he came. I roll my eyes and pretend to be exasperated when he brings it up, but it was pretty funny at the time.	I said to her 'Welcome to the disease that has no cure', and she slapped me in the face. Come to think of it, that went pretty much as expected.	1
I personally believe home schooling is bad for your kids because they don't learn valuable people skills. What is your opinion on home schooling vs public schooling?	1. No social skills. 2. Any dumbassed parent can print out a home-school curriculum from the internet and teach their skewed version of knowledge to their kids. 3. They'll go into culture-shock when/if they go to college afterwards.	I think it depends on how parents home school their kids. I had friend who was home schooled, but his parents allowed him to do anything with other friends. But another girl-friend of mine was home school and was pretty much kept away from many things and she came out little crazy when she moved out.	0
What’s your best “karma’s a bitch” story?	When I was in high school I met a girl that I really liked. Ends up she liked me too and wanted to date, but I had a girlfriend. I ended up breaking up with my girlfriend in a fairly asshole way (ignored her for a while and treated her like crap). Called the other girl and she was no longer interested in dating. I ended up looking like (and being) the asshole.	I was ditched by text with zero explanation. Turns out she was cheating. Was pretty crushed. Three days later I won 250k on a scratchcard. Oh how she tried to clamber her way back in. I laughed in her face. Felt good.	0
Does anyone LOVE their job? If so, what do you do?	I'm a published author! Of course, I'm 14, so I can't really compare it to anything. ...but, I do love it!	I chop things that people will soon eat. I don't talk to customers or my manager or even my few coworkers if I so choose. I just chop things. It makes college more tolerable.	0
What movie did you go into with no expectations and ended up really enjoying?	Captain Marvel. Edit: the question is which movie *I* enjoyed. I don't care if you think it was the worst movie or just meh. Write your own comments ffs. Don't reply to this thread if you didn't like it.	The Emperor's New Groove. My wife and mom wanted to go. I hadn't heard much about it. They still tease me about how much louder I laughed than anyone else, including kids, in the theater. Obviously, it was an instant classic and still one of my favorite Disney movies of all time.	0
What was "The Scandal" at your high school?	My chemistry teacher took a leave of absence after falling ill (later learning it was due to late stage lung cancer). While he was on leave he started producing crystal meth for a local drug cartel, ended up killing everyone else in the cartel, taking over, and eventually running it himself. Shit hit the fan for him when his brother in law (local DEA) eventually found out about him and went to arrest him. Was a really crazy summer!	There were several “scandals” that happened when I was in school, but I’ll list some of the worst: * Two students got caught having sex in-between the vending machines. * A fight broke out and this kid picked up one of the English teachers, who was a really small guy (around 5’2 or so) and threw him down the stairwell as hard as possible. From what I heard, at least one ankle completely shattered and he had multiple broken ribs, among other injuries. * My senior year government teacher had sex with a student in exchange for not failing her.	0
Men of reddit, what earns your respect that someone does in front of you?	I really respected a guy at work who was temporarily made a supervisor of a second department on top of his current department he supervises. One day I needed something done on my laptop and he was very busy at that moment but he stopped what he was doing, listened very intently and then pulled out a tiny notepad from his shirt pocket and wrote down my request and my phone number. He called me shortly after lunch and took very good care of my request. I was so impressed with his organization and work ethic. At first sight he looks a little bit like a stoner going to a job interview but his leadership immediately shines through once you get to know him.	Being straightforward. People who are alpha enough to say what they want and not be a beta bitch about it. Men who are very passive aggressive, avoids conflict and gets petty do not get my respect whatsoever. Looking at you flatmate.	1
People of Reddit related to someone famous, how has it affected your family overall?	I’m related to the guy who was the DJ at the eagles Super Bowl parade. It does not affect me since we don’t see him much. I don’t really care because I’m more interested in lacrosse than football.	I have a relative that was a main character in Star Trek. It didn’t affect me much except he would be at events when I was a kid (reunions, weddings, funerals, Christmas). The only thing that happened is a teacher of mine in high school was a huge fan and I mentioned it to him. He treated me as the favorite in the class for the rest of the year.	0
What company has forever won your business?	Apple. People love to hate but they make products that work. And all their products work together which is even better.	Our family mechanic is the same way. He does dozens of "quick fixes" for free in the parking lot every single day. He'll always explain if it was just a loose this or an unplugged that. We've been going to him for years, because he earned our trust by honestly fixing those little things, we trust him with our bigger problems, too.	0
What do you pretend to enjoy, and why?	When my friend shows me a *funny picture* he found on facebook. It's usually either not funny, or I saw it already but smile and chuckle to humor him.	Leg day. At this point, I can't tell if I genuinely do enjoy it or if the whole culture of not missing leg day has subconsciously made me like it. However, I did just deadlift 300 lbs for the first time yesterday so at least I have that going for me.	1
Redditors who analyze drug tests, what's the strangest thing you've caught someone doing to try to past the test?	Way back in the day a buddy of mine had to take a pee test for his first big job as a car salesman at a dealership. Hes an avid smoker and knew he was going to fail, but his dad really wanted him to get this job so he bought him a fake dick thing that has a pouch of pee strapped to ur leg or some shit. So he goes in there with his dads pee strapped to his leg and all is going dandy. The contraption works great and he fills the cup and tries to hide his thing away and leaves the bathroom. When he walks out the woman doing the test points at his feet and says "whats that?" and there was a tube hanging out the bottom of his pants leg. He failed on the spot.	Protip: if you gotta pass the lollipop test or the test where you chew up the wad of cotton, swish really well with mouthwash or hydrogen peroxide (do not swallow the hydrogen peroxide) and you'll pass.	1
Martial Artists of Reddit, have you ever had to use your skills in self-defense in a real life situation?	My Ninja senses detect that this thread is 82.3% fantasy bullshit, 13.7% immature, poorly skilled practitioners who constantly look for trouble because they feel they they are warrior badasses, 3.6% people who just like Kung Fu movies, and .4% truth.	Our TKD classes usually involved a lot of cardio, so you bet your ass it helped when I outran those three guys trying to mug me in Durham one time. Other than that? Mmm, no.	0
Is anyone interested in a sub-Reddit for Disabled veterans. A place where all vets can learn of programs and ask questions?	I work for an IT company that teaches disabled vets how to use the internet so yes I would subscribe to that subreddit and perhaps pass it along to the guys I train.	I have absolutely no interest in a subreddit like this, but will upvote it anyway because I can see how some would appreciate it.	1
Teenagers of Reddit, what is something you frequently hear adults talking about that confuses the hell out of you?	How many older people say that this generation is horrible and ruining the world and how in their day it everything was better	19 year old. I don't understand why my parents think I'm too young for a vasectomy. I already know I'm not having kids. I don't get why they think I'll change my mind later in life. I've never seen myself having kids.	1
Teachers of reddit, whats the most interesting thing a child has brought in for show and tell?	Not a teacher, but in junior high we had to do a presentation on a family member. A girl in my class did hers on her grandfather Richard D. Winters. she literally filled an entire poster board with just the medals and badges winter received during his time in the service. &#x200B; At the time I hadn't heard of Band Brothers but my teacher was huge fan and was freaking out during the whole presentation.	I won't reveal the name, but one guy in elem school brought in a hand drawn picture of a comic character he was working on for fun. Fast forward years later and this kid ends up creating one of the most iconic comic/animated characters in history. I'm glad to say that I was one of the few who got to see his early works.	1
What aspects of a man's life are most women unaware of?	20 years passed before I was told by a woman other than my mother that I was handsome. If you think a guy is handsome TELL him. Chances are he hasn't heard it in a long time. Obviously some women aren't very often told that they're beautiful, and some men are told that they're handsome all the time but it seems to me there's still a large discrepancy there.	Literally all aspects of a man's life women have absolutely not the first clue about. Combine the facts that we spent the last two decades focusing almost solely on women, while ignoring a few generations of young boys, and that women in North America view men as some embodiment of success that experience no hardships, and lastly that we've effectively convinced women that there is no depth to and nothing to learn about men, you get NA 2016. Women will never know the first thing about a man, men, or what men may or may not go through. They think they already know everything about everything (because that's what they've been taught) and do you think they even want to learn anything about men? Absolutely not, unless it's related to how unbelievably privileged we are and how everything we accomplish takes no effort whatsoever because we have a penis.	1
Would you support airlines creating child-free flights? Why or why not?	No? It’s just a child! Sure kids can be loud and obnoxious on planes, but so can other passengers. Flying with a child is already stressful enough as it is, putting parents through the burden of having to find specific child-carrying flights seems incredibly needless. Why pay extra money for a child-free flight when you can invest that money into some better headphones and just mind your own business to get the same effect?	on some east coast trains Amtrak made "quiet cars" where silence is king. I'd support "quiet flights" where the only sounds are the engines, occasional pilot announcements (if entering turbulence, etc.) and the flight attendants' cart wheels wobbling down the aisle.	0
What's the most fucked-up thing you've ever done and you can't tell people because they would think you're totally crazy?	My crush in junior high carved her name into my arm with a rock she sharpened. And I willing let her do this. Jesus I was fucked up.	Strangled a cat and threw it in the river. I love cats now, by the way. Just answering the question.	1
American expatriates of Reddit- how does your current country of residence compare to the United States? What do you miss about the states? What do you not miss at all?	What I learned from this thread: 1. Brits are much nicer than Americans. 2. Americans are much nicer than the Brits.	Move to another country? Don't you say that OP. Don't you ever say that. Stay there. Stay as long as you can. For the love of God... cherish it. You gotta cherish it...	1
How would you respond to an interviewer that said "Teach me something"?	I would teach him that the perfect interview is not to interrogate or prompt the candidate to demonstrate their qualities through persuasive argument, but to set an example task and have them do it.	"Could you teach me something, please" And so he learned about manners. Edit: Thank you very much for the present of gold. It will be repaid tenfold to those who defend chivalry with snarky remarks.	0
Reddit, what's your best "I can't believe the cops were called" story?	My bro was freaking out at the supermarket, because all the cans looked the same, and the selections had TOO MANY PRICES AND VAULES.	Back in the day we played ultimate frisbee in the park, after dark since most of us had jobs, and it was summer so it was too hot to play during the day really. There were lights that stayed on till midnight and gave us perfect playing conditions. Anyway the cops show up one night... neighbors have complained! But we told the cops there really weren't any houses nearby, and they looked around and said we had a good point, the nearest house was 100 meters away at least, and the address of the person who complained wasn't even nearby. So the complainer had just been driving along or walking through the park, seen people playing frisbee, and called the police. The cops said the park closed at 11 but unless we were drinking or truly bothering the neighbors, we could play frisbee all we wanted.	0
[Serious] what are the biggest problems within our society?	Religion. We let it control to much of our society. The influence it brings to government decisions and laws (in some countries) is far too high. This is something that is purely a choice to believe in. (in most countries)	I'm always the good guy in every situation, in my own mind, and anyone who doesn't agree with me is the bad guy. It's a problem because everyone thinks like this on some level. Nobody wants to admit to Being evil, and they justify that by demonizing any adversary.	0
Starting tomorrow you can only eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on white bread. You get paid $500 a day. Would you do it? Why or why not?	I'D FUCKING DIE. I'M ALLERGIC TO PEANUT BUTTER YOU INCONSIDERATE ASSHOLE. WOULD YOU WANT ME TO DIE?!?! I BET YOU WOULD. AND YOU'D PROBABLY DANCE ON MY CORPSE WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT HATE MY VERY EXISTENCE, TOO. GO CHOKE ON A PB&J SANDWICH AND DIE, ASSHOLE.	Yes. Because I've been doing just that for the past week. I've been doing it for free. $500 a day? Don't mind if I do.	0
What is something you consider rude that certain people don't even consider?	When people interrupt the person I'm talking to, and cause that person to actually leave me mid-sentence and talk to them. It sucks because I will absolutely wait and hold my thought but usually they talk so long the conversation is forgotten. I just walk away now.	Showing up to a party empty handed. It doesn't matter if the host says not to bring anything. You NEVER show up to someone's party empty handed. At least bring a 6 pack.	1
You are teleported back to the same spot as now, but in the early 1800. You keep all stuff on you, all your knowledge and a phone with modern internet access and unlimited battery. How do you proceed?	Well, I'm in Japan right now so I will most likely be arrested and executed by the shogunate for being a foreigner, because, you know, sakoku policy and all. Unless.... Perry comes at the right time and tells the shogun to "open the country. stop having it be closed."	I would track down the superiors of the various British colonies across the country and, with evidence on my phone, discuss the importance of the power they hold in the next two centuries over their current "captives" and the life changing events they could alter. These "captives" would later become one of the most repressed and culture stripped people in the world, the Indigenous Australians. Thinking logically however, I don't believe anyone would listen to a teenage girl with an unfamiliar accent and a "magic interactive box" back then, so this is very far fetched.	1
What's a food you thought would be disgusting but turned out to be delicious?	That mayo stuff on french fries. It seemed like giving a lot of small blowjobs one after the other but it turned out to be pretty good.	For the longest time, I thought I did not like tomatoes. But one summer I grew some of my own and they tasted amazing. I realized that the tomatoes sold in grocery stores and more red balls of water than actual tomatoes.	0
What is the worst example of bad parenting you've seen?	These three kids in the grocery store were picking on a disabled boy in a wheelchair. They walked straight up to him and told him how creepy his legs looked. His mom tried to explain that he has a condition and the oldest boy told her to shut up. The mom never said anything to her children. I kinda wanted to break that kids legs and see how he liked having creepy legs.	Just yesterday I saw a dude disc golfing with his infant in a stroller. It was him and his two friends ahead of us and he legit had a baby in a stroller walking through a forest with bumpy ground while hard plastic discs soared overhead. I was baffled.	1
What was your “the show must go on” moment?	In 5th grade my friends and I would hit each other with plants we found on the ground, and apparently one plant was poison ivy. My face swelled up starting at my forehead and went down to my cheeks. My eyes swole almost completely shut. That Sunday I was one of the leads at an easter play we did. It was a 45 minute show with a couple of monologues. I just put on a baseball cap backwards to cover up my forehead and help pull my eyes open. Somewhere I still have the photos of my face. Looking back at it, I don't get how I still managed to have the willpower to go on, but somehow I convinced my parents to let the show go on.	I said something weird on sex. “Waldo had found a way out, IN AND OUT” Eh, she was weirded out but not that much.	1
My Car Insurer Told Me They Won't Renew My Policy "Because Of My Occupation As A Journalist". Reddit - In What Unlikely And Hilarious Ways Have You Been Discriminated Against?	Are you really a Journalist? From what I've read being a journalist is a pretty reckless career and involving amongst other things cars being written off in car chases so no wonder they didn't renew! Bibliography: Anything by Hunter S Thompson	As a non-Japanese married to a Japanese national, my name goes in the "comments" column of my husband's family register. I'm not allowed in the "wife" column.	0
What is the most annoying thing someone has done while you were watching a film in a theater?	One guy sitting behind me spilled soda all over me, and when I started to complain he told me I had to watch where I sit.	I went to watch Star Trek Into Darkness when it came out for my birthday. For those who haven't watched it, it is certainly not a romantic movie. My BF at the time wanted to snuggle and I was like "Piss off I'm watching Star Trek." and there was this couple in the corner giggling and making out like... you paid money to sit in a corner, ignore a movie and ruin it for everyone else? What is your malfunction you stupid humans.	1
What's a 100% true story from your life that's so ridiculous it seems fake?	Got a call on my office phone on my first day of work. Lady wants to set up a time to meet and gives me complex directions. I assumed it was work training. I follow the directions and end up waaay outside of town in a rural nowhere. Turns out they were trying to sell a trailer and called the wrong number.	My little brother chased me around the house when I was 5ish and he was 4 with my dads gun so out of pure panic I had to kill him with a kitchen knife, is it bad that I miss him?( it took about 1~ years for the police to close the case as an accident	1
[Serious] Parents with homosexual children, what was your initial response when your child first came out to you?	My 13 year old daughter came out to my wife and I about a month ago. My first thoughts were; She was too young to know. And she had innocent, pre-teen boyfriends before. So, maybe she was just bisexual. But that passed in just a few minutes because I remembered all the torment, self loathing, depression, anger and even self-cutting that she had gone through in the last year. So, it was easy to brush aside any of my hang ups and reassure her.	Not a parent but my little brother "who is 20" came out to the family and I told him that he knows how I feel about it but in the end he is my brother and I am not going to condemn him for it. We still have a good relationship...it's just different now.	1
If you've served in the United States military what are your opinions on first person shooters? Are they any different then before you joined? How do you feel about any video game training you have received while in the military?	The games don't include the mind numbing hours spent cleaning gear, screaming at broken radios, sitting around, picking up brass, sitting around, transgender awareness briefs, powerpoints, sitting around, and where the fuck is everyones pt belts.	I haven't served in the military but I played a few first person shooters and I think the military is very important and does a good job.	1
What's the most elaborate lie you've ever convinced a child to believe?	Back when I taught 9th grade, I convinced all of them that their math teacher had a glass eye, but was really sensitive about it. I instructed that they should never bring it up. He found out a few months later when he was complaining in the copy room that kids always were coming right up to his face to ask him questions about their work and would stare at him. I couldn't stop laughing. This, of course, started a prank war between us using our students as intermediaries.	I was hanging out with my friend and the boy she was babysitting. The boy told me he was a vegetarian. This kid was like 6 so I found it to be my duty (being from cow country) to convince him to eat meat again. He was against eating meat because it was mean to the animals. I convinced him that plants have feelings, too, and that when his mom boils vegetables she is boiling them alive. Also, when the farmer pulls the vegetable up out of the ground, he is tearing it away from his family. He became a meat eater. I did my good deed for the day.	1
Once a teacher raided his closet for clothes I could wear to a scholarship interview. I attribute my entire college education, and my career for his kindness. How has someone changed your life for the better?	A good friend once told me I was the rudest person he had ever met. Turned my manners around literally overnight.	When I was 16 I did something dumb that could have gotten me in a lot of trouble. The cop brought me into his office (at school) where I confessed to it and he could see I truely regretted it. He then gave me a disorderly conduct ticket instead of what he has could have given me which would have done a lot of damage to my future. I owe that man a lot.	1
When I was little, I wrote "Sonic The Hedgehog" on a floppy believing that was all I needed to do in order to play said game. What stupid shit did you believe as a kid, Reddit?	In the early Fifa football game series for the PS1 there was a option to play a round of 'Sudden death'. I thought that if i clicked on it I would be instantly killed.	i thought some old man in the sky was judging me, taking notes of all the bad shit i did, just waiting to dish out the punishment. just sittin there on a cloud shaking his fist at me. "Damnit Choast!, your mother said that money was for lunch! stop buying rubber band guns!!"	1
Pizza deliverers of Reddit, what is the craziest thing you've encountered while delivering pizza?	Naked people answer the door a lot more than you would expect. What sucks is that it's never the people you want to see naked...	I was called to deliver pizza one night on new year's eve right before the turn of the millennium and when I got to the building I realized it was a prank call with the order name of "I. P. Freely". So, with resignation, I sat down on an empty had the pizza for myself. When the ball finally dropped, my chair tipped over and I lost my balance. Consequently, I fell into a cryogenic chamber and was frozen 1000 years into the future.	1
Where is the most awkward or inappropriate place you suddenly become horny/turned on and maybe why?	Church. All those stories about kids being molested by priests got me really into doing it inside a church. But all I could find was a midget in a cub scout uniform. It just wasn't the same...	I used to do this creativity competition called Destination ImagiNation in middle school that involved a lot of building and crafts. My team did an Egyptian theme and, since I was the biggest one on the team, we used my body as a the mold for a life-size sarcophagus. They laid me down on the driveway, wrapped up in Saran wrap, and started applying the paste stuff. Luckily for me, my middle school body decided to go against my brain and have a boner, which is almost impossible to fix when you're on your back facing up and your hands are strapped to your sides. TL;DR: Apparently I have a fetish of being a baked potato.	0
Until my brother became one, I only tipped pizza guys $2 because I thought they were paid well per delivery. What little things do you wish people knew about your job?	I wish people understood that though I am not paid: I am fully employed! Don't know how I managed to pick such unpaid professions as: single mother, musician, community worker, writer...how did I do this to myself? I wish that people understood that someone's work can be valuable though they are not paid... Employed: 2. To put to use or service. 3. 3. To devote (time, for example) to an activity or purpose: employed several months in learning Swahili.	Work for a gas station convenience store for the summer, graveyard shift. People, please stop coming in on Friday and buying a $0.30 pack of gum and giving me a $100 bill for it. It's not a fucking bank. I only have $50 in change in my register so I won't get robbed. Also, even if you waited long enough for me to accumulate $100 from other customers, I still wouldn't break your $100 bill because then my register would be empty and I would be unable to operate For the last time: Gas station != a bank Find somewhere else to break your $100 bills on payday	0
What's an issue that burdens your soul right now? What emotional problem would you like to get off your chest?	I feel totally alone and I think no one would care if I wasn't there Edit: Thank you for all the kind and encouraging replies. I love you guys	The teachers at my school think I'm not being bullied and that I'm faking self harm and depression and it burdens me greatly to know that they're just plating off major things like bullying and depression as a joke. This needs to end but my school's extremely sexist and boys aren't allowed to join the council's permanently so every year we usually have an all girls student council who decided that boys shouldn't be allowed to wear deodorant and aftershave and stuff like that. I can't get my voice heard by the school. It makes me sad to think other people are going through this too.	1
Babysitters of Reddit, what is the creepiest/weirdest experience you've had while watching kids?	3 y/o: "There's strangers .... there's strangers in the backyard..." "THERE'S STRANGERS IN THE BACKYARD" Kid runs. Back door starts rattling. Called my dad who lived across the street - in tow with my brother they scavenger the back yard... to find two raccoon's fighting.	Once I was watching a bunch of kids playing on the playground. Somehow their parents saw me and I got arrested. And butt raped.	1
Trump voters, what do you think of him backing down on a lot of promises?	I have my Trump-voting in-laws here for Thanksgiving and so far I've resisted the urge to engage in political discussions, but it gets me mad that he ran his campaign on hate, intolerance and childish name-calling, whipping up the masses, and now he says oh, we need to come together again and be nice. Well sorry, you've created this vast divide in the country and you don't just get to say a few nice words and hope it will be better. End of rant, for now.	A frequent refrain I've heard is: the press took him literally but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally. I don't think anyone is shocked about his shifting positions. They certainly shouldn't be. Edit: Obligatory 'thanks for the gold, kind stranger!'	0
mistresses of reddit - Why do you do it?	Well, I met the mistress once, and we had a nice chat about how she felt superior to me whenever he would rather have her than me, but said she didn't want to hurt me anymore (I had been suspecting and there were fights) so that's why she came clean. They are now going strong and I am sitting here kicking flowers. Edit: Wow, I did not expect all of this sympathy. Thanks, all of you, but it's a learning experience, you know? And yes, I will be kicking the flowers on their graves. Bitterness till the end!	this whole thread = a bunch of sluts telling storys about how big of a slut they are, while acting like theyre the victim. this is by far the most annoying thread ive ever seen on reddit. edit : you can downvote me all you want, doesnt change facts. this thread is a disgusting meeting of daddy issues, selfishness, and general blame shifting. the lack of responsibility in these storys are fucking disgraceful	1
What topic do you love to discuss?	Abortion, hands down. I am personally pro-choice, and I love proving people wrong when it comes to the topic. I may not change their views, but I don't care.	Probably space. The part where you talk about it to much and you start to question your own existence is weirdly satisfying.	0
Why do corporations refuse to understand that stopping piracy is impossible, and continue forcing things like DRM and the Protect-IP act when literally the only thing it does is harm *everyone* but the pirates?	DRM isn't made for Scene people. DRM is there so that John Smith and his teen kids Jack and Jane can't get around it. You know, the ordinary folks.	Stopping piracy isn't impossible. In fact given the trend toward greater and greater centralization in the how the internet works it's almost certainly inevitable. Now downvote away because you like pirating stuff.	1
After four years of dating and two children, my fiance has told me that he'd "rather be single." What do I do now?	I personally just went through the same thing...do you have family close by? If not get home to them your parents/ friends can help until you are back on your feet..there is also state funded daycare until you're working again...its hard I know but you have to stay strong for the babies.	Start talking child support and see how much longer he wants to remain single. Child support is there specifically for situations like your own; you could have had a career but you stayed at home to raise the children. There is a lot of money you could have been making or skills you could have improved that were spent catering to him. Go get yours.	1
What are some ridiculous parenting rules you've seen people use on their kids?	letting 7 year-olds play Fortnite. Edit: The amount of negative points I get are the amount of people who are 7, play forntite and lie about their age to get on reddit.	I had friends that were twins - fraternal female twins. Their mom had a different set of rules for them (their dad wasn't in the picture). One was probably emotionally abused while the other was the golden child. The abused one wasn't allowed to hang out with friends while the other had free reign. The golden child would convince their mom to allow the abused one to tag along with her. It was quite sad actually.	0
Reddit, Whats your favorite "No fucking way?!" story?	Aw, come on, man...don't call him "that missing retarded kid" :( Try "the missing kid with developmental disabilities" perhaps? I mean, I wouldn't call myself "that eye-glassed girl" or "the migraine chick" or anything...	My sister was driving down the street at 45 mph with her windows open and a deer ran into the street. Instead of hitting this deer, the deer jumped into her car through the window landed with its head in the foot part of the passenger side seat, and its butt on the head rest. The deer was freaked the fuck out, and with its butt in the air, proceeded to shit all over the car. She obviously pulled over; several people stopped to help and asked her where the deer was. She just stood there screaming, "IT'S IN THE CAR! IT'S IN THE CAR!" A helpful man opened the door, pulled the deer out, and the deer bounded off like nothing happened. For imagery, she was driving a late 90's Ford Escort at the time. No one believes this story, but it is 100% true.	0
People who "get" modern art and art galleries what are the rest of us doing wrong?	> what are the rest of us doing wrong? Nothing. > People who "get" modern art and art galleries I do "get" it, but not all of it. And, I surely don't like all of it either. You see a piece of art, modern or otherwise: 1. do **YOU** like it? Yes? Good. No? Just as well. 2. Do not let anyone, but the artist themselves, tell you anything about the art that nobody else but the artist themselves will (maybe) know. Specifically: * What the Art means (unless there's a written statement of the Artist stating so, and even then...) * What was the intent of the Artist (unless there's a written statement of the Artist stating so, and even then...) * Whether a piece of Art is good or not Just enjoy it. Or not.	Accept that a lot of it is down to elitism and feeling superior due to speaking the language of art which only a select few seem to converse in despite it all being a case of the Emperor's new clothes and it's only a matter of time before the house of cards eventually tumbles. Having said that there is some nice stuff still being created. All rather inevitable really since the invention of photography and the role of art being released from the shackles of representation.	1
What is the stupidest thing you've ever seen a tourist do?	Tourists let their kid near the water at Disney world, there was a sign that said no swimming, the kid was killed by an alligator.	Saw a young kid in Australia shove his hands into a Kangaroo's pouch, he got pretty fucked up by those huge feet...	0
What do you hate the most when going out to eat at a restaurant?	When I ask for water and they don't ask me if I want lemon with it and bring it to me anyway. I don't want the damn lemon, why didn't you ask me? Now I have to awkwardly take it off of my glass and put it on a napkin or something. Please just ask if I want the damn lemon and don't automatically bring it to me.	When a restaurant is so concerned with turnover that they rush you through a meal. There is a local place that brings your check 5 mins after you've gotten your food, and another one that if you haven't paid your check within 10 mins of finishing your food they will come ask you to please free up the table for other customers.	0
If your employer gave you the option to work 10 hr days Mon-Thurs instead of 8 hr days Mon-Fri would you do it? Why not why not?	I have an unusual schedule. I work 4 days, 4 days off, work 3 days, 3 days off. Not exactly the schedule you're talking about but it has its pros and cons. You will always have a three day weekend, which means you don't have to spend the entire time doing errands and playing catch up. Three days is usually enough to go camping or work on your car, or your hobby. On the downside, you work a little bit extra each day. However, think about it this way; Monday-Thursday you're already spending most of your day at work. Wouldn't it be nice to just spend a couple more hours working each day and have that 3 day weekend?	Already did, and it was awesome while it lasted (our company was bought out by a terrible company owned by libertarians). Three day weekend every weekend is great for stress reduction. I'd gladly do what my wife's friend does as a nurse and just work 3 12-hour shifts per week and make like $100,000. My last job after we were bought out it was 6 days a week for $36,000 a year. For a 4-year-degree job journalism pays like shit.	1
[Serious] Fathers of Reddit when did you realize your daughter was promiscious and how did you deal with it?	Hi there OP. Thread was removed, due to users not being able to follow directions. The title was >Fathers of reddit.... Not anyone else that wanted to answer.	Had " the talk". Gave her a box of condoms. Asked her to tell her mom everything. Which she did. My wife started telling me , but after a while I stuck my fingers in my ears and went " na na na ". Some stuff you just don't want to know.	0
Nudists, how awkward was puberty?	I wonder how many people actually are nudists? Seriously, I hope this thread gets some replies because there are bound to be some entertaining answers. My question to nudists is simply... *why*?	I am SUPER excited to see these replies. Dont let me down guys and gals! Even if it means lying..	1
What feature would you include in the next smartphone?	A phone with thin, but effective armor so I don't have to mess with a bulky case and having to take my phone out of it's otter box to attach it to standard accessories. I know batteries are a big problem, but having a phone that doesn't turn into dust after a 6 inch drop would be great.	A small robotic hand. When the phone's microphone hears the word "selfie", the robot hand will extend and slap the dickins out of whoever said it.	1
911 Operators : What was your best &amp; worst call?	Worst call for me, by far, was the gentleman who was in his driveway in his big SUV waiting to pull out onto the road. A group of little girls were walking by and he waited. When he thought they were through, he backed up and ended up running over one of them. Neighbors immediately began CPR. Why they had *him* call 911 himself, I don't know, but I'm thankful he used a landline because I don't think I would have been able to get the address out of him. He was beside himself, hollering and screaming that "she's dead, oh my god, she's dead" over and over. The little girl didn't make it. Later that evening, I got a 911 call from his wife -- he attempted suicide. Best? I don't know. I can't say any of them are my best ones.	One lady called the cops cause a black family was having a barbecue in a public park. Another lady called because a small black girl was selling water outside her house.	1
Japanese People of reddit, what western foods seem disgusting and/or weird to you?	I grew up with a lot of western food. I find gravy and grits kind of disgusting. It's a little too thick and rich for my liking. I also don't like the cheep-ass Walmart cakes. It's all sugar and bland. Normal cakes are good but I personally like Japanese cakes better. I also think it's weird for kids to eat those tiny lunchables. That is simply not lunch!	**Cheese** is the weirdest western food to me. Here's why * At one point of human history, some people decided to steal milk from other animal. Like "hey bro, let's suck that cow tits!" * After they found out milk from other animal is edible, they decided to leave until the bacteria solidifies the milk. "hey bro, let's not drink the milk for now, just wait until it starts getting smelly and hard" * Cheese is often served melted, it resembles cum. "hey bro, this stuff looks like a pile of warm jizz, let's eat it" * Some cheese is often consumed cold and hard, it smells like rubber band jelly. Another weird food is peanut butter, why do you call it peanut butter if there's no butter in it?	1
What one realization changed your life?	All the muscle, money, and good looks amount to nothing, what girls really want is to be dicked down on a regular basis	"I need to take control of my life, because no-one is going to force me to make something out of it."	0
Reddit, should guys who are in relationships be expected to split the cost of Birth Control with their partner?	I'm married so our financial splitting is a little different but I love our solution. At the end of each month we take all costs that we deem shared (food, mortgage, etc.) and split them based on our percent of total income. So if I make 60k per year and she makes 40k, I would pay 60% of the bills, and she pays 40%. The monthly exercise is great for helping us track spending, and allows us our "own" money to spend on personal things. So we don't have arguments about hand bags or video games being too expensive. We do track costs for dates and birth control as shared.	is she willing to split the cost of a vasectomy? probably not. your question is yet another example of the typical American female's one-way-road.	1
[Serious] People who witnessed, or were victims of attempted murder, what happened?	Dude stabbed a guy at the ATM and tried to grab his money. Dude that got stabbed punched him in the face and knocked him flat, then a bunch of people grabbed him and he got arrested. I assume the stabbed guy is fine, he didn't seem too bothered about having had a knife in him a few minutes previously.	I used to hang with surenos when i was young and stupid, so this is an interesting story, i never thought I'd read anything about the sur or the norte on Reddit so this is a first, but anyway im glad everyone was ok, it's a shame that these motherfucker's can't even manage to be civilized on a holiday that's all about family (real family) but anyway where you from?	1
[NSFW] What's one thing you wish you'd never seen?	I started off in Brooklyn. My father gave me a small loan of a million dollars. I came into Manhattan and I had to pay him back, and I had to pay him back with interest. But I came into Manhattan, I started buying up properties, and I did great.	Witnessed a man shoot himself. Had a man come into a gun store I was at, purchase a fire arm, walk out into the parking lot, load the gun, and shoot himself. This was a week before X-mas. He didn't die right away either, he knocked out the right side of his head and eye, but was still alive. He died 3 days later. Came to find out that he had come from his dr where he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. He hadn't even gone home to tell his family yet. I'll never forget how calm he was when he walked in. He had made up his mind I guess.	0
999/911 operators, what is the scariest call you have received?	What a coincidence I have just watched 'The Call' earlier and there is a thread about 911 calls!! also thank you for the answers	The hardest one I had was one night I'm working alone, my partner just went home an hr early. I get a call from a man who told me his 16yo daughter came home beat up, dirty and bloody. She didn't remember what had happened but had "I hit that" carved into her stomach from a knife. I could hear an older brother screaming in the background "who did that to you". It still gives me chills. Edit:quotation marks	0
Ladies, what's your biggest deal breaker?	A guy who can't take care of himself. If he can't properly take care of himself, he sure can't take care of me. EDIT: SOMEONE WHO IS NOT RESPONSIBLE. No one seems to understand what I mean.	Guys who are still obsessed with their ex girlfriends of four years ago, and go completely insane when you confront them on it.	0
If you were paid 10000 dollars in order to ruin a couple's date and make them hate one another, how would you do it?	I'd offer an ex of one of theirs half the money. They would show up on the date and act like they were back together. The best part about paying am ex instead of an actor is that the ex will have photos of the two together as proof.	Let's say they're at a restaurant having dinner. I'd go up to the guy and be like Me: Oh hey dude weird to see you here. Is she that jenny girl you were telling me about? She looks different than the photos. Him: Who the fuck are you? Me: Oh shit dude does she not know? Sorry. Then just walk out Or keep sending the dude a bunch of hookers whenever they're out. And have them constantly texting him.	0
What good deed did you regret doing and why?	I saw a homeless lady looking distressed in a BK parking lot. I offered her a ride. After about a mile I had to get her out of my car because she smelled like an outhouse and I just can't take that smell. Two bottles of fabreeze did NOTHING. I ended up using some enzyme solution from the pet store and I could still kind of smell it. Never again.	I financially carried my ex-boyfriend for two years, to give him a chance to live in the place he really wanted to live. I financially supported his hobbies because they were fairly reasonable and made him happy. He was lying to me the entire time about his finances to the effect that I was draining myself dry to essentially cover his child support to a kid he was uncertain was his, while he still got all his fun toys and I couldn't afford anything of my own beyond bare necessities. I am now a bitter cynic who hangs on to her money like Scrooge McDuck.	0
What are you waiting for or looking forward to the most right now?	The Republican Party getting dissolved after Trump leaves office via getting impeached or simply losing his next presidential run. After that it's the Democratic Party I'm going after next. Both sides have long overstayed their welcome and it's time for a revolution in how we run our governments/how they run us.	Being able to walk. I haven't done so since June first. If I'm lucky I can start physical therapy August 17th.	0
You are given the best developers in the world, 500 million dollars and 5 years, what game do you make?	A game where physics changed one day and you have to survive in a colony in outer space. But there are old laws removed and new ones added randomly in each game so each run is different.	Ultimate Meme Combat 1 with dlcs and mods. it would basically be super smash bros but you can play as any meme	1
What is the biggest issue you and your SO don't agree with each other over?	Oh fuck what DO we agree on. He’s conservative and I’m an SJW, so like, there’s a lot to inbox lol. I think the biggest one is maybe Islam? He believes it’s a backwards religion with no excuse for the way it treats people, I believe it is backwards in theocratically ruled countries because of the theocracy, and has room to reform, just like Christianity did.	Planning stuff. She's tried planning *everything* for the next several months because she can't stand it otherwise, and she's very organized and feels the need to control every situation. I, on the otherhand, just take things day by day, plan where absolutely needed, and enjoy the unpredictability life throws.	0
What is an example of a film marketed completely wrong?	Gremlins was marketed as a kids movie with cute things running around making mischief. Lots of childhood trauma ensued when the cute little furry things turned into homicidaly mischievous monsters.	Birdman. I watched it because the trailer made it look like a comedy. What utter shit. Probably one of the worst films I've ever seen.	1
Men, what are some things girls think you don't notice, but you do?	Every time you touch us. Like a touch on the arm or a playful punch. Guys rarely touch each other and when we do, it is not gentle. It's rare enough that when a girl touches you in a way that is not maternal, it makes an impression.	We notice when some women take their makeup off and look like a completely different person. We find it greatly disturbing and wish women would stop with all the makeup.	1
[UPDATE] I'm running away (it's okay, I'm 31). My husband just figured out he's gay, I found out my cancer is back, and I don't have any friends or family to keep me here. Where should I go? What should I do?	i did a little creeping on this girls history, no creeper. in one post dated ten months ago, she says she's 28. some other discrepancies. just saying.	I think this is what total freedom looks like. I don't really know you, but you have a hell of a way with dealing with the shit that you've been dealt with. I hope you see and experience everything you want to. It's a shame you've decided to avoid further treatment. We need more people like you around. We'll all see you on the other side if there is one.	0
What is your biggest dream, and how can we make you succeed?	To be the most gilded comment in reddit history EDIT: you guys aren't very good at the whole 'making dreams come true' thing	I want to be a voice actor. I am a chemical engineering student, but that's not my true desire. I have a deep voice (movie announcer type) and don't suck at accents, but I can't imagine how terrible I'd feel if I focus on pursuing VO work over ChemE work, both monetarily for my family (now and down the line) and for potentially making an impact in something important. If you guys send me things, I'll say them for you and post them to the internet. And if anyone has a project they want voiced, I'll gladly help. At least then, even if it's not a job, I can be doing what I love :)	0
Would you be alive today if modern medicine did not exists? If not, what killed you?	I'm trans. I needed to take HRT (hormone replacement therapy) to get my body to switch from the wrong one to the right one. I'm immeasurably happy these days and it saved my life. I probably would have killed myself by 30 if I had to live in my old body back when this kind of thing wasn't possible.	I'm a c-section baby. I'm guessing my mom would have sacrificed herself, but there's a chance I still would have died. The first recorded c-section where both mother and child survived was actually way back in the 1580s, but the odds were terrible until much more recently.	0
Help: Just received the biggest customer service fuck you from Time Warner Cable! Any options?	I had an issue with Time Warner Cable and reminded the "supervisor" that there were options and he told me to explore them. I now have Uverse and ATT cable and am pretty happy. Thanks for the suggestion TWC!	this is unacceptable,okay preapre for two things 1] see if you can locate a bill which must have the details of the plan you had earlier 2] call that guy again, This time Start a recorder on phone and go thorugh whole convo again, save the recording. 3] tell him you have got evidences of having service & being denied of service & you will not find a lawyer, if this dosent shake him to start service again 4] go to a consumer court or something and file a complaint with evidences.	1
What is the dumbest conspiracy theory somebody has tried to convince you about?	My mom is convinced that the government forces you to buy the new twisty type of lightbulbs so that your Caller ID doesn't work. She also told me in high school that we couldn't get the internet because the phone lines (dial-up) connect you to the devil.	God. I'm not being flip and not trying to be offensive. The whole idea of God just seems extraordinarily ridiculous to me.	1
What's a word that has completely lost its original meaning due to society?	Rights! Companies do not have rights! Governments do not have rights! Only people have rights and those rights are granted by your creator not the government and not the constitution.	Nice. Used to mean "ignorant, stupid." But it was used sarcastically for so long that it ended up becoming its opposite.	0
What are some deep, thought provoking questions to ask someone to know them better?	"Who are you?" People seem to say that they're religious, that they're a particular race, maybe say that they're of a particular sexual orientation, or their job. These are all attributes of an individual but aren't who they are. The only real answer is "I am me" because it sums up the understanding that they are a unique individual without the labels listed above. It's a little philosophical but it's honestly an interesting little question that says a lot about a person.	One question I like to ask people is: "If you had all the resources, time and land available to build whatever you want (a house, a park, a monument...), what would you build?" I'm no architect nor phsycologist, and I know it kind of sounds like an interview question, but I believe it can trigger a very interesting discussion with that person. And you can keep asking about the reasons and details afterwards. That question is something I came up while I was dating my last partner. When I asked her that question, she started talking about how she would imagined her dream house, full of large windows and mosaics, with a colorful garden, and so. From there, it turned into a surprisingly long and pleasant conversation.	0
What movie actually pissed you off?	40 Days and 40 Nights. The guy gets raped by his ex-girlfriend and then has to apologize to his new girlfriend.	Every fucking war movies that America has involved. Like Iraq, Vietnam, Afghan, etc. Americans always portray themselves as the good guys who are their to help the helpless, others are just scums who want to kill. Basically, like a ginger bearded funny man once said '' Not only America will go into your country and kill your people, but they will come back and make a movie about how kililng your people made their soldiers feel bad''.	1
Redditors who went on anti-depressants, did things actually get better?	For me, it was when the doc took me off antidepressants and put me on anti-anxiety meds instead. Inside of a few weeks I felt like a more stable, normal person.	No. Antidepressants do several things but curing depression is not one of them. You have to identify bad patterns. Recognize that you are not your thoughts. Address your inconvenient thought patterns.	1
What is something that you used to be a cheap ass on, until you tried the high-quality version, and now you can't go back?	Alcohol. These days, I get really triggered by people who suggest that cheap beer and booze is just as good as expensive stuff. Especially because they tend to imply that we're being idiots for spending the extra money. No, Chad, we're not just drinking Belgian beer and Scottish Whisky because we hate money. I once read a post of someone who complained about "whisky snobs" who would scoff at him when he brought a bottle of Jack to their get together. But I totally understand the "snobbish" point of view. There's nothing wrong with having an uncomplicated drink with friends, but if you bring Jack to a whisky evening, you're basically not taking part in the event. Edit: Wow, three downvotes already from people with shitty taste. Why are people with unrefined palettes always so sensitive?	Cheese. My dirty little secret: I keep a budget for housing, utilities, etc. and one of the items I budget for are delicious cheeses.	0
If you could insert a referee into any part of your life, striped shirt and all, where/when would you?	At my work so if the customer is being a jackass the ref could call it out. PENALTY! You are asking for a manager even though the employee told you the exact thing the manager is going to tell you.	In all interactions with members of the opposite sex in all contexts. I want everyone to know I'm playing by the rules and conducting myself as if I was on trial for murder, and having the ref there protects me from them.	1
Should prisoners sentenced to life in prison be given the option of the death penalty?	Prisoners shouldn't ever be given life sentences for any crime. Every country needs to adopt hard maximum prison term laws of at *most* 20 years.	Out of curiousity, if this was approved, could it create a perverse incentive for publically owned prisons to make the life of prisoners as terrible as they can legally make possible? Privately owned prisons get a stipend per prisoner, while public ones have a budget to work within. If they can get a prisoner to choose death, then the budget is less tight. So...get prisoner to "choose" death through shit like terrible food, allowing frequent violent, cells even worse shape, etc. Personally, I'd say yes on face value but with risk of the above, no.	0
What's the craziest coincidence you've ever experienced?	I sat next to the same kid in homeroom all 4 years of high school. Fast forward ~10 years, have not spoken to the guy. Someone new is starting at my company and will be moving into the cube next to mine. It's him. So I'm still sitting next to him.	Went to the Jersey Coast this past August(I think?). I'm not one for all the YOLO and white trash stuff, so I joked with my mom "If a hurricane hit here, would anything of value be lost?" Fast forward a few months...yeah.	1
Is it wrong or selfish to ask my boyfriend to cut down/ stop smoking weed?	Asking him to be sensitive to your needs isn't really selfish, don't ask him to straight up stop, but asking him to go outside to smoke isn't a horrible thing. Simply say "Hey, [bf] I'm really sensitive to the smell of weed and if you could go outside to smoke it when I'm around then that would be a big relief for me. I'm not against you smoking weed, the smell just bothers me, thanks!"	Why does he need to cut down or stop smoking all together just because you don't like the smell? I think a more reasonable solution would be asking him to smoke it away from you. Plus, I'm guessing you went into the relationship knowing he smokes weed.	1
What is something crazy that you believed as a child?	that If ur on the phone u can't see anything.....I thought those big phones went over ur eyes not able to see	I thought the lunchlady was God. I went to a religious pre-school/daycare type thing (even though my family isn't religious), and every day at lunch we'd thank God for our food. Then a lunchlady would bring me food. Therefore lunchlady=God	0
What is the most embarrassing thing you are willing to admit about yourself without using a throwaway account?	Once when I was drunk, I took a bath and fell asleep in the process. I woke up in the morning to my dick being erect and my whole family staring at it cruising in the water. I got up, grabbed a towel and went to my room without a word.	I am a 23 year old male. The first 15 years of my life, we(my family) lived out of a car. I didn't get my own room until I was 17. I am a virgin, have never been kissed, have never been on a date, have never been invited to a party, shin-dig, or sleep over. I have 0 friends or associates except for my mom and nephew. I practice for conversations I'll never have. I don't identify well with other members of my race.	1
Medical professionals of Reddit, what is the a) largest b) weirdest thing you have ever pulled out of a bodily orifice? What was the accompanying story?	Assisted in removing a head and shoulders shampoo bottle from some old guy’s sigmoid colon. Yes, one of the rectangular bottles. I’ll never forget seeing the surgeon forearm deep in this guy. Patient said he “had an itch.”	One time I pulled out an entire set of fine China from a patient’s rectum. They got mad that I didn’t pay for it before taking it.	1
Dentists, what was your WTF moment after you looked into someone's mouth?	Dentist for 34 years, father of this users account here, about 20 years ago this lady came in to the office asking to clean her teeth. When I looked into her mouth on the inside of her lower front teeth she had so much tartar that there was no gums around the teeth. Only the tartar kept her teeth in her mouth. When you do dentistry, you see some shit...	One day a regular patient of ours came in, all seemed normal, pleasantries were exchanges but later on in the day I was going to a life altering amount of poor hygene. As soon as they sat in the chair and uttered an ahh at my request, I saw that since their last visit most of their teeth had been nearly rotten all the way through, not even kidding, I swear one of the back molars was hollow. Long story short they now need dentures.	1
People that roll slightly forward at stop lights, what are you trying to accomplish?	When I see that the person behind me needs to make a right turn and just needs that extra little bit of wiggle room to pass.	I'm preparing to go. What else would I be doing? I'm not rolling into other cars, I maintain a safe distance, and I don't roll into the pedestrian crosswalk, though.	1
What have you never told your best friend because you're afraid it may end the friendship?	That I think her Republican politics are pretty abhorrent and I can't believe someone that intelligent has such backward views on basic things that could make her and others' lives better.	I never told my friend that I know that her and her boyfriend used to steal food from my house. Her boyfriend at the time basically stole from everyone and was always getting fired from work for stealing from the till. The bit that upsets me is that she knew full well that if she needed food, I'd have given it to her. She didn't need to steal the stuff. She ditched that boyfriend which is why we're still friends. (And she doesn't steal from me anymore.)	0
What seemingly harmless common phrase/advice directed at you annoys the living hell out of you?	"Life isn't fair." After intentionally doing something unfair to you. That goes up there with "It's a free country." and "Prove it."	"Hi, how's it going?" or some phrases like that. Well, I'm fine. But I know you don't give a shit and that you're just trying to be nice. So, shut the fuck up.	1
In public, I make sure to kiss my wife when she knows there is a really hot chick around. Reddit, what tricks do you have to make you wife/husband feel good?	I am a carpenter, and on days when the weather is bad and I'm outside working my wife texts me to say she appreciates that I'm working hard. It makes my day every time.	Well, I do a lot for my husband. But that is more because I enjoy doing them than to "make him feel good". I'm happy and secure in my relationship, so I don't need him to do anything to make me feel good either.	1
How do you feel about death?	I don't really spend too much time thinking about it. Here's what we know: We're born. We live. We die. We have zero credible evidence that suggests there's some kind of afterlife or a soul or anything like that. I'm not looking forward to death, but I don't spend any time worrying about it.	I accept that I will die. I don't fear it really, I fear suffering more. But the fact that I can't decide when or how frightens me.	0
What subtle forms of racism must be properly explained before they can be understood by those who don't experience them?	Probably a bit of a weird example, but explaining to my Caucasian friends that the reason why the Korean kids rejected me (I was born in South Korea) and wanted nothing to do with me was because I wasn't considered to be a "real" Korean, since I'm adopted by (Caucasian) Australian parents. To be honest, most of the racist comments in high school actually came from other Asians. Edit: Something else that happened in my childhood was that people would say, "Go back to your country/where you came from!", and I remember being really confused about it because I'd be like, "But I'm Australian? How can I go back to Australia when I live here?" I think since I was never raised as a "Korean" but rather as an Australian, I never thought of myself as being Korean.	Not exactly subtle, but people assuming I'm a nazi because I'm a Caucasian who voted for and supports our President. Luckily I don't give a shit what people think.	1
What is the best 'adult joke' a kids' movie has gotten away with?	The scene in the 2000 version of The Grinch where Cindy learns where babies come from. One of the men in that scene sees the baby and yells to her "Hey Honey, our baby's here!" and then mutters "He looks just like your boss...."	Not a joke as such, and not from a movie (double fail, I know. But it came into my head so I'm sharing) in the pacman cartoon series they travel back in time at one point and he see his younger self. One of the characters says "that's the cutest packy I've ever seen"	1
People who have stayed awake for a long time, what happened?	I either get deliriously giggly and cry-laugh myself into oblivion, or I get to the so-tired-I'm-not-tired state where I am perfectly calm and awake, but brain function can only do one task at a time and my movements are less energetic, but in taking out my overly energetic movements, I subsequently run more efficient... though not any faster or slower in completing tasks.	If nightmare is a good source i think that you start going crazy and your brain does little dreams while you are awake.	1
What the weirdest thing you did while you were high?	Programmed several features to a game I had trouble doing earlier. I don't even remember my thought process at the time, but it was awesome to wake up to.	Some girls in high school invited me to go smoke and swim in a creek with them. Of course I went to got high as fuck. Spent the next 30 minutes sitting in the creek, I was so still that a fish came up and bit my ass. I didn’t realize what I was doing until one of the girls ask me why the fuck I was all alone sitting in the middle of a creek not moving.	0
As a robber, what is something that you could steal that would cause a slight inconvenience to the residents of a home?	Anything that is a very minor form of sabotage , to the point of childish pesky behavior , works very well in inconveniencing people	You know those little trays in microwaves that you put your food on that spin? Just take that. You can't just buy those in the store. You'd have to special order that sucker, all while trying to figure out where the hell it went. Pure evil.	0
Today my close friend argued that the anonymity of the internet is influencing the acceptability of rudeness of individuals in society outside of the internet. What are your thoughts?	The biggest fact about the Internet is that it is an impersonal method of communication, thus we do not have to face the consequences of our actions, but most importantly, the empathy, for many it seems, is completely removed from the situation. I highly doubt many people that are rude online are actually that way in real life, and doubt many of them would be.	I disagree. We are a very small minority, those of us who actually comment and submit content. 99% of the people out in the world use the Internet for looking up information, YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, etc. They are never engaging in anonymous conversation with strangers. The people on message boards and reddit are not the common.	1
What's that shitty thing your roommate does?	He's a hypocritical social justice warrior who doesn't respect how my sport takes precedence over most everything and who tries to get hookups over the week, when I have practice the next day at 5:00 in the morning.	I made pork steaks, put them in a bowl then covered them with plastic wrap. She bit into one half way -just so the meat dangled off- then stuck it back into the bowl with the rest of the steaks... Fucking nasty.	0
Which conspiracy theory is so believable that it might be true?	The American education system is purposely infantilizing students well into young adulthood, to keep them helpless and dependent on government, so that they will continue to reliably vote Democrat.	That your phones microphone is constantly "hot" and its listening for key words to target advertising. Most glaring instance where this happened to me was when I walked into a colleagues office. He had just gotten a standing desk, but one that goes on top of his existing desk rather than a standalone (pun?) Model. That's important to note. I said "Nice standing desk, when did you get that?". "Thanks, just today." He replied. That was literally all that was said about the desk. We talked about work related stuff and as I walked out and checked my phone, there was an ad on Facebook for that EXACT model of standing desk. I have never owned one, wanted one, or googled one before. Yet there it was on my feed. Tin foil hat be damned, they listen in.	0
Successful people who got crappy grades in high school or college - what are you doing now and how did (or didn't) your grades affect your success/career?	I got really bad grades in both. When I was in my early thirties, I had a big chip on my shoulder about it and started taking college classes at-large, one at a time. The motivation I had to do well in them was incredible. After a while of that, I was able to take my new transcripts and use them to get into grad school. No one cared that I had gotten poor grades ten years earlier.	I have a high I.Q. and school was boring for me. I had crappy grades and still got into college, did computer science related work but it blew bubbles. Got out of that and into working in the diesel industry also began producing music and very successful at both. I have never been asked about my grades in school. Just grind, you don't need a piece of paper to be successful, you just need the work ethic.	1
If companies were prostitutes, what would they be like?	Companies wouldn't be prostitutes, as prostitutes do the work themselves. Companies would be pimps and madams running whorehouses. Some of them would treat their prostitutes decently, while others would have crack whores.	facebook doesn't charge you for the sex but takes your ID card out of your wallet quietly after the act is done	0
Has sending an unsolicited dick pic ever yielded positive results, and if so, what?	It inhibited my cannibalistic compulsion for a while, it was a welcome reprieve from trying to satiate an appetite in unorthodox ways. However, I forwarded the picture to someone who's culinary predilection encompasses phallic delicacies and they were very effusive at the prospect. I then divulged the praise to the penis owner who seems perturbed; he alternated between incredulous and asserting I must be behaving facetiously.	Yes; I was one digit off. It actually went to another dude. He said "impressive." We got to talking for a few and it turns out he lived close by. We have been close friends for 4 years now.	0
What's the worst joke to tell a girl on the first date?	Wow, time to nope the fuck out of this thread. Thanks again, reddit, for reassuring me that people in this world still think rape is funny...	A girl i was picking up in a bar once said 'I don't think i've ever had sex with a guy whose been playing guitar at the same time' I replied 'Well... I don't know how many songs i can play in 17 seconds' My friend, chatting up her mate, burst out laughing... they exchanged awkward glances. WORTH IT.	0
What is the dumbest thing that you regularly do, despite knowing it’s stupid/wrong?	I mindlessly browse the web at night, go to bed late, and wonder the next day why my mornings suck so much. &#x200B; I *should* go to be in time and wake up rested ... but, you know, the internet doesn't read itself.	It does depends what mood I'm in but sometimes, regardless of where I am, E.G a on a bus, a shopping mall or simply in church confessing to the pastor. If there isn't a bathroom nearby I'll crap my pants ruthlessly whilst trying to maintain normality to the people around me. As you can imagine, sometimes it's difficult especially whilst in a crowded public place or in deep conversation, especially with a pastor. I know it's wrong, but I can't seem to stop.	1
What is that one moment from your childhood that your family never fails to remind you of?	My sister got a bike for her birthday but the tires desperately needed to be pumped up. My dad convinced me that I could do it with my breath, but when I tried blowing into the tire nothing happened. He then convinced me that I could blow harder if I flapped my arms like a chicken. This went on for about 15 minutes.	When I was three, I stood on the kitchen table. Apparently, no three year old in the history of the universe ever stood on the kitchen table. I was given some awful nickname from my sister about it and she finally stopped calling me that when I was 20 and I punched her in the face.	1
I fucking love riddles. What are your best hardest riddles?	You live in a country with a corrupt mail system. They open every package if they can. You put a lock on the box. You can't mail a key. How does the receiving person open the box?	A room is built around you. You're trapped in this room with no doors, no windows. There is nothing in this room other than a mirror and a table. How do you get out?	1
One of my professors once said that mechanical engineering was basically the application of two laws: F=ma, and "You can't push a rope." What's a fun over-simplification of your field of study?	You're dumb and you don't understand anything, but you will as soon as we give you this diploma. High school senior two weeks from graduating.	English degree: I read books. Then I went and got my Library Science degree so now I'm qualified to put my books away when I'm done reading them.	0
If you could choose a statistic to see above everyone's head, what would you choose?	Their IQ. Or some equivalent number so I know to turn around if I walk into a room full of imbeciles.	How many times you've seen each other before. It would be interesting to see how often you see someone who perhaps you don't remember, but may have seen many times in the past, etc.	0
[Serious] Women, what are common ways unfamiliar men make you uncomfortable or creeped out?	Honestly? If I'm out in public, like in line, or something, don't try to strike up a conversation with me out of nowhere. I just want to be left alone. Your commentary is not necessary. If you do this, and I don't respond in a friendly way, then just drop it. Don't try to continue a conversation with someone who doesn't want to have one. EDIT: All the niceguys who don't want to change their behavior to make people around them more comfortable are here to remind me that they're nice and shouldn't have to change. Why did I expect any different on reddit?	I'm not sure how common this is, but when I took my car in to my dealership for my service, I gave my keys to the mechanic and went inside to wait without saying anything to him. Late that day, I got a friend request on social media. He had apparantly taken my professional car file to figure out who I was and find me. This file also has my address and phone, so I was pretty worried and creeped out. I also used to have a boss who only hired women and took their addresses off their resumes to follow them to their homes and hit on them. Addresses on resumes aren't as useful anymore. I wouldn't recommend putting it on there.	0
What things happen in movies often that are very unrealistic?	Not exactly movies, but in cartoons. Quicksand turned out to be much less of a problem in the real world than I thought it would be.	High schoolers having 2 minute classes followed by half-hour breaks to go to their lockers. Edit: I am looking at you, *Glee*.	0
My dad's friend thinks HIV/AIDS was introduced by the government to "exterminate the gays." Reddit, what are the craziest conspiracies you've heard?	A friend of mine has a whole theory that 9/11 was staged so we could start a war... Weirdest part. The theory makes sense xD	I have a very conservative religious classmate who has predicted the gaypocalypse. He insists that if we start allowing gay and lesbian marriage, eventually EVERYONE will become gay/lesbian and there will be no more heterosexual unions, thus no more babies will be born and humanity will die out. IMO, with people like him on the loose we are WAY more likely to Darwin ourselves out before any form of apocalypse ever occurs.	0
[Serious] How did you get the girl?	First became attractive, then got a few girls. Then I became an asshole who also happened to be attractive. Let's just say it took me twenty minutes to write this comment because of all the perfect ten pussy that's being waved in my face at the moment.	Blind date. A friend and her boyfriend invited her to a movie. She had no idea she was being set up. I got a text saying "hey, I know this girl that wants to touch your penis." We're married and have been together for 7 years.	0
What isn't illegal but should be?	Motorcycles splitting lanes. Every morning I see a motorcyclist speeding through rush hour traffic, waving and weaving through cars like the chase scene in Return of the Jedi. How the fuck is this legal?	Smartphone ads that are really hard to close and if you touch a tiny bit wrong, get taken to the appstore	0
What was your best "I told you so" moment?	I knew my best friends boyfriend was a cunt. I kept it to myself because essentially at the beginning he made her happy, after about a year it all changed and his cuntyness became more apparent. They broke up and it was now common knowledge that he in fact was a cunt. In my mind I was screaming I told you so, out loud I was acting surprised.	Not mine, but my mother's. I was around 9 years old playing nerf soccer in the hallway with my dad. Mom walks out of the kitchen and starts yelling at us. "Stop horsing around. One of you is going to get hurt." We ignore her and keep playing. About 30 seconds later I go to shoot the ball and my toe gets caught in the carpet. Crack. Broken toe. Mom was PISSED.	0
Cab drivers of Reddit. What is your Best/Craziest story?	When I take cabs I like to ask the drivers for their best stories - usually makes for a good conversation. One driver told me about a customer he'd had, a guy who really didn't like flying. The guy offered the driver $800 to drive him from Sydney to Melbourne (a 10-12 hour drive for those who don't live in Australia). Once they got to Melbourne, the guy got out and did a runner.	I'm not a cab driver, but I am an online cam girl. I did was in a taxi once, online, and flashing customers for money. My guys were being awesome that day and my tits were out the whole ride, we were joking about it and I told him all about what I do and asked permission, of course, before hanging my boobs out all over his car. My driver, when I offered him a tip at the end of the ride, said something along the lines of "You've already given me the best tip!"	1
Young Redditors, I have spent $75,000 on my child's education. She graduates in three weeks. This weekend she told me her career plans were to "waitress at a more upscale restaurant." How do I deal?	Well... Not to be rude, but you should have spent more time with her developing her character, rather than making $$ to "educate" her.	Let her have it it builds character anyawy to work a shit job. Won't hurt her in the future to have that experience. Check back with her only if she stagnates on it.	0
What was your most surprisingly nice celebrity encounter?	I usually like to give an honest response and my two cents on every askreddit post. Unfortunately I've never had a celebrity encounter and I'm sure most people are in the same boat.	I was bowling at the top of the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood, and my group accidentally got another group's drink order. Turns out it was the table right next to us. I go up to this kinda short guy and tap him on the shoulder and say, "Hey man, I think we may have gotten your guys' drinks by accident." Guy turns around and it's Ludacris. He says, "No worries brother, keep 'em. We out. Y'all have a good night aight." Thanks Lud!	0
Reddit, what time are you going to wake up tomorrow and what for?	7am, and I wake up at the same time every day, because life is too short to spend it sleeping in.	10am organising a poker game and a roast beef dinner plus waiting for 2 cases of Port to come as a gift from myself with the message 'happy birthday Tim, lots of love Michael Jackson'	0
Employers of reddit, what is your "maybe we shouldn't have hired that guy" story?	Hired a dude who was supposedly a Journeyman Electrician for 15 yrs. We were doing a very high end tenant finish for a highly prominate architect, everything was to be the best finish and install. He was cutting in 4 inch recessed can lights with a sawzall. Shit was hacked to shit. Then he made some lewd comment to the designer (young attractive lady) and in the same 15 minutes, was pissing into a Gatorade bottle in the middle of the room. We let him go after the 2nd day.	We have had tons of them. The most common is a cancerous employee. I'm getting pretty good at detecting them now, but my colleague hired one, and this girl's near-immediate negativity spread into the entire team. They ended up having to basically fire 8 people, and it all started with one rotten person. As soon as somebody starts complaining outwardly about the company and how unfair it is or how much underpaid they all are- and trying to pull all the employees around them to their side. You gotta get them isolated and out of there stat. It was pretty sad to watch, 3 of the 8 people were really good employees and could have received good promotions, but ended up getting sucked into the vortex of negativity. Their morale and quality of work dropped through the floor and were eventually written up then removed or quit.	1
What habit is generally percieved as healthy, but really isn't ?	Constantly sanitizing everything. Certain things need to be sanitized for safe use but a lot of bacteria that keeps our immune systems functioning/improving are destroyed in the process, leaving us susceptible to diseases we could have been immune to.	Marathon and long distance running really isn't as good for you as many people think it is. I mean, yes, there are some people who happen to have bodies great for it. But there are also lots of people who can do serious damage to their bodies running long distance (have a friend who destroyed the cartilage in his knees at a young age from running long distance, for one).	1
Heavy sleepers of reddit, What is the most interesting or strangest thing you've ever slept through?	"Oh man, you missed the fire alarm" "What, what fire alarm?!" "It happened this morning" "Why didnt you wake me!" "Because you sleep naked"	I once slept through a fireworks display that was set off less than 10 metres from me. But that is less surprising if you've ever heard me snore ...	1
What is are the things you cannot tolerate about your parents and that which you won't do to your children?	I will teach my children to argue rationally. My house growing up, it was dad shouting until everyone else decided to pretend he was right so he would calm down. I want my kids to be able to have a calm discussion with me. That's a life skill I had to learn a lot later in life.	Indoctrinate them with mumbo-jumbo about some magic sky fairy and drag them along to grovel before statues of it on a Sunday.	1
Folks who work in grocery/retail stores, what codes do you announce over the intercom that aren't in your handbook?	Any time we have a suspected shoplifter, someone announces "Roger, you're needed in (insert department)" over the PA, promptly followed by numerous bored employees showing up. It's all very subtle. Roger is the name of our store's pet turtle.	I shout "Nine Eleven" whenever someone accidentally knocks something off a shelf. It's a reference to the September 11th attack on the World Trade Centers.	1
What are some lessons you learned the "hard way" as a kid or teenager?	Personally, I've learned that you always have her shower before you eat out your girlfriend. I did it once, then felt like shit for the rest of the next day.	If you know a girl online and for 2 years she comes up with multiple excuses as to why her webcam and microphone won't work, and she has no phone... It's a dude.	0
What "long con" are you currently executing?	she doesn't love me anymore. after three years, she doesn't love me anymore. oh, she loves me. she's just not *in* love with me. whatever in the fuck that means. anyway. i love her. with all my heart. i'm IN love with her. but i'm me. i get mad at things people don't see, and my anger colours everything. ruins everything. my long con is being patient and understanding. and being gentler with people. and her. if i pretend long enough, maybe it'll happen. if i try hard enough, maybe i won't be me anymore. and maybe one day she'll love me again.	I am moving my bosses desk back less than 1/8th an inch every day. Been doing it for a couple of months now and she still hasn't noticed.	0
What's the dumbest tech related thing you've ever head someone say?	"amd processors are better for gaming because they run hotter". -lady at a computer parts store. I want to correct her but politely nodded and got out of the store within 2 minutes.	I work in IT and have probably blocked out the stupidest things over the years. Although the other day I had to unplug a printer to move it to the other side of the room. As I was walking away with it in my arms, cables dangling, someone told me they couldn't print something. I kind of chuckled and glanced self-explanatorily at the printer. She stared at me. "But.. why isn't it printing?" she said, nonplussed.	0
Teachers and professors of reddit, what is the most embarrassing/NSFW thing you've done or seen while teaching?	Elementary school kid pulled his dick out in the cafeteria and tried to poke a girl with it. Shut that shit down faster than a black father makes a single mother. Teaching at a majority minority title 1 school in the ghetto makes you appreciate the 2-parent families, they're usually the ones with well controlled children. 7/10 uncontrollable male students didn't have a father at home and 3/10 lived with extended family and not with their mom/dad. Edit: forgive the people who assume racism, because everything is black and white in their popular narrative of current situations and socioeconomic realities faced every day by teachers of innercity schools. A little dark humor gets us through the day. Sorry for disrupting their puppies and rainbows view of teachers.	I am a PhD student who teaches undergrads. During one of my first lectures, a male student came to class 3-4 minutes late. He sat down in the front row, opened up his laptop, and porn sounds started playing loudly. He slammed it shut and put his head on the desk for the rest of class. It was so hard not to laugh and keep lecturing. Life pro tip for my undergrads- make sure you close out of the porn when you're done.	0
Something about you is so unique that you can consider it a superpower, what is yours?	I have a photographic memory. What I do is intensely study the details on a paper or diagram, write it out 2-3 times, and then its in my memory forever.	It's not me, but my friend. He has the power to attract even the most shy or aggressive cat and turn them into a lap cat. My fiance and I have a cat that avoids all contact with people, but when my friend comes over this cat comes out and lays in his lap. There must be something about him, because he is a pussy magnet.	0
What was the "incident" in your house growing up?	We were dog sitting for my aunt when their new huge dog had a case of the shits... All over our new carpet the smell never came out and we got new carpet I will forever hate huge dogs Fuck u jasmine	Papa overreacted to his football team losing and did 10k in damages to the house and family vehicles in about 5 minutes. Pretty awkward dinner.	0
People who decided, "Fuck it, I'm going for it." How did it go and what did you go for?	I decided to post an answer on r/askreddit. So far i haven't recieved any upvotes because I haven't submitted the comment yet. edit: now I have	Pretty shy.. thought a friend of a friend was pretty cute. Said fuck it and asked for her number. We ended up dating for a bit but ultimately did not work out. However, I have been much more confident with dating and approaching new people.	0
People who can't say no, what is the worst thing you ended up doing for someone?	I went to a Nebraska Cornhuskers game with Zooey Deschanel on a whim. I ended up being detained by the FBI due to some other suspicious activity that may or may not have been related to inability to say "no" to things.	I sang two sets of songs at a crowded restaurant while my struggling artist friend played guitar and backed me up. He begged me to do it, and I figured when he heard how terrible I sounded at our "rehearsal" he would let me back out. But no. The looks on the faces of the patrons (somewhere between sympathy and dumbfoundedness) will haunt me until I die.	0
What "black market" did kids at your school run?	When I was a kid, I'd borrow pencils from people a few days before a test, and then when someone didn't have one the day of, I'd "lease" them for a nickel. I got caught when I leased a recognizable pencil to the same kid I borrowed from. Stupid me.	In middle school every Wednesday there was dollar cookie day at lunch. Every couple weeks this one kid brought like $50 and got a shit load of cookies and just gave them out for free. We called him the cookie king	0
Redditors of Reddit, what’s your personal experience of “One man’s trash is another man’s treasure”?	Can I say "me"? I was my own trash, I fucked up my life real decent, I was gonna kill myself, for years I dreamed about having a switch to turn it all off. Over time I settled into a weird form of optimistic nihlisim where I don't really have anywhere further to dig, it's fucked up and not where I'd choose to be from the start, but it's a pretty intriguing silver lining. I got time, cause I don't really care about mine.	My roommate was rich and didn’t like her mattress pad and thought it was “cheap” so she gave it to me and it changed my life. It was a plush, foam pad that improved the horrible bed I had to sleep on.	0
What was the plot twist in your family?	I'm in love with my cousin and nobody knows. We don't see each other much, but when we do, there's some serious flirty vibes there.	My grandfather had an illegitimate daughter on his milk route, paid her mother hush money and bribed my dad with candy not to tell anyone where he had been, after being taken on the route when he was five or six and playing with his half sister.	0
Anyone ever find a dead body? If so what's your story?	I watched my dad die in our living room when I was 7, nearly 2 minutes after kissing him on the head and telling him I loved him. He was an alcoholic and suffered from pancreatic cancer and liver failure.	When I was in 7th grade me and a couple of friends were skipping school. We decided to take a nap at the cemetery and upon waking up I noticed a bag. I went to take a look. Opened it up and I flipped shit! There was a fucking severed hand. I then proceeded to put the bag in one of my friends backpack haven't heard from him since.	1
What TV shows lost its magic after a producer or actor left the show?	Community stumbled pretty hard when Dan Harmon was fired. When he came back a season later, he did his best to course correct, but the tone had changed and only got more melancholy as it went into the final season. It was still funny, but different.	Oh without a doubt "Spongebob". Steven hilenburg (idk how to spell his name) died and the diffrence between season 9 and season 10 is insane. I hate season 10 and above so much I cannot express it in words. It's targeting young kids with the stupid faces and lame plots, they ruined every character for me and I hate it so much. Edit: oops, nothing to do with Stephen's death, but season 10 still sucks.	1
What is the most pretentious thing you have ever heard someone say?	Me: ...What are you going to school for? Pretentious Guy: Philosophy Me : Right on. What are you planning on doing with your degree? Pretentious Guy: (incredulously) Uh... Be a philosopher...!	My first interaction with my new roommate in South Africa went like this: Me: So, where are you from Steve? Steve: Nowhere. Me: Um...... what? Steve: Well I've traveled to so many places that I'm not really "from" anywhere anymore. Me: Where were you born? Steve: Ohio Me: Where did you go to school? Steve: Ohio Me: You are from Ohio Steve. I busted his balls pretty hard about it and he turned out to be a really cool guy. Edit: Yes everyone, I could understand that if he had moved around his whole life this would be a difficult question to answer. He was born in Ohio and lived there until he was 18. Steve was 100% from Ohio.	0
What person do you hate the most right now?	The Koch Bros. anyone? Fuck those greedy silver spoon libertarians. Seriously though they are a large reason for the direction the US is headed in the last few and probably next 2 years.	Past-me. Past-me is a fucking dick, he has no regard for future-me. If I ever get a hold of past-me, I'd fuck his shit right up.	0
What useless skill are you abnormally good at?	I swear, someone filled out my IRL character sheet randomly or something. But, Hula hooping. I'm a 30-year-old guy. I can do all the flourishes. Spins, whips, chest rolls, elbow passes. And I could do most all of it with ease from basically the very first time I picked a hula hoop up. Just came to me naturally. I can't explain it. -_-	Remembering minute details. I had an online friend who let his real name slip by accident. I knew for months until he decided to tell me himself and then I told him I already knew it and I didn't mind that he gave a different name. I played a memory game 2 years ago where everyone said a word then said a word that started with the last letter of the previous word. I still remember the first 10 words years later even though I lost.	1
Wedding attendees of Reddit, what's the funniest or most awkward moment you remember from a ceremony or reception?	You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My mom was marrying Jeff, and they asked me to be ring bearer. And I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet. A long story short, Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that, after the ceremony that dog peed on everything...and nobody said, "Boo".	My dad was the best man at this one wedding. During the reception, when he was about to give a speech, he forgot the bride's name. He spent a good ten seconds hastily whispering to himself random names of girls that could possibly be the wife. Since he was holding the mic, everyone in the room could hear it. To others, it sounded like a long list of the groom's past girlfriends.	0
What are your ridiculous yet haunting fears?	That my poop gains life at night and wants to be back inside me. My ass is closed and so they want to come in through my mouth.	That the people around are reading my mind. Sometimes I have to change what I'm thinking of just so people don't get offended	0
What is something you found before it blew up?	To a lot of my peers, Dragon Age. **Nobody** gave a shit about the series back when I first bought Origins in 2010. In comes Inquisition, everyone is raving about it. I don't really mind, but when they act all condescendingly when they talk about it to me, **THAT** annoys me, to say the least.	I was running a simple webserver back in 1996 when I started noticing a bunch of hits from this new search engine at Stanford called Backrub... which was tweaked a little and soon became known as Google. Edit: English is tough sometimes.	0
People who make small talk while in bathroom stalls, WHY?	Sometimes if I’m drunk at a bar and there’s a lot of people waiting in the bathroom, I’ll stare at my neighbours dick while I’m peeing and say “holy shit this guys awesome at peeing! You must practise like three-four times a day eh? Hey everybody come check this out! It’s crazy!” N shit like that. Always to amuse myself.	There's a gentleman at my office who whispers to himself while defecating. I can not stand it, because it is a constantly low hum of barely audible-words that sometimes include phrases like "Jesus Christ" and "There's the big one". I hate him on a deep and intimate level.	0
Whats the hardest riddle you know?	My grandmother posed this one frequently, and it stumped me through my entire childhood: Q. What can go up a chimney down, but can't go down a chimney up? A. >!An umbrella.!<	Not a serous one. Q. What is green, pinned to a wall and squeaks? A. >!a herring. Why it is green? Because it is old. Why it squeaks? So it is harder to guess !<	1
Which movie hero was really the villain?	Frodo Sauron made his own nice piece of jewelry that matched all the other powerful leaders of the worlds pieces. In his fight for independence, he lost it, and some asshole decided to keep it for himself. After years of looking for it and offering rewards, some dick steals it and gives it to his nephew who decides the ring is ugly and he doesnt like it, so he goes on a trip with some buddies to destroy it.	The Man in the Yellow Hat in Curious George. He actually went to Africa and kidnapped George in a sack. George was scared and crying through the first book and really did not want to go with the Man on the Yellow Hat. He attempted to escape several times.	0
Women of reddit, what small addition or change to your beauty routine totally changed your life?	I stopped wearing makeup. We are piling on chemicals onto our faces all day long and they cannot breathe. I stopped wearing makeup and my face brightened. I also started thinking about my blemishes as signs that I needed to change something; (e.g. breakouts? Okay, what did I eat this week that may have caused this to happen?)	I splurged and bought "salon quality" shampoo and conditioner. I always thought it was a gimmick; why pay 30 dollars when I can get the same stuff for 99 cents? 30 dollar bottles of shampoo or conditioner last me a whole year and my hair is so healthy and pretty now!	0
Carnies of Reddit: We all know the games at carnivals and fairs are rigged. What are some tricks you use and how do we win?	The games where you shoot water at a target and blow up the balloon, go for the one with the new balloon because it hasn't been stretched a bunch of times and pops easier.	i actually worked a summer at cedar point doing games maybe ill do an AMA about how each game is rigged if i get enough upvotes	1
What is the best opening of a novel you know?	I answered the phone and Susan Rodriguez said, “They've taken our daughter.” Dresden Files Book 12, Changes. I was in such a sudden shock the hard-cover book slipped from my fingers to land on my cat... (she took it like a pro, and is totally fine. But now is leery of the bookshelf)	The sun rose slowly, as if it wasn't sure it was worth the effort. The Light Fantastic by Terry Pratchett	0
Guys of reddit, do you like it when girls make the first move?	I'm going to go ahead and predict that there will be 10,000 comments in this thread and that 9998 of them will be some variation of "Yes"	I guess it depends on what you mean by the first move. A girl asking me out is pretty much an immediate turn-off. On the flip-side, I don't like going in completely blind. I'd at least like to have a good idea that the attraction is mutual before I make a complete fool of myself. **tl;dr:** No. Not really.	1
For those 55 or older, how has the double-income-no-kids route worked out?	I am 66, wife is 61, married 37 years no children. Sometimes I regret not having children, but we would still make the choice to be childless if we had it to do over. The financial benefits are huge and you have the freedom to travel, make radical life changes without worrying about adverse effects on the children. We are retired, have no debt at all, money in the bank, good insurance and reasonably good health. We did however host 5 foreign exchange students for a year each. That was as close to, parenting as I want to get. The down side, I will die a lonely old man with no family around. edit: I am gratified and amazed at the very nice responses to my post. I don't actually worry about my death very much; it is too far in the future.	Regardless what answer you get here, no one without kids can possibly say, with any level of accuracy, what they're "missing" by NOT having kids. It's not something non-parents have any idea about. Seriously.	1
Men of reddit, what's the creepiest thing a woman has ever said to you?	"You have one year to decide if you're going to marry me." First date - Dinner had just been ordered. My response: "I'm still trying to decide on a second date..."	"my pussy itches." Uh, if that was a come on I don't really get down with infected vagene. I don't know what she was thinking. In her defense she was a raging crackhead.	1
Redditors who are still chasing your dream, what is it and what have you achieved?	i want to be the president of the united states. shit, if donald trump can do it, so can I!	I've wanted to become a pilot since I was a kid, but A) I thought I was going to have to join the military to do so and B) I thought my fear of heights would hold me back. Now I work for a company that offers Private Pilot's License training for dirt cheap and I've been on several flights in our planes to find that I'm not afraid of flying! I have $700/$1000 to get this jumpstarted and I couldn't be more excited!	0
How do you make friends as an adult?	Same way as a kid really. Go to sports clubs or book clubs or whatever you like and just work your way from there, you need to be with people to make friends, even if you're shy, like me, if you're passionate about something use that to your advantage and find people you can relate to, maybe host a barbecue and invite the neighbours I dunno, only thing I know for sure is you can only make friends with people around to make friends with. Also! You can always hide on the Internet. I'll be yo friend son.	you dont. everyone who tries to be your 'friend' as an adult is really just trying to sell you something/gain some kind of advantage over you. stick with the crew you got as a teenager	1
You are going to receive 3k usd a month for the rest of your life. What do you do?	- Youtube Channel - Photography Blog - Daily Twitch Stream. I'll split my days into 4 parts. - Sleep - Going outdoors to take photos and videos - Editing of above-said photos and videos and uploading them - Streaming video games on Twitch That's my current retirement plan.	Put 1k a month into a savings account, pay rent and bills with the rest, figure out what I'd like to do with my life now I don't have to worry about 95% of my daily stresses.	0
Parents of Reddit, please be honest. HAE truly disliked their child and held the child in contempt?	I don't understand this ridiculous concept of unconditional love. Can we be realistic here? My parents were quite disdainful of this concept, and rightfully so: if I turned out to a be a sadistic asshole, they would not have loved me. Or just take it to the extreme: if you spawned the next vile Hitler, could you really love him? Plueeeeze.	My mom confessed to me once that she never really liked my brother from an early age. He was always a difficult, rebellious kid, and as an adult he's been in and out of prison and flirted with white supremacist groups. Nature or nurture, I don't know which.	0
What is an idiom in a foreign language that becomes hilarious when translated to English?	Less of an idiom and more of a term, in German we use the word *Handschuh* for glove, which literally translates to "hand shoe".	"Yo tengo uno pollo de queso en mis pantalones" Which roughly translated means "It's not your baby if it's in my pants."	1
What was the rumor about you in high school? Was it true?	When I was in highschool I got my tonsils removed and was out of school for about a month. My brother convinced the entire school that I had got Gonorrhea and that's why i was sick.	People thought I was a lesbian. I'm not. (They were half right though, I am bi, and they figured it out before I even admitted it to myself.)	1
Which jobs are not as glamorous as everybody thinks?	Private Investigator. Picture spending hours at a time in the back of a minivan with tinted windows watching a house through a camera, and having absolutely nothing happen. Having to pee in a bottle, and often not being able to run the heat or AC despite miserable weather conditions. That's like 90% of what I did as a PI. edit - spellnig	Worker at the Cincinnati zoo. One week 11 beautiful gorillas are roaming around but the next only 10. Dicks out	1
Who is the most badass person in history?	Jesus Fucking Christ Never in the course of human history has one pacifist been the cause of more death (in His name)	Napoleon visited the tomb of Frederick the Great after his victory against the Fourth Coalition. This is what he allegedly said: "Gentlemen, if this man was still alive I would not be here". He was praising Frederick's tactical genius.	0
What are subtle signs of wealth?	My CEO is very wealthy. What stands out about him - he often smiles and seems to be pleased with his life - his clothes fit well and you do not see the logos all over them, but you can tell the quality - he probably comes from a family that was used to be wealthy for a longer time and put a lot of weight on treating other people well - he is nice to all emplyees. You know, the Obama way. I myself am also twice as wealthy as the average petson at my company (i inherited a flat, so i dont have to pay the mortgage, that can consume up to 1/3 of ones monthly income and we earn quite a lot) but i also dont show off.	When people never talk about money. If they're not talking about it, it means they don't have to think about it.	0
Reddit, what's your harmless little secret?	Dated Katy Perry. I am not famous. I am obsessed with it because it was the one time in my life I felt special, and it was missing completely from my memory due to a head injury. I have to delete my account, because this isn't helping me any. I thought it would be kathartic, but it's just helping the inner child stay indoors while the man has to drive the chariot now. The higher self is in the caisson. I need to unyoke my black horse from my head, and yoke my white horse for my heart, and live in The World. It's been real. I am worthy.	When my parents' cat started get senile and go to the toilet in the shower, I would always clean it up without mentioning it to anyone, since I wanted to hold off him getting put down for as long as possible.	0
What's the scariest real life ghost/paranormal/ unexplained experience that you or some one you know has had?	One time I was sitting in my room listening to the radio and nickelback came on. I was so shaken I had to turn the radio off and cry into my pillow for a few hours.	Used to work at a shoe store where the former manager was a serious workaholic and worked there until the day she died. Everyone said she haunted the place and I never believed them until I worked there for a few months. Every morning the display shoes that were straight the night before would be turned all around or on the floor in the middle of the isles. The back door to the stock room could be heard opening and closing when the store was empty and when we checked no one was back there or anywhere in the store. We would always go through the whole store before closing and make sure all the shoe boxes were straight and facing the right way, and every night once the lights were off and we were walking out the door we could hear shoe boxes being shuffled around on the shelves.	0
Employees of Reddit: What awesome perk/benefit do you get from your job?	I used to work in radio. Thousands of people would hear my opinions and I wouldn't have to hear theirs. It was great.	I used to work as a pidgeon tamer. It was *extremely tough work* (the darn birds would always put up a fight when I scrambled around trying to grab their beaks!). The main perk? Pidgeon for dinner every night, on the house. As in, I killed them and ate them. For dinner. **TL;DR Pidgeon meat for dinner** *PS: Pidegeon tastes like the rarest steak in France, with extra pepper*	1
Redditors, what are some of the creepiest, unexplainable, and darkest corners of the internet that you've visited in the past year?	For me it's gotta be One man One Icepick. Do *not* look up that video unless you have an incredibly high tolerance to gross shit. Essentially, someone holds a guy captive after drugging him, stabs him with an ice pick, cuts off his limbs, and fucks the dead body. I *really* recommend not watching it, it's incredibly graphic. Edit: words Edit: There's one man one jar, too. It's pretty weird but not as bad.	I heard about Tor browser and figured I'd check it out. People make the deep web sound like this cool place with a bunch of markets and libraries and strange stuff. Nope. It's like 90% straight up CP and 10% CP sites pretending to be about other things. Honestly if you tell me you use Tor, my opinion of you goes down. Yeah, I know people use it for other stuff, but I don't see how any of it's advantages could be worth subjecting yourself to crap like that on a regular basis.	1
What's your favorite recipe that takes less than 15 minutes to prepare?	Ordering a pizza **Ingredients**: Phone Pizza place choice and phone number Order **How to make**: Call restaurant and give them your order Wait for the pizza to arrive Enjoy!	English muffin pizzas in the toaster oven. English muffin halves as the crust, add sauce, fresh mozz (or any cheese you have on hand will work), add toppings, cook until done. Great snack!	0
Ladies, what are some secret beauty tips that you know?	Everyone won't agree.... But don't wear make up. I never do and get compliments on how nice my skin looks all the time. On the rare occasion that I do I keep it very minimal. Just wash your face every day and moisturize.	If you use a face wash like Clearasil or some other acne-fighter, use it to wash your armpits. It kills the smelly bacteria and it won't be a huge deal if you forget deodorant afterwards.	0
What's an opinion you have that is popular irl, but controversial on reddit?	That having children is one of our most basic drives, and wanting children is completely normal and not a reflection on a person's intelligence.	That I disagree with anything/everything that has to do with homosexuality. Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who does online, so due to my unpopular opinion I would never bring it up, especially not on Reddit. Edit: shit	1
As a barber, I purposely dont dust off the hair on your face if I dont like you just to make you suffer. What are your job confessions?	i try to sneak more chips into the bag/more cheese on quesadillas/more meat onto any meal if someone is extra nice to me	I work at a Goodwill, and if someone comes up to me with an item that doesn't have a price on it, I will assume you are a dirty, whoring thief and price it much higher than it is worth. This is mainly due to the fact that many more people than is morally right actually do rip price tags off to save/make more money on the resell. Unless of course, you are nice and speak proper English, then I will cut you a break and knock it down a notch or two.	1
To you, what is the most attractive feature of the opposite sex?	Voice. A groan. A laugh. An "mmmmnh". A giggle. A sigh. A whimper. A gasp. A moan. Dirty talk. Flirty talk. I love you talk. I want you talk. When you touch her and you know you're the one making her make those sounds. When she makes those sounds that tell you she wants to be touching you. God help me, I'm powerless when a girl's got a sexy voice. ...But outside of that I'd have to say I would find the most erotic part of a woman is the boobies.	I have a fart fetish, so a girl's fart smell (really only for girls I'm attracted to). Somebody on 4chan put it perfectly. "Girls spend a lot of time and money on perfumesand fragrances but they can't change the dirty smell that comes out of their butts."	1
Why do parents always blame tv, movies, and games for shootings and bad behavior? Shouldn't they be the ones to teach their kids whats fact and fiction?	Dude the US has a whole system to shift blame with their frivolous lawsuits. What makes you think parents would actually blame themselves instead of shifting the blame to something else?	My parents used the phrase "tv magic." I was taught from the youngest age that when I see something on tv, it is generally not a representation of real life. When I was a kid, probably up till the age of 13 or so, my parents would watch things before I watched them. That doesn't mean I couldn't see things - it just meant that after I watch a movie or TV show, my parents knew what to talk to me about. And yes, both my parents worked. They didn't have unlimited time. They just thought it was important that I was exposed to things, but understood how they compared to real life.	0
What are the funniest/weirdest/scariest things you've heard someone say in their sleep?	My buddy started saying "Oh my God! OH MY GOD!" over and over again, sounding really frightened. Eventually I told him to be quiet. Five minutes or so later he said, in a wonderful Indian accent "You're a naughty, naught girl, aren't you?" Magical.	My dad was sleeping on the couch and my siblings and i were watching tv. He farted in his sleep and started singing Rocky Mountain High from John Denver. We were literally like this o_0. Then like this >.< Then LOL.	1
Bartenders of reddit, what is the smoothest pick up line you've ever heard?	"I'm not Asian but I'll still eat your pussy!" "My dick just died can I bury it in your pus**" "As long as I have a face you'll have a place to sit!" "Hey girl, the human body has 206 bones... You want 1 more ;)" okay these will never work, and I've never been to a bar	Sort of an anti-pickup line but I witnessed a drunk girl get decimated at the bar one night. She was hot, and one of those "haha you're cute you should buy me a drink" type girls. Some dumpy looking dude walks up to the bar and orders a Corona and she pulls the whole "And put a rum and coke on there for me!", insinuating that he should buy her next drink. He looked at her casually and says "Make it a rum and diet." and then just walks away. I was speechless. I'd never seen him before and haven't seen him since, sometimes I wonder if he ever existed at all.	0
We've seen some no-no's for the guests attending a wedding, so what are some no-no's for the HOSTS of the wedding: the bride and groom?	Don't get mad when a vegetarian RSVPs no when you didn't bother to include a veggie option. I'm not going to eat dinner rolls and pretend to like you when I could be doing things I actually enjoy. Go ahead and unfriend me, fuck you.	Don't invite people you don't want there just to please others, particularly if they're likely to provoke you into a full blown verbal argument.	0
What is something your parents did when you were younger but now you're older you're completely against?	Smoke inside the car with us kids in the back without any seat belts. That shit was fucked up. I couldn't ride a skateboard without hockey gear and a big ass helmet, but lounging in the backseat of a car while my mum and dad smoked was ok.	Forced me to go to church even after I started giving reasons to not go other than I don't wanna go. I went to church every Sunday and youth group every Wednesday until I moved out.	1
Redditors, what is the "please don't do this" in your country for tourists?	Bring drugs in, get caught by the border control, and then try to smear my country for sending you to the hangman. It's everywhere on the internet that we've a strict no drug policy, and it carries a capital punishment. Border control is not really the place to argue about the failed war on drugs, decriminalisation of drugs, taking weed decreases use drug usage, lsd helps psychiatric illness etc. If you smuggle drugs in for personal use or to sell it, get caught, and get hung, you deserve it, don't lord your first world crap over me.	NYC resident here. Do not trust anyone who: -tries to hand you a CD (it's a scam) -appears to be a Buddhist monk handing you a prayer card (it's a scam) -tries to sell you a MetroCard (it's a scam) -is in Times Square and offers you a ticket to a free movie screenings (it's Scientology)	0
What are the pettiest, most pointless things that people argue about?	Brand loyalty. Gamers and their consoles, rednecks and their trucks (Calvin pissing on a Chevy logo stuck to a Ford window), techies and their phones, and an impossible to list all of them list. Who f-ing cares what brand you have vs. what someone else has? I certainly don't.	how words are pronounced, yes i get that there is a right way and a wrong way but it's definitely not worth arguing about. BY THE WAY, it's pronounced gif as in "gift", not as "jif". Just because that guy invented the **G**raphical Interchange Format (note the pronunciation of graphical), doesn't mean he gets to decide how letters are pronounced. Don't agree? come at me	1
What is a fairly common opinion that people regularly share on reddit, but you don't hear people share that opinion much in real life?	In real life, transgender people are freaks who are pretending to be the opposite sex because they're "confused" or just getting off on it and trans women deserve to die. Nobody wants to even try to understand.	It seems to me that everyone on Reddit thinks that stepping on a LEGO block is the most painful feeling in the universe. It isn't that bad people...	0
I found out today that my students now very little about countries and capitals (one of them thought Japan was the capital of China). They told me they didn't want to learn "that stuff", because they "didn't need it anyway". Do you think some basic geographical knowledge is necessary?	You need to tell those kids to shut the hell up because you had to take calculus and chemistry because you want to be a well rounded smart adult who doesn't look like a complete ignorant ass hat like many oxygen suckers walking the earth today.	I like Miss Teen South Carolina's position on this: > I personally believe the U.S. Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don't have maps, and I believe that our education like such as South Africa and, uh, the Iraq everywhere like, such as and... I believe that they should, our education over here in the U.S. should help the U.S., err, uh, should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries, so we will be able to build up our future for our...	0
What should you NOT do when you go the the United States?	If you visit the Midwest - generally do not accept any offer on the first or second offer. It is generally considered polite in the upper midwest, to refuse an offer 2 times and accept on the third. Do not feel obliged when people keep offering up until the 4th time, then it should be considered a request that you accept their offer as that is what they want. Edit: clarified?	After being pulled over, do not step out of the car without the officer coming near you, seeing your hands on the steering wheel and telling you to do so. I'm from Turkey and here you are kind of supposed to step out and walk to the police car after being pulled over. Friend did that in the U.S. and the officer immediately took it as a threat, pointing his gun towards him, yelling him to lie down on the floor...	0
Reddit, what is the most painfully embarrassing, creeper-in-hindsight thing you did as a lovestruck teenager to a member the opposite sex?	Not me, but my friend would take creepshots with his flip phone...it was pretty funny when I told the girl...her reaction was priceless :D	I'm surprised I didn't get in any trouble for this, but I was very much the introverted (read - stalkerish) type of admirer when I was younger. I was around 14, fat, not appealing to any girl, but there was this attractive girl who was nice to me. So, I did what I thought would be romantic and sweet. I hacked into her school computer and left her a word document containing the words 'I love you' over and over again. And I'm talking over 500 times. Yeah...	0
[Serious] Kids whose parents had secret lives, what were they and how did you find out?	Someone once called my mom Sandy and my mom answered. My mom's name is Chris. I don't have any other information than that. I am still confused about it.	It wasn't really a secret but I was raised by my dad, I knew my mom but not very well. Fast forward a bunch of years and while I know her better I really don't care too but can't cut her out completely and it drives my crazy. She's crazy.	1
Have you ever found a reddit post about yourself? If so, what happened after?	I found a post that I think was about me. I did a women's studies course because I am a male feminist. I came in first place but said that the award should go to a woman. Some people in the class didn't appreciate the gesture felt pretty bad man smh	An inappropriate conversation I had on tinder was posted by the dude and it made it to the front page. He didn't block out my name or picture so a ton of people I knew saw it and it got embarrassing real quick. The real kicker is that it also got popular on other social media forums so it can forever haunt me.	0
How do you deal with bratty kids?	The back of my hand usually works. That was for the Lulz of course. I find reasoning with a child works, well that's if they're not under 4 years of age or stupid. Then I just revert to my previous statement.	I once threatened my kids that if they ever fucked with me, I would show up at their school in costume. It worked.	0
Non-drinkers, was there one moment where you thought, "Nope, this isn't for me"?	I don't mean to be that dick that always tries to convince non drinkers to drink, but not drinking alcohol because you don't want to throw up and make a complete arse of yourself is like not drinking water because you don't want hyponatremia. I mean, if you don't want to drink, don't drink, but if you use moderation this doesn't happen.	Yeah once I came home drunk to my 2 year old son. I decided I didn't want to be _that_ parent.	0
[Serious] What is the scariest experience in your life that made you believe, or at least made you question the existence of the paranormal?	i can recall things i should not one thing that is infamous for me is i say i rmemeber my dad white car with a busted radio and missing tires blue stripe looked like a taxi the issue is they had the car long before i was born and it wasnt even something like memories from the womb it was a genuine thing that i should not be able to remember but i do i see vivid images of it after that i started beliving in the supernatural alot more	I was lying in bed reading Jane Eyre about 6 months ago and I have a set of wardrobes directly adjacent to my bed. Above the wardrobes I saw a shadow, I just assumed it was a shadow of something on top of the wardrobes, but when I studied it closer, the shadow suddenly jolted back, as if it had seen my looking at it. This creeped me the fuck out and I actually got up and looked above (Pathetic, I know) to see if there was anything there. My first and only experience with the 'paranormal'.	0
Latin/Cuban-Americans of reddit, how does the news of Fidel Castro's death impact you?	I went to a concert last night with my cuban friend and mid-song he started jumping from joy because his mom sent him the text that Castro died, saying that this was huge news for him	As a Cuban-American in Texas, me and my family are pretty distraught. He represented modern Cuba to everybody. It's a damn shame Castro's gone.	1
What qualities of a person make them more likeable immediately?	If they are Japanese. If they are swearing a kimono or school girl outfit. It they have large bobs. If they are not a man. I like Japanese or attractive females in school girls uniform or kimonos... Please don't judge me 😫😫😫😒😒	My favorite aunt was a winker. If you were in a group of people she'd make a joke and then wink at you, as if she'd told the joke just for you. This meant something to me because I was an army brat and hardly ever saw extended family. So the handful of times I saw Aunt Jean, those little winks always made me feel like I was really part of her family and not just some kid who visited at Christmas every couple of years. Aunt Jean's bawdy jokes and happy little winks were my favorite part of the holidays. Because of her, I feel an immediate affection/appreciation for anyone who tells a joke in a group and then gives me a little wink.	0
[Serious] What is an apocalyptic event that could realistically happen at any moment?	Things from space are your best bet: Meteors, Comets or even a Rogue Planet could hit the Earth with little-to-no warning. While we've tried to find all possible such objects we certainly haven't. The meteor over Chelyabinsk should've been a wakeup call that there are still some pretty big rocks we haven't seen at all. Other possibilities from space include Z-Class solar flares and Gamma Ray bursts.	Not world ending but an earthquake under New York City is a distinct possibility and they didn't exactly build all those skyscrapers with earthquakes in mind...	1
[Serious] Straight guys who've been with Transgender girls, what were your experiences like?	Throwaway here. I've been with a few MTF transgendered girls. I'll never do it again. Hear me out. I realize now, to me it's just a fetish, and that's how I looked at it. It's a cute chick with a dick, a fantasy to me. I wasn't thinking about the real person with feelings and desire to be the gender they really want to be. A person doesn't want to be seeked out, and have someone sleeping with them, only because it satisfies a fetish. Most people want to sleep with someone because they're wanted or horny. Not to objectified and viewed as a sexual fetishized "thing". Sorry if that wasn't the answer you wanted.	I had fun sucking her cock. It was kind of an excuse to try it out without feeling, I dunno, too gay about it. That said, it was ultimately unfulfilling, since she didn't have a pussy to fuck, wasn't into anal, and I don't cum from oral.	1
Reddit, how did you almost die?	I was travelling in my first vehicle, blindly thinking it was the safest place in the world. One day the pressure around me just suddenly went berserk and I lost control. I entered a darkened tunnel and felt this immense push from behind. All I could do was try to keep heading towarss the light at the end of the tunnel (literally in this case) Once I got out some bitch smacked my ass and put a clamp on my umbilical cord. I was a new person after this experience.	Harnessed on to the top of a 100' ski lift tower, painting away and minding my own business, and then wasps. Lots of 'em.	0
Where is the most depressing place you've ever visited and why?	People will say visits to old concentration camps and shit but honestly for me it's Cleveland. I was there for six hours a few years ago. What a miserable place	The home of a person whom had just died. Working in the Fire/EMS field and doing 30 minutes of CPR only to have the patient stay asystole the entire time is crushing, especially when you can hear the family sobbing in the next room.	0
What is positive and negative about your job that no one considers while applying for it?	Social media for a major sports broadcaster. Pro: Get to attend a lot of cool live sporting events and be right on the sidelines. Con: Your job follows you wherever you go, 24/7, because social media never stops. Also have to consistently read through some dishearteningly idiotic post comments on a daily basis. Edit: Spelling	Positive. My boss & co workers are really nice. Negative. It can get real disorganized, real quick - making it stressful and a bit of a shit show.	1
Thrift store workers, what's the weirdest things people have donated?	There was a bong in a box of donations. The little old ladies who run the thrift shop wouldn't touch it and wanted to call the police to come get it.	someone donated in a bag of baby clothes a small bag of baby sized dildos..... that’s when i knew i had to quit that job.	1
Lawyers of Reddit, what is the most frivolous/dumbest cases you've had to fight for or against?	Not me, but my friend's father is a lawyer, and he said a guy called and said he wanted to sue McDonald's because he thought he heard an employee calling him fat. This was during the morning of 9/11 while it was happening.	I worked for a divorce lawyer for a decade. In the midst of one divorce, the wife (who we represented) wanted us to fight for her to keep a set of commemorative shot glasses that her husband had gotten for a job well done on a project. Her reasoning was that she had advised him from home during that project and he wouldn't have gotten them if it wasn't for her help. No amount of "this isn't right" and "you are wasting time and money" would change her mind. The husband gave her the glasses rather than spend a grand with the back and forth and a hearing. She spent a few hundred though.	0
iPad just stolen, location of my iPad found using where's my iPad app. I know where it is. What should I do?	Go to where the GPS says they are, knock on the door, and when they open, do one of two things: 1) If they have hoodies on, shoot them. 2) If they do not have hoodies on, reason with them and politely ask for your stuff back, then if they refuse, call the cops/shoot them.	Good news, two mates rocked up to the house and knocked on the door (it's now 1am). A 50 something guy answers, they explain what happened and the guy calls his son to find out what he's been up to. Turns out his sons been up to no good tonight and the dads invited my two mates in to wait until the boy and his mates get home. Those boys are in trouble, break and enter and theft. They didn't count on technology tracking them down. Special thanks to the police service for their totally inaccurate advice and providing no assistance whatsoever	0
Mcdonalds workers, how do you feel about all day breakfast?	I fucking hate the shit. The problem with is I work at is not insanely busy 24/7 (we clear about 130k a month) and when some fuckbag comes in at 11:45 pm and orders 10 egg mcmuffins he makes me want to shove a spatula up his ass because theyre an eternal bitch to make since the muffin toaster thing takes a muffin and doesnt give it back half the time and we can only make 4 eggs at a time its just a bitch. You can guarantee yourself i will personally prohibit anyone in the kitchen to give you free bacon or whatever because mcmuffins suck and you suck too!	If McD's was smart (assuming that the all day bfast is successful, which I think it will be), they will start making a breakfast burger or add that option. $0.99 to add an egg to your Qpounder? Hell yes.	0
What are the most interesting domino effects in history?	From Wikipedia, this is probably my favorite 'That escalated quickly': "In 80 AD, Flavius Josephus recorded the first known incident of mooning. Josephus recorded that in the procuratorship of Ventidius Cumanus (48-52 AD), at around the beginning of the First Roman-Jewish War, a soldier in the Roman Army mooned Jewish pilgrims at the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem who had gathered for Passover, and "spake such words as you might expect upon such a posture" causing a riot in which youths threw stones at the soldiers, who then called in reinforcements—the pilgrims panicked, and the ensuing stampede resulted in the death of ten thousand Jews."	Jesus not paying his Roman mandated religion tax. Remember the Roman's didnt care what religion you followed as long as you paid your religion tax. The entire faith is built on the foundation of a guy fleeing the IRS of his time.	1
Gay Redditors who have ever fallen in love with a straight person: what happened?	it never comes to anything. ever. at best they let you give them head, only when they are drunk. then resent it. forget about it.	Married him. I'm one of two guys he's been with. He was exclusively straight before me and now would only sleep with another guy if it's part of a threesome with me.	1
Redditors, what is your favorite behind the scenes movie fact?	Jason was nicer than the director of one of the Friday the 13th films. One of them involved one of the actresses being submerged in the lake. It was the middle of winter, and the director refused to let the actress come out between takes, despite her begging him to let her out because she was freezing. The actor playing Jason eventually stood up for her, saying he would quit if she wasn't allowed to get out, and the director finally relented.	Leonardo DiCaprio's scene in Django Unchained at the dinner, where he cuts open his palm by breaking a glass in bare hands, is completely real and unscripted and decided to leave it in the movie anyways because he's too good of an actor and didn't stop for an instant.	1
Redditors who were the "smart kid" during school, how did your lives turn out?	Uh. I fucked my exams completley. Retook them, now at one of the best universities in the world and doing amazingly because not only was I the smart kid at school like everyone else hear. I had to learn to wrok. Source: LIke most other redditors I have a very high Iq and totally think everything through completely rationally.	He's in the Illinois House of Representatives at age 28. Man, he was fucking weird too. Always wore a suit to high school and carried around a briefcase. I guess it all worked out for him.	0
Which rides and attractions would a Nintendo theme park have?	There would only be 3 rides, and they'd be "updated" once a year by repainting and sticking googly eyes on the cars. Fanboys would still buy millions of tickets annually.	Rainbow Road Mario Kart go kart racing track. Except you won't fall to your death if you go off the road...that would not sit well with parents.	0
Redditors who declined marriage proposals...why did you decline?	She didn't want to raise a family in the church. Edit: Downvotes? Really? Edit2: Thanks to the folks who act like people.	He was convinced that I was going to be the next 'Virgin Mary'....as in literally birth Jesus for his Second Coming. He felt we needed to get married to make this happen. (He also thought he was the next 'Joseph.') I'm not religious at all, so this was a dealbreaker. Also, I thought he was just pretty nuts in general.	0
If your job had an Order 66....what would you have to do?	Marine corps, hopefully kill all the politicians so we can start from scratch. Hopefully NOT so I accidentally help start a brutal dictatorship.	I work in a room that has a "kill switch". It's a button, that when pressed, will shut the system for the entire building down. It's never been pressed where I work but at least once a year we get a company wide email explaining the procedures for pressing the button. It's usually pressed accidentally due to ignorance but I know at least one time it was pressed by someone who quit, on their way out.	0
When i was 9, I once stuck a cheeseburger down my pants to trick my mother. What was your biggest "What was I thinking?!" moment as a child?	I think I was around 7 or 8. But my friend Christian and I coloured each others penis' green with felt tip pen at his house. I have no idea what that was about. His mum found us. We sort of stopped hanging out after that. Mums eh? True.	I was 10 when this happened so keep that in mind while reading how obscure this gets. My parents had just taken me to Ringling Brothers circus the night before and I was completely captivated by the man who stuck his head inside and alligators mouth. So with my new veiw on animal taming/mastery I went behind my house into the neighborhood alley and approached my neighbor's easily pissed off rotweiler and proceeded to- first time I ever saw real live boobs. I'd say totally worth it.	1
What's the most unlikely thing you've ever guessed at random?	This was about ten years ago. I found a skinhead racist forum. I went in to the administrator page and guessed the password to be "shit". BINGO! I changed the background color to pink and I renamed the page "The Love Room"	All the plot twists in the movie Splice. Save yourself if you haven't watched it. I attribute my powers to being incredibly high at the time. Also one time in 7th grade, my history teacher put a picture of some random old guy on the board and asked us who it was. I don't know how I knew it, but I raised my hand and guessed Galileo and I was right. There really was no context for me to try and guess it correctly either. One of my proudest intellectual moments in middle school.	1
If inanimate objects could talk, which object would complain the most?	Hawaiian Pizza, you'd be created and excited to full your customers desires. Patiently you wait as pizza after pizza is consumed and that one weird guy is having a nibble of one of your slices. suddenly you are the last one and oh wait! someones coming! they will eat you. You can make your creators proud. until you're at the bottom of the bin, forgotten and wondering why ANYONE EVER ORDERS BLOODY HAWAIIAN. I'M TALKING TO YOU PAUL, NO ONE LIKES IT	My age old laptop/notebook. God, that son of a bitch would complain about anything. I seriously cannot spend an hour on that thing without it freezing on me at least a couple of times. "Oh noo don't open spotify AND office, I already opened chrome today, ugh, I'm tired..." Edit: spelling	0
When did you realize that the Coronavirus is a big deal?	At first I slowly began to realize it until I found out the CDC lied on their report. About 80 percent of supposed "corona deaths" were from other causes. They are reported as corona deaths because hospitals get money for it. Not to mention, when thousands of protesters gathered for the BLM movement, nobody said anything about them spreading the virus. And yet we can't gather in churches because we'll spread it? The hypocrisy is unbelievable. Stop letting the media manipulate you and live your life. Be respectful to those who would rather keep their distance, follow common-sense safety measures, and enjoy yourself.	When China completely shutdown a metro area of 30 million in a desperate attempt to contain it. So pretty much early to mid January.	0
What is the worst thing a best friend has ever done to you?	I showed my best child-hood friend where I kept my money stash, 'cause if you're a kid & you have money, how cool is that?! But while she was over, she excused herself from whatever silly activities we were up to at the time so that she could raid my piggy bank & steal the only $5 I had. I'll never forgive her for that. $5 means a buttload to a kid.	I once had a best friend go nuts on me. I come home from dinner with my girlfriend and I find a computer that I had loaned him with an strange note that it was a "gift." He comes by later with my roommate and starts freaking out saying I was stealing his girlfriend or some such shit. My gf and I look at each other in disbelief. We sorta lost touch after that.	1
How many of you actually think of yourself as "hot"?	FWIW, It's been my personal experience that those who think they're "hot" tend to be too narcissistic and egotistical to be enjoyable company. "Hot" is also subjective as hell. I may think someone is hot while someone else thinks they're rather 'meh'. I know historically, my idea of very attractive ("hot") is atypical.	I feel hot.. until I see a photo of myself and then realize I must be delusional or something. Why does that happen!? The person is the mirror is an entirely different creature from the person in front of a camera lens. Not fair.	0
What is "common knowledge" that's actually completely false?	That bombs create big flaming bursts of fire. Those are gasoline explosions that look good on camera, so they're used in movies. Most explosions are just concussive force and shrapnel.	If you put something electrical into the bathtub while you're in it, you'll get shocked or/and die. In reality nothing would happen except breaking the thing and maybe over-current protection would trigger and turn off the phase you used. You can literally put two cables straight from your wall power outlet into the bathtub and even have none protections like over-current, short-circuit or RCD and you wouldn't feel a thing, only when you put e.g. your finger between the wires, you'd feel the current flowing between them but it would be far from shocking. Nevertheless, don't try it.	1
What is the biggest waste of money that people regularly buy?	Those damn cleansers for your body that remove "toxins" You have one already. It's called your liver and kidneys. If you want to stop feeling like shit, eat better and exercise.	What people buy with their money is their own business. (Most people) worked hard for it so they can buy whatever they want	1
What do you feel is the biggest misconception other people have about you?	(I am a guy & an atheist) I have really good emotion resistances so i can control them, the hardest part is to explain that i also have feelings...	Apparently, whenever I'm not around, my coworkers make jokes about me being a grumpy bastard. But I'm not grumpy at all. I just hate them and want them to die.	0
Those that've noped the fuck out of a relationship, what was your "they are probably crazy" red flag moment?	"My ex started a rumor at my college that I'm pregnant. Might as well just get knocked up since everyone already thinks I am." Then she stared at me expectantly. She wasn't joking.	I had an SO, who I actually really liked, who sent me multi-page love letters. Sounds kind of charming, but it was so clingy, it was creepy. I prefer just speaking to one another. Simple and direct.	1
I gave myself a black eye trying to open a ketchup packet. What's the dumbest injury you've ever inflicted on yourself?	chipped a tooth, separated my shoulder, and bursitis in my shoulder that turned septic requiring surgery. all from when i hit myself in the face wii bowling.	I wanted to do a frontflip, from other places then the trampoline. So drunk in the middel of the night I jump up on a bench and when i jumped of the bench i found out that i did not take off well enough so instead of a frontflip i did a faceplant and got a black eye as you did :) Could have been the best youtube video, so said it was not filmed -.-	1
(NSFW) Prison guards of Reddit, what's the most disturbing thing you've dealt with?	I knew a prison guard at Winson Green in Birmingham and he said the most disturbing thing about Fred West was how jovial he was. The officers kept forgetting and laughing at his jokes and stuff and then thinking, "Erm this guy sexually tortured his own daughter and buried her in concrete"	In the deep South about 15 years ago, we had a very weird prisoner in our small facility. Huge black guy who everyone was afraid of, until you talked with him, the guy couldn't kill a fly. One day, I shit you not, he brought a stomped on mouse back to life. Long story short, he cured my infertility and my wife thanked him with cornbread or something He also got the electric chair	1
Dear Reddit, what is your weirdest dream/nightmare you've ever had?	I dreamt I was a reporter chasing a story on the AIDS virus. I was alone on some deserted boardwalk, when a woman suddenly approached me and said “here’s your story!” and tried stabbing me with a syringe. We fought and struggled and I woke up punching my wall in a cold sweat.	When I was younger, I had a dream a witch was in my toilet in the night and I asked her “go back to sleeeeep!” And she told me no then she spun a wheel and I woke up. o_o	1
What moment in a television show made you become emotionally attached to it?	Jesse throwing that ridiculously sad party in Breaking Bad. No one cares about his shit, his home, or even him, but he wants to have all this energy and people around so he doesn't feel so lonely. Poor Jesse.	The end of season 4 for Dexter. SPOILER ALERT: when Rita got killed I got so into it. But then it started going downhill.	1
What sexual thing would you thoroughly recommend?	My lady friend goes insane whenever I tell her to lay still in bed and let me massage her with some cream or whatever similar. Whenever she gets frisky I swat her hands or hold her still, upping the tone of the massage slowly, teasing her but without penetrating her in any way. That until she just loses her shit and jumps me like a rabid monkey. I think that nothing gets a woman horny faster than not letting her do what she wants with you	Slapping. Like when he gets rough, slap his face hard enough that it stings. I'm not even joking, this has led to the best sexual experiences of my life every time, and I have absolutely never had a man get upset over it. It's always turned them on to the furthest degree and makes them truly manhandle you. I'm sure some guys may take issue though.	1
I blacked out last night, what is the worst thing you've had to been told the morning after?	Asked my girlfriend "who that sexy bitch is" about one of her friends, then kept leering at her, then I got kicked out of some pub for smashing glasses. On the way home, got into an argument with strangers, then strangled my girlfriend. She lived!	I carried a single couch about two miles back to my apartment because it was so damn comfortable. My roommate told me I would stop and sit in it whenever a cop would drive by on my walk back, even on campus	0
What can you not believe you had to tell someone?	An older lady asked me once if I happened to come across her friend when I was in Africa...I just answered, "No, uh, Africa's pretty big..."	I actually had to tell me ex I wasn't taking her out in public until she changed out of her pjs. That's when I realized I'm better than her entire family and it wouldn't work. Edit: I may be arrogant, but if you wear pjs in public you should feel embarrassed.	1
What was your wittiest comeback that you're still proud of?	Stranger : you suck Me: No, you do. I’m a simple minded human but I simply deflect the burn and redirect it back to them. Works on almost anything.	Working at a pizza shop, troublesome customer tries to stack coupons that clearly state "One coupon per purchase". After being refused by everyone in the restaurant including the owner, he goes on a tirade saying that the District Attorney is his cousin, and was threateneing a lawsuit (lol). As he was heading for the door, he said "You can't afford to mess with me!" I shouted after him, "You can't afford a large pizza!"	0
What's the biggest lie taught in schools?	Middle school : when you get to high school you won't be able to turn in work late High school : your college professors definite won't accept anything past the deadline Both turned out to be bullshit in my experience	Sex is for marriage. If you do it before then, you'll burn in hell. Yeah, Catholic schools need to change that policy. Nobody gives a shit what the Vatican says about sexuality anymore. And restricting access to birth control just creates a whole slew of problems, including more abortions. IDK, but I'm pretty sure the Church would like to decrease abortion rates...	1
Reddit, what is your best "Oh God please stop laughing" story?	I have a horrible trait where I can't keep a straight face. I was working tier 1 IT, not much going on, a coworker tells a joke, I start laughing hard. Mid laugh, the phone rings, finish my chuckle, get my professional face on, answer the phone. Silence for like .8 seconds, then I just burst out laughing on the phone. The guy on the other end, calling for computer issues, hears me just laughing, and for no reason just starts laughing with me. This went on for way too long, and I kept chuckling throughout the call.	2 stories for ye. At my grandmothers funeral mass, the alter boys kept laughing. cheeky little fuckers had no respect for the dead. I am atheist but I still respect the dead and whatnot. Afterwards they spat on my mams car. Their parents arrived before I could get to the, would have tried, at least, to fuck them up. Then, I at a funeral of my grandp-uncle, I farted, of course, like a 10 year old would, and the whole funeral smelled so bad, this is outside btw, as they were laying the coffin down.	1
Chefs of reddit, I need your advice! I lost a bet and I have to eat a pair of socks. How should I prepare my meal?	Get one of those novelty edible socks made of chocolate, stare your friend in the eye and slowly munch that fucker	It sucks that you must eat a sock, For meals I considered this is worst then the rest, Lamb brains, liver and fish eggs I do certainly detest, But then I remember socks boiled in orange syrup zest, The texture was rough like eating a scale salad, Favors I ate very rarely I have ever before encounted, But consider this for who fate is abound, Whether tasty, bland or disgusting another meal is just around.	1
Should Anti-Vaxxers be Charged with Child Neglect? If Yes, What are the Conditions/Exceptions?	Neglecting to appropriately monitor and secure the health of a child, in any case, is neglect. But this doesn't even take into account the dangers posed to people who cannot get vaccinated when a parent refuses to do so with a child that is perfectly capable of being vaccinated. Herd immunity is a necessity for some who do not have the ability to be vaccinated due to health concerns, economic conditions, location, etc. Because of this, if refusing to vaccinate your child, despite it being perfectly feasible, is not neglect, it is very close. But whether or not it should legally be classified as such is a little more complex than a simple yes/no answer. The needs of the child and conditions of the family should be considered before labelling all unvaccinated children as neglected.	Yes. They get two warnings, then the children are taken by CPS and a fine is issued. If they pass a test to determine whether they will comply with the law or not they can have the kids back. If they get the 2nd warning again it's prison time and observed visits until the children are 18. All vaccinations are free for persons under 18. They are playing with their kids life, it'd be like if I just dangled my kid over an aligator pond each day and then wondered why they got eaten.	1
[Serious] People who talk incessantly (you know who you are.) Why? Why must you fill the air with words, constantly?	There are some people who probably think I never shut up. What they don't know is that I only ever talk to them. I don't have many friends, and I spend most of my time alone, so when I do end up hanging out with people, I have all this pent up conversational energy and I just can't stop. Basically, I talk the same amount as a normal person, but I do it all in about one day a month.	The talker's brain is "generating original, creative thoughts" much more actively than the other sources in the room (let's be honest about how inactive most peoples brains are) to the point where it's dominant. Combine this with an extravert or possibly insecurity (need for attention) and you've got a verbal thinker on your hands.	1
Reddit, what was your five minutes of fame?	A woman attempted to steal me from the hospital the day after I was born, she was busted trying to leave with me. It was ALL over the news for weeks. I have cassette tapes from 3 different news stations featuring the story and interviews with my mom. No one remembers now but it was quite the story 23 years ago. I recently gave birth in the same hospital. They have crazy security now. They took out the nursery and the entire maternity ward is on lockdown 24/7 and nurses follow all these strict guidelines.	So, here I am - 11th grade Target of bullying No big deal, they can suck it Gym class Hockey players, baseball players Fucking jocks, won't leave me alone Indoor wiffle ball time, left field Quick grounder straight to me, three on base, one out Rear back and *whoosh* - straight to home Third base didn't make it in time Every baseball player, "That was unfair! You have to throw it to [insert base here] first!" Demoralized and pissed, the next guy swings wild and hits a high one Easily caught That's right you team of neanderthal jocks, the bullied just beat you at your own game Fuckers The year after that, 12th grade, I nearly broke the school bullies nose. It wasn't a bad couple years overall. Not internet celebrity or anything, but damn if it didn't feel good.	1
If you were a dictator what would you outlaw?	Popup ads that opens in another window, blasting at full volume, telling you how you can work from home and make 10k a week	(Old people = 70+) - Old people may not access supermarkets after 4PM, you have all day, why bother us all with your overall slowness and obliviousness to all surroundings. - Old people may not drive cars, public transport is free for old people, use it. - People hogging the fast lane of the highway will be given a free pass for public transportation, driver's licence will be burned. - Uploading or sending pictures via social media, WhatsApp etc is no longer possible between 00:00 - 07:00. - Social Media is not accessible to anyone below 18. Doing you a favour kid. - YouTube adverts will be banned - Religion will be banned - No cars allowed on Sunday to celebrate the day of empty roads for bikers. (As in motorbikes, push bikes/mountain bikes also banned on Sunday) Basically all things that annoy me will be banned.	1
Women of Reddit...what's your man's most lame move that he uses to let you know he's in the "mood"?	he takes his shirt off casually, kinda looks at me with his signature "you know you want it" eyes-half-shut, snarky little glance, pretends to ignore me for a few seconds and i end up jumping him. every. goddamn. time. i swear to god, he's the chick in this relationship (i'm taking a break from my policy of non-heterocisnormativity for this post).	My husband grabs his boner, pulls it down and let it slap his stomach asking me if I wanna climb on his party pole. Or, if he's feeling extra creative he tries to balance things on it. I'm sure he finds some of my moves equally lame.	0
Vegans and vegetarians of reddit, what made you decide to adopt your dietary choice?	When I was 21 I made a $2 bet with a friend that I would not eat meat for the rest of my life I'm now 57, and so far I'm winning.	Vegetarian, trying for Vegan (Chocolate and Cheese are holding me back) Stopped eating meat because I couldn't stand the thought that I was eating something that used to be alive. Started feeling sick after eating meat. Decided I didn't need it, and cut it out of my diet	1
Those who work in insurance claims, what's your best "you've got to be kidding me" story?	A guy who had his auto policy with us for years decided to take out an accident policy on himself. Not to long after, he died by falling off a train and breaking his neck. Death on a train causes his policy to pay out double. It looked air tight but it didn't sit right with me. I spoke to some passengers on the train and did some digging on his young wife and, long story short, the wife conspired with my best salesman to kill the husband and collect the policy. They either ended up shooting each other or jumping off a ship and drowning to escape justice.	Worked in IT at an insurance company. Claim that made the rounds was a homeowners policy where a guest filed a claim against the homeowners policy because she caught gonorrhea from his sex toys. Claim was denied.	0
What job do most people not realize they could get that pays well?	Any woman with a cursory knowledge of computers and electronics can probably land a technician job. I have a girlfriend who was a little lacking in the fundamentals but had a little background fixing computers and doing basic preventative maintenance. She did an interview and as she put it "bombed". She couldn't answer half the questions but got a few. They offered her a $70k a year job. She asked why and it was because the company only had 1 woman in the country doing the job. They said they would help her get caught up and even if it didn't work out they would "find a place for her". I work as an engineer and this is not the first person I have heard the same story from.	Crane operator. Dudes get paid a ton and spend most days chillin in a pilot seat pulling levers. Source- currently operating a crane	0
Forever Aloners: If you think you're reasonably attractive, yet still forever alone, why do you think that is?	I'm extremely shy. It's near impossible for me to start a conversation with someone I don't know, and even harder to carry a conversation. I tend to just trip over my words and look like a complete idiot.	I'm nice and I respect women, so I get stepped all over. Maybe it's because I'm not forward enough, but if I go to parties the girls always end up talking to the big tough guy that just wants to get with them.	1
People who got cheated on, how did you find out?	It's almost unbelievable. I had a work meeting at a hotel that coworkers were staying at. I looked out the window and saw her pull up, and walk in with some guy. End of the meeting, saw her walk out with him, and he kissed her and grabbed her ass. Was useless that day.	She texted me that she was with her friend Heather .......which was a lie since Heather was right next to me in the bed	1
What is something that 90% of people don't seem to understand?	When you keep adding new tasks, but you aren't adding new pay, at some point people are going to start really half-assing it.	Strict gun control saves lives. It's as simple as that. People who argue against gun control are basically telling you they don't care about saving people's lives.	1
Baby sitters of redditors what is funniest/NSFW/scariest incident that happened when you baby sit?	Kid had a seizure. I thought he was throwing a tantrum. I said "FINE, YOU CAN HAVE A COOKIE. BUT ONLY ONE!" Then his sister came and told me what was going on. Yeah that wasn't fun. First time babysitting and his 12 year old sister has to take the ropes and handle her brother having a seizure. Apparently they weren't all that rare, and were pretty mild, but it sure threw me for a loop, especially since I hadn't been informed of this kids epilepsy.	I love all these posts where people want to feed their kinks. Furries of reddit, what's the craziest thing that ever happened to you? One-armed midgets of reddit... Incontinent cheerleaders of reddit... I love you OP, but take your babysitter fetish elsewhere, lol.	1
How many people would be interested in a subreddit full of tabled IAMAs?	I'm a fan of your tables and relentlessly downvote your naysayers, I would love it if you did this for all the reasons you specified and more.	YES. It would be awesome, and make it so much easier to search old AMAs since we have so many now.	0
Why can't I stand the sound of my own voice when it's recorded?	it's not the sound of your voice you hate. you hate what it is saying and who is saying it.	Whenever I hear my own voice recorded my first thought is always "How is it possible that I have friends with such a terrible annoying voice."	0
What is the creepiest thing a stranger has ever said to you?	Sometimes I think my reputation precedes me, and I hear little things I say. I look at them for a second, and say: "Naaaaaaah."	I worked at a cafe' years ago and a customer came in one day, looked me dead in the eye, and said "do you know who your biological mother is?" (I don't, I was adopted at birth) I told her that, and she got very red in the face. She said I was the spitting image of someone she went to high school with who gave a child up for adoption around the time I was born, and she would try to bring me a yearbook with the woman's picture. She ordered her coffee, left, and I never saw her again. Freaks me out to this day.	0
One Halloween, I complimented an overweight co-worker on her pumpkin costume. It was a carrot costume. Reddit, when have you said/done something that you meant to be nice but made you look like a terrible person?	How are fat people getting offended? THEY KNOW THEY ARE FAT. It's not like they woke up one day at plus 300 pounds. It takes a LOT of work to get that heavy, holy shit I see them rage in the ER all the time over food and being told they need to lose weight of they will die soon.	Once I worked in a pizza place, had to walk through the restaurant to get to the delivery car. On my way through I saw two people I know, never spoken to them but we were part of the same crowd. As I walked past I planned on saying "gidday" (I'm from New Zealand) as I said it my brain decide to throw a spanner in the works and let me know without warning that saying "hey" would be a better option. So basically I walk past them, look right in there faces, say "Gay!" at them and waltz out the place.	0
[Serious] Reddit, what are your thoughts/opinions on genetically engineering humans?	I don't like the thought of it (as it's basically reversing your evolution) but I think it will eventually be necessary as medicine will weaken our species without this.	It'll be exclusive to the rich. You'll end up with the genetically superior upper class which is small. Shit will go downhill from there.	0
What happened to your bully?	he still lives with me. follows me everywhere i go. he always whispers in my ear that i am not good enough.	Back in middle school, there was one bully who went after me specifically. Among all sorts of standard bully behavior, he really loved gay slurs (I'm not gay, but I very much doubt he cared). I looked him up on Facebook a few years back. He's now happily married to a man, and works at a graphic design company that had just done a bunch of work for an LGBT organization. It makes a lot of his former behavior make sense, and I'm glad he's turned his life around. :)	0
Reddit, throughout your education what made your worst teacher the worst?	Kindergarten teacher She didn't teach me how to read. I was *very* advanced in math and as a result was told to sit apart from the other kids while they were trying to solve problems because I had a really bad habit of blurting out the answer. She assumed I was advanced in other subjects as well I guess, because she didn't teach me how to read. My mom taught me. When I was 7. Using Go Dog Go. Took to it quickly though, I finished Lord of the Rings when I was 10.	5th grade teacher changed my test scores when I tested for placement in Middle School. I got placed in remedial classes (was usually in the higher classes) before I got retested and got placed in my normal classes. She got caught years later when it was found out that she had changed many students grades whom she personally didn't think belonged in those higher courses.	0
What is the most fucked up way you have gotten back at somebody?	There was a kid in junior high that always used to make fun of me because I was a bit chubby back then, one day I finally snapped when he asked me "Swangz why are you so fat?" I responded with "I don't know why did your brother kill himself?" Never felt worse in my life.	I posted about this in another AskReddit. In Highschool I had taken control of the schools network and teachers used Excel sheets for class grades. They would basically put in each homework assignment/test scores into the sheet, then give the student back the original work, which no one ever kept. Well, after taking domain admin access on their network, I could see every excel sheet and change them. People I liked instantly got better grades, and people that pissed me off for one reason or another mysteriously ended up failing and had summer school. Don't remember a specific instance, but I'm sure the people effected would remember it!	1
[Serious] What was your experience when you were mugged?	Attacked at ATM, by black man who was "tired of seeing white people" Police did nothing with description of vehicle and tag number, had left my pistol in the car, they did tell me they would have charged me with murder if I had shot the guy. Got the impression they are not in my side.	I actually have a bad story turned into a good story. I was probably 7 years old and walking around Bradleys with my mom's friend who was babysitting me. I thought it was weird that my mom's friend always talked to me weird and touched me weird. She put me into the center of one of the clothing racks and started to touch me inappropriately. At the time I didn't know what was happening. From behind a man came up and asked for her money and to not make a scene. Being the idiot she was she let out a scream and the man ran out of the store. Afterwards they watch the security footage. There I am getting molested in the middle of a clothing store. Tldr: Mugger stopped me from getting molested. Mother's friend got in a lot of trouble.	0
[Serious] Ex-cons of Reddit, what advice would you give people going to prison for the first time that people who haven't been might not be aware of?	Bring a few packs of smokes in your butt and don't tell anyone until you're on your range. You'll have a very easy first few days, and avoid packet thieves	I did 8 months in the county justice center. 1) Not everyone is out to get you, relax. 2) Dont relax too much, people will take advantage of you. 3) Learn if you can. I learned Spanish, started learning Russian, a little bit of a trade skill, and enhanced my vocabulary while in. 4) Stay fairly low key (but not a hermit), no one likes too much of a social butterfly.	0
What took you an embarassingly long time to realise?	That the cow my family had when I was about seven didn't go to live on another farm. I was telling the story my freshman year of college when I realized what actually happened.	That blue balls is actual just a clever way for guys to complain that they didn't get to finish. Realized it 2 weeks ago when arguing about it with my boyfriend. I was mid sentence and then I blurted out the realization. He thought it was hilarious. I'm 25. Also, on family guy, it took forever but Trisha Takanowa... Talk-a-now-a... She's a reporter.	1
Swallow and hold to make shaving around your Adam's Apple a breeze. What man-tips can you bestow upon reddit?	Don't just stare at her if you like her. If you are not feeling courageous enough to talk to her today, gently smile as in greeting if your eyes meet.	Buy her the easy squeeze condiment bottles... she will save tons of time from not having to wash dozens of knives while she's making you sandwiches.	1
Attractive people of Reddit, when did you realize you were "hot"? What are the pros and cons?	When I went to an extremely small elementary school/high school, so I knew my entire grade from the time we were 5, and no one seemed to be interested in me, I'd about given up. When I went to college, though, and started going out/to parties... holy crap. All these things started happening I didn't know how to handle. You want to buy me a drink? Dance? But I-I'm fugly! What?! Pros: Attention Cons: Attention	I thought I might have been when I was able to bed OPs mom, but it turns out it was just because I bought her a mcdouble..	1
Reddit, what's your party trick?	I can listen to a song on YouTubes or the radio and then replay it on piano pretty accurately. Perfect pitch ftw.	My best party trick involves ignoring all the people while I eat food and pet whatever animals the host owns.	0
HELP: My brother was assaulted which resulted in a broken jaw, had it wired shut, and now that he needs the wires removed, the hospital is telling us his surgery needs to be paid in full before he may have it. What do we do?	If he was in the military, sorry to say you're SOL. My friend's husband was literally gutted (yes, as in had his stomach cut open by a long bladed knife) by an active duty seal on leave when he was working as a bartender. The situation was purged from civilian LE records and it was all handled by military courts and my friend and her husband weren't allowed to know the outcome or pursue any charges against the Seal.	I may be way off here, but if he's in the military he was likely turned over to the MPs and thus your paper trail problem. Pursue that angle and see where it gets you.	0
If I was dropped into ancient Egypt as a Pharaoh, what is one book that would help me get technology up to the 21st century as fast as possible and how could I implement it into society?	I love how most people are unaware that Ancient Egyptian society was very technologically advanced. They had electricity, telescopes and calculators. They knew more about the universe then all of us common man.	"The Way Things Work" by David Macaulay. They'd be a little confused by the excessive useof mammoths but otherwise its has a great illustrated explanation of every important technology you might want.	0
What is the most obscure fact that you've memorized?	Oh man, I have the perfect one for this! The world record for the fastest time to consume 1 lb. of eels is 13 seconds.	I have the NATO alphabet memorized. If people upvote this enough (let's say 50 upvotes) I will post a video of me reciting it blindfolded.	1
Whats the rudest/meanest thing a teacher has every done to you?	Holds up newspaper in front of entire class when i'm not there, finds the page about a local 15-year old being busted with weed and goes on about it for some time, heavily implying that i was the one busted. She hated my guts, and i still want to fuck her torso with a chainshaw shotgun. This is just one episode, not remembering any more shit for you internet fuckers.	My friend was told by his 7th grade teacher that his autistic son could draw better than him. My friend replied, "At least I'll get better". My friend got suspended.	0
What are some racist jokes about white people?	I'm white as hell and I'm offended by literally 0% of these; in fact, most of em are pretty damn funny. So why do people of other races have to get so butthurt over it? And I wish more comedians would focus on racist jokes of other races as well. Only black people make jokes about white people..	An Englishman, a Welshman and a Pakistani man were sat in the waiting room of the maternity ward at the local hospital. A nurse comes out and says to the men "I'm sorry, but there's a been a mix-up and we don't know which baby belongs to which mother. Any chance one of you could come in and see if you can help?" The Englishman stands up and says that he'll help. He walks into the ward and, a couple of minutes later walks out with what is obviously a Pakistani baby. The Pakistani man stands up and shouts "What do you think you're doing?!" And the Englishman said "Look, one of those babies in there is Welsh, and I'm not taking any chances."	0
[Serious] Sociopaths of reddit, what made you realise that you are one? did you try to change anything?	I was diagnosed with ASPD, I have almost all the markers. I've always known I was different but I didn't have a word for it. I don't consider it a sickness, infact there are no drawbacks. I never tried to change but with that said I'm not being myself around other people. Social interactions are just a game that I happen to be very good at.	When my girlfriend was bawling her eyes out in front of me and I wasn't affected in the slightest. The only emotion I have is varying degrees of anger. I'm never not angry, I'm only less angry then other times. And I don't try to change it because there's nothing to change. I am who I am.	1
Waiters and waitresses of restaurants that offer crayons to children, what’s the weirdest thing you’ve seen a child draw?	I work as a waiter in Harvester. An 8-10 year old boy simply wrote 'mum is arsehole' on one of our drawing pads.	My kid at age 8 drew a person with an orange face and yellow hair. She labelled it President Trump and explained to our waitress that Trump was orange and looked like a giant Cheeto. The waitress asked to keep the picture :)	1
