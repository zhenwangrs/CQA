I burned my penis while trying to iron my shirt in the early morning. I am my own worst enemy... What are some of your worst self-inflicted injuries?	Naired my balls on a dare once. It was like the gay porn parody of Fight Club. "And this...is a chemical burn!"	Im sorry but Im still not seeing how at any point in the ironing process your penis would have gotten that close to the iron.	1
People of Reddit, are you aware of the YouTube channels who take screenshots of popular Reddit posts, put a text to speech voice over on them and get millions of views? If so, what are your opinions on them?	My roommate listens to them every day, and he will undoubtedly listen to this one when it is uploaded. He also conveniently goes by his first initial, so ill say hi, T! If you hear this, it’s your turn to take out the trash.	So here’s my rules on them: •They must include the OP’s name. •No text to speech. •They must bring something new to the table such as jokes or little skit type things done by YouTubers such as SorrowTV or Soothouse. •They have to do something other than Reddit videos. •They should leave a link in the description to either Reddit itself or whatever sub their video focuses on.	1
What's a YouTuber that you really like to watch?	Pewdiepie, I think you all know him. He’s just very funny and his videos ảe interesting. That’s what attract me	Ants Canada - This guy creates these beautiful biomes for his ant colonies and narrates their lives like it’s a documentary. TierZoo - Ranks animals in a video game like fashion CasuallyExplained -He just gets me	0
Atheist parents of reddit: How do you explain death to your children and how do you comfort them when they experience a death to somebody they know?	As the atheist parent of a 5 yr old girl, I have always been up front with her about death. My Aunt died when my daughter was 3, and explaining that has set the stage for all other deaths. I never spoke of heaven. I just explain that everyone dies, just as all plants and animals die. I tell her it is sad when people die, but we need to remember the good things. I think taking the fairy tales out of the equation has made it easier to cope with multiple losses of family members and friends for myself and my daughter. I don't tell her that god or heaven are NOT real, mind you... I just don't ever speak of them.	I'm not a parent *yet*, but I'd still tell them that people go to a better place when they die. Doesn't mean I need to whip out a bible and make my kids religious, but if they are young like the Sandy Hook kids it just makes more sense. Older children could handle a more realistic "nothing happens" when you die talk, but kids that age? Put your atheism aside and just tell them when they die they go to a better place. It's a little white lie, you can correct it when they are older, you don't have to make them religious, but you still don't have to tell them the straight up truth. They just won't handle it well.	1
People who quit their job to follow their dreams, how did it turn out for you?	Pretty shitty. I had a 6-figure salaried job going on, but then I had this dream. In it, I began stalking Nicole Kidman around, shooting spitballs at her until she turned around, and then I'd point to the guy standing next to me and pretend it was him. Then I was arrested and brought before Who Framed Roger Rabbit's Judge Doom, and he threw me into his "dip" and I melted. So I quit my job and started following my dream, but I could never get close enough to Nicole to hurl spitballs at her. So I had to settle for Will Smith's kid... Whatshisface. So, my dreams ended up not being practical at all.	I quit my job at taco bell to follow my dream of not working at taco bell. Sure enough, dreams do come true!	0
What three items are always in your refrigerator?	Milk, diet Dr K, ham and cheese, ketchup, coffee creamer, butter, yogurt, among others. (Yes I know that's more then three)	A jar of pepperoncinis I was given, half a stick of butter that tastes like fridge air, and what I assume is an unlabeled tube of crescent rolls. Possibly caulk, but probably crescent rolls.	0
When was the last time you were snooping, and found something you wish you hadn’t?	Yesterday. My room mate ditched out of state right before rent is due, so naturally I am curious how he left his room and what not. Got more than I bargained for. Room is a disaster, beer bottles and food all over, but the thing that got me most was his anal vibrator, and a huge pile of fuck wads. If I ever see him again, I may just go to prison.	Back when I was a kid I found a few joint roaches in my mother's night stand drawer. Actually, I don't regret that decision at all. Edited for grammar.	1
I know somebody who broke up with her boyfriend because an online quiz said they weren't compatible. Reddit, what is the dumbest reason you have heard for a couple breaking up?	The funny thing is, if a girl ever told me we had to break up because an online quiz said we aren't compatible, *she'd be exactly right*.	A girl broke up with me because I was basically too smart for her. University degree (Masters) for me, Associates Degree for her. I didn't care, she was a blonde bimbo and I enjoyed it.	1
People who have shat all over the place in public restrooms ,and left it for workers to clean, what's your side of the story?	i get that its gross, but ask a plumber or a nurse about cleaning shit. so you had to clean a bathroom .. 1 time... nurse's are literally cleaning shit by the ton.. and plumbers... well .. we are talking old.. been in the pipes for a few weeks.. dripping in your mouth .. in a crawl space... where its 100f and 100% humidity .. i feel bad for the fast food people.. but c'mon there are people who put in 20+ years of hard daily shit fighting	Walking home from a bar. Really, really, REALLY needed to go. Stopped at a take-out greek place. Ducked immediately into the bathroom. Absolutely defiled the bowl. Reach out for toilet paper....none. Look in the bowl, realize there is no water in the bowl. Discover that that's because the toilet is not hooked up. At all. It's just sitting on the floor. Sacrifice a pair of underwear, and SPRINT out the door. Sorry, guys.	0
What is one skill you feel every 20-something year old should have/know?	How to find answers for themselves. With the Internet you should be able to find a little bit about everything.	A bit younger. in highschool I think people need to do two things. ONE be trained and educated on how to respond in any sort of emergency. not the details but the basics. not panicking. how to see the trouble basic response basic issues. IE how not to freak out and how to be somewhat useful. Second. every student needs to be water boarded. seriously water boarded until they seriously and honestly admit to something that is completely false. so that every citizen understand EXACTLY what torture is and will be far far less likely to tolerate their government "doing" it. for any reason.	1
How is it to have a SO? Did it improve your life or would you rather be single and alone again?	I didn't mind being single, but there is something fantastic about having someone I know I love to hang out with all the time, who's willing to teach me new things and who wants to have adventures. It's a constant shot of happiness, honestly.	At this point in my life it's a lot less work to have casual sex with people than to actually have to invest yourself into a "SO" type of relationship. Relationships aren't for everyone. Sex is.	1
Tour guides of reddit, what's the most idiotic question you'v ever been asked?	Geology museum: I was showing off some fossils, one of which was shrimp to a group of second graders. One little girl gets really wide eyed/amazed and asks in an impressed voice "Shrimp are real?" It was so adorable	When my foolish Neimoidian puppet asks if our invasion of Naboo is legal. As if I wouldn't make it so!	1
[SERIOUS] People who did not learn to read or write until you were an adult, what was it like living in such a literary heavy world? What was the adjustment like?	American living in China here, it is difficult. I have tried to learn Mandarin, but my 40yo brain does not retain anything. Meanwhile, my daughter that was 10 when we moved here 3 years ago is pretty much fluent to the extent that she can even read and write the characters. Sorry for the double post.	I love how OP lets his racism show by just assuming that all illiterate people are black and speak ebonics.	1
[Serious] Redditors who have completely ruined somebody's life (intentionally or by accident, whether they deserved it or not), what happened and why did you do it ?	This was in highschool. Overheard a guy talking to someone about selling him weed at lunch behind the science building. I snitched on him and his locker was searched and turned up weed. He was arrested and afterward they found a buffet of drugs in his house. Crack, heroin, weed you name it. He has been in prison for around 4 years now.	I built homes in Juarez & Oaxaca for families that were living in scrap-shacks. These regions became even more inundated by cartel violence over the years. Some of these families were murdered by the cartels for their homes. The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.	0
What word or phrase that has become offensive or not "politically correct" in your lifetime do you refuse to stop using?	Back in college, we were doing a group project, where one of the relevant articles was on obesity. We presented the project. One of the professor's comments was that we shouldn't use the term obesity, as it was offensive to her. But seriously, that's a scientific term and was used in some of the research articles cited.	I don't know I say pretend marriage when it comes to homosexuals or say partner even if they say their married and call anyone pretending to change their gender by their real name ( Bruce Jenner, Bradley Manning ect) I don't dislike the people but I won't compromise to be wrong with them. I'll be disagreeable if it turns into arguments Don't think anyone will top that and thankfully I have enough karma to keep talking	1
What is something slightly evil that you take pleasure in?	Not finishing the tracks on Roller Coaster Tycoon and watching the car go sailing off into a crowd of people or body of water.	i like to buy things that little kids want to have but don't get them from their parents. a few month ago i saw a boy that wanted to have a bick, black, stuffed gorilla, his mother was argue against him. i took the gorilla in front of his nose and buyed it. he followed me and the gorilla with his eyes through the whole shop and it felt great.	1
People who work in the wedding/marriage industry, what is the craziest drama you’ve experienced at a wedding?	I wasn't working that weekend, thank the lord, but: Bride asks for money only as wedding presents. During dancing, she sneaks over to the basket full of the envelopes and opens them up, counting her take. It's less than she hoped, so she calls the police, gets the DJ to stop the music, and accuses the waitstaff of stealing her gifts. Lines up the guests, asks each one publicly how much they gave her. Screams at the police when they arrive to do something. Sues the restaurant, or at least was threatening to when I stopped working there.	Arrived at the wedding really late with a young relative of the grooms family. Father of the bride wasn't happy with the groom because he was hoping for his cousin instead. So he had the band crossbow them, then they slit their throats and slaughtered their army. EDIT: Forgot about mounting a direwolves head on the corpse of the original fiancés torso.	1
Prison Guards/People who work in Prisons, have you ever interacted with an inmate that you were sure was innocent?	I had an issue with my urinary tract. I worked in a prison where the inmates were on death row, about to get the electric chair. This particular inmate had the ability to take on my illness to himself then excrete it through his mouth as some sort of spirit that entered into evil men. He was accused on killing two young girls, but I've come believe that when he was found at the scene, he was actually trying to revive them.	Slightly different scenario but when I was in Afghanistan the ANP (Afghanistan National Police) arrested three fighting age males, whilst on a joint patrol with us. We knew 100% that the men were innocent, we told the ANP this and gave evidence but that didn't stop them from executing the poor guys.	0
I'm a 32 y/o male. To this day, I still drop whatever I'm doing and rush outside to see a plane or helicopter flying overhead. Reddit, what other small things are you fascinated by that others just don't care about?	The moon. I'm always fascinated by the moon. It doesn't have to be full or anything special. I just love looking at it. Especially when it's out during the day. It's beautiful.	>I'm an emotionally stunted manchild with a [crippling porn addiction](www.reddit.com/user/headmustard/).

If you let both eyes get used to the dark, then cover one eye and let the other get used to light again, then turn off the light and uncover your eye, your mind can't tell if the eye that was used to light is opened or closed. What cool mind/body tricks do you know?	stand in a doorway and push your arms out as hard as you can against the frame for about 30 seconds and then step out and they raise involuntarily	Lay on the ground on your belly, then have your friend hold your arms up while you relaxe and have your head hanging down. Do this for about 30 seconds then get your friend to slowly put your arms down and you should start to feel like your falling in a hole.

What's your useless talent?	I'm flawless with tongue twisters - including the one considered the most difficult in English. "The sixth sick sheik's sixth sheep's sick."	I can identify any movie from the past 20 years from just listening to a 5 second sound or video clip.	1
Why don't they sell variety packs of soft drinks (mixed carton of Coke, Sprite, Mello Yello, Barq's, etc.) the same way they sell variety packs of snack chips and breakfast cereals?	They do. Just have to look in the diabetes aisle right next to the bulk acne and no girlfriend. WHY THE FUCK IS THIS ON THE FRONT PAGE.	Rainbow packs baby. Grape, orange, cream soda and root beer. They exist, but only in 24 cans and only those flavors.	0
Mail workers of Reddit, what do you do with children's letters to Santa?	Not a mail worker, but in Canada letters so Santa are opened, read, and responded to by volunteers coordinated through Canada Post. In Canada, Santa even has a Postal Code: H0H 0H0	What about letters to god? EDIT: I don't know why I'm getting downvoted. It's a serious question. Do they get returned as 'undeliverable'? or is there some procedure like letters to Santa?	1
What fact about yourself will always sting?	That I was in gifted classes and had high grades as a child, and now I'm almost 30 and working retail after dropping out of college. I know my parents love me, but I'm also very aware that I'm a disappointment.	I'm not Cisgender. I'm mostly proud to be who I am. I'm starting to feel good and pretty and overall much happier. But it will always sting that I never got to grow up as a little girl.	1
What was the most unfair and infuriating thing that's ever happened to you?	buddy my best friend's wife got hot for me and I was a good guy and told her no. He returned the favor by getting obsessed with me and fucking my life up. Always fuck a married woman if she asks for it.	In 4th grade my teacher graded an answer on my test as wrong when it was actually right. I brought it to her and she accused me - in front of the entire class - of changing my answer and trying to trick her. I had never cheated in my entire life, was humiliated and devastated and cried in front of everyone. She never fixed my grade. I'm still mad at that evil witch.	0
What is your favorite TV Show/Movie Fan Theory or Fan Film that you've heard/seen?	Not a movie, but a game. Portal stories: Mel. It was so incredible not only that it kept the quality of the original 2 games, but it made the puzzles harder, had a great storyline, and the ending in superb. The best part is that it’s free. I’d recommend to any budget valve fan.	There was one about Courage the cowardly dog and it basically said that all of the monsters and shit he saw was just shit like the postman and visitors but because he was a dog he didn't know what they were. It also explains why he lives in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, because he is a dog, he doesn't recognise anything outside so assumes he is alone.	0
What book is absolutely hilarious?	"Guards! Guards!" by Terry Pratchett. Remember all those fantasy novels where the brave hero gets into trouble in an evil city and slays all the hapless city guards who are sent to bring him down? What if you wrote a comic fantasy novel about the hapless city guards who are just supposed to die and vanish? Only they don't. It's funny as hell, with more odd characters wandering through than you can count, and absurd footnotes and mini-essays that pop up in the middle of action on things like, how do you know when you wake up from being knocked unconscious, that you're regaining consciousness to something that you actually want to know about? This novel kicked off Pratchett's City Watch series, one of my favorite Discworld subseries, and it is by far the funniest of them.	I stopped reading after they stole the ship and went to the planet where they went underground or some sort. I thought it was god awful, and I guess British humor is lost on me. Switched to Name of the Wind, which was much more pleasurable.	1
Thinking about signing up to donate bone marrow. Marrow donors, what's the experience like?	When I was in grade 6 I had to get some bone marrow taken for test, now i was given 6 freezing needles and none of them did anything (I was told im immune but i dunno all I know is the doctor told me they were not working) After it was over i was told people on the other side of the hospital could hear me screaming.	Do it, you will probably never get called but if you do, then you'll almost certainly be the ONLY person who matches....you'll directly save someones life. My 9 year old son owes his life to a bone marrow donor. If he/she hadn't gone in after getting called, I wouldn't have my boy today. As far as my family is concerned, this anonymous donor is a Superhero. Do it guy....	0
Campers of Reddit, what's the creepiest/scariest thing you've experienced in the great outdoors?	My brother and I were camping in our remote lake cabin during a dry summer. One night, while sleeping in the cabin, we woke up, smelling intense wood smoke. When we went outside, the woods all around us were **one fire** - and spreading toward us, quickly. We grabbed our gear and got into the canoe - our only means of escape - and paddled out into the lake. We sat there, watching our cabin burn, and everything around it, as we paddled further away for clean air to breathe. Both of us had nightmares from the experience for a long time thereafter. Even now, it's difficult to think of, knowing how hard our parents worked to create that camp, and how quickly everything was destroyed.	watch Bobcat Goldthwaites Bigfoot movie Willow Creek and you will absolutely be freaked out camping. I am sure I would have canceled any camping trip I had planned for a whole summer after watching it. It starts super slow but finishes up nicely.	1
What is more expensive than it should be?	TI-84 calculator. The technology is really old.

Male redditors: what is the stupidest thing you have said to a girl, that blew your chances with her?	so one time when i was shit faced, i am making out with this girl sitting on my lap in a room upstairs from a party and her friend walks in. She sit on the girl's lap and they start making out. I fucking said, "Hey you can't do that." And they both walked away.	"you look familiar!? where do I know you from!?" "my wiener was poking out of shorts one time and you pointed it out [faggy laugh]" "oh, well i have to go, bye"	1
Former/current sex toy shop employees, what's your best customer story?	A real call I got once as customer service for a sex toy manufacturer: Me: "how can I help you?" Them: "I'm not able to get the dildo in!" Me: "Okay where are you trying to put the dildo?" Them: "SIR, I am NOT a sex person so I don't know." Me: "Do you know orifice you're using?" Them: "I don't know what that is!" Me: "Okay, are you trying to put it in round the front or..." Them: "SIR, I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT I AM NOT A SEX PERSON, YOU'RE REFUSING TO HELP ME SO I'M GOING TO HANG UP"	Had video rental rooms with a $20 deposit. Use the Kleenex, don't urinate in the trash can, you'll get your deposit back. Why we had the urination rule was bizarre to me. Then I had to tell a guy he wasn't getting his deposit back.	0
[Serious] Registered sex offenders of Reddit: what is life like for you?	My friend was going through some rough times and got drunk one night and picked up a hooker. She said she was 19 when she was actually 15. He gets caught, thrown in jail, fired from his teaching job, kicked out of his apartment. S O aren't allowed to live within 2500ft of a school, but there are schools 2000ft from each other here. So he's living on the street and committed suicide last night. All because a hooker lied about her age.	I've worked in a group home with a half dozen sex offenders under DDS/DMH for the past several years. It's mostly in house activities and minimal, monitored, community interaction. Most of our guys can not find jobs and instead volunteer at Salvation Army and animal shelters. I could probably answer questions if you have anything more specific.	0
Redditors who were cheated on, how did you get past it?	I broke up with her on the spot.. when she came around a week later asking for forgiveness and a 2nd chance I told her that I had really loved her, but it's over and I can't go back to being with her. Her heart was broken and I just hoped that time would allow us both to get past this eventually. I mean.. I really cared for her and I wanted her to be happy, but *she* broke *my* heart and I couldn't settle for that shit. I knew that we'd both move on, but it'd be tough. Then I didn't date again for 4 years. Yup, didn't get another girlfriend till I was 16.	For me it was all about realizing that it wasn't my fault. It wasn't because I didn't love her enough, or that I didn't give her enough space or whatever the slew of excuses were. It was because she was a shitty person. That for me was the hardest part to swallow because after so many years you think you know a person. Then all of the sudden that shatters around you and you cant come to grips with the fact that it was a lie. Keep your head up OP, and remember, it's not your fault.	0
What is the #1 rule of life?	Trust no man or bitch on this planet. Don't trust God either. The time will come when you can trust all Aliens but be patient.	Enjoy the little things There are lots of them in hiding and when you find them they make it a hell of a lot easier to get through your day.	0
What is the most bizarre thing a complete stranger has ever said to you?	One time an obviously inebriated guy asked me if we were in New Mexico or Old Mexico. We were in Austin.	I'm a lady married to a lady, so I deal enough with remarks from family or coworkers asking about my "husband" or who my "friend" is that's always with me. Last weekend at the store, some dude gets in the elevator with us and apropos of nothing, asks "So, you guys friends?" I stare at him. "What?" He continues to glance back and forth between the two of us. "Are you guys friends?" What the fuck? I'm just like "...why do you ask? We're married." He just shrugs it off. I'm definitely more sensitive to it because of what I put up with regularly, but it was just so odd and out of left field.	1
If skills were sexually-transmitted, who would you screw and for what skill?	Follow up question - would it still be socially frowned upon to sleep your way to the top? Or would that be considered excellent work ethic?	I don't have sex (asexual checking in!) but if I had to- young Buster Keaton. I want the talent to fall awkwardly without hurting myself and to do those crazy flip things he has going on. Because it's awesome and hilarious. Could also use some athleticism, cause I have none!	1
If someone pulls a gun or knife on you in robbery or attack, should you be allowed (if armed) to knife or shoot them in turn without fear of legal repercussion?	I believe in the right to keep and bear arms (I and my family have permits and carry). I believe in the right to defend yourself and your family, with lethal force if necessary. That said, there must be legal repercussions. Any such self defense should be scrutinized by law enforcement and our courts. If it is found completely justifiable, then the person can be released. But if we do not examine their actions thoroughly, there will be no way to insure some people do not abuse the right, murder somebody and later claim self defense. There must be accountability.	Native Texan here. I have this right currently, and I am a firm believer that I should continue to enjoy it.	0
Cat owners of reddit, how is your servitude going with your fluffy overlord?	Well...it hissed at me once or twice. Scratched up a wooden door and pooped in a box then demanded I clean it up. I told him I'm not a slave a then turned him into a Kitty pot pie and been my own boss ever since.	I just drove to the vet to pick up her medicine, then to another vet that carries the tuna-flavoured kidney diet food she likes, then to the one pet store in my city that sells the salmon-flavoured pill pockets. We then had a brushy-brushy session and now Her Majesty is curled up on her special sunshine chair. Seventeen years and counting. Edit: We are in Canada, not the same online selection unless I pay 5x more than the stores :(	0
You’re having a threesome with the protagonist and antagonist of the last tv show/movie you watched. What’s that like?	I don't even have an answer for this. I'm merely fascinated at the idea and how you came up with such a questions. Bravo!	I was just watching Once Upon A Time and I gotta say I'd be very happy to find myself in this predicament. &#x200B; Edit: Talking about Season 1	0
What's up with all the pedophile accusations? Is this an American phenomenon?	You pretty much hit the nail on the head there. The mainstream media has everyone convinced that their children are in mortal danger every moment of the day.	It's a feminist thing. Accusing men of sexual crimes is a key part of feminism. There's one feminist site that accuses almost every member of the men's rights movement of being a pedophile (in detail individually and by name).	1
Women of Reddit, what thing about men deeply confuses you?	I know it's really only a small percentage of men who do this (and I'm sure there are a few women who do it too) but one thing that's *mainly* a man thing that I just don't get is football violence. Supporting a football team, joining a club, watching them play - ok, I get that. But travelling around and fighting against people who have the audacity to support a different team...? Yeah, I can't get my head around that.	Asked Girlfriend, her responses: 1.Mansplaining 2.The amount of insecurities 3.The amount of silly obvious lies said in attempt to make them seem better.	1
Experienced Dungeon Masters and Players of Tabletop Roleplaying Games, what is your advice for new players learning the genre?	* Don't start with D&D. D&D is a very bad system for roleplaying, and has too complicated and slow rules to be much fun. * Screw the rules. The rules in a RPG is for support, they are not the law. Use the rules for situations which cannot be resolved by common sense. * Don't be afraid to have fun. If I were to suggest some good starter games, I'd suggest Call of Cthulhu for roleplaying, Paranoia for just having fun (if you don't have stomach cramps from laughing, you are not playing it right). If you want combat heavy gaming (which I think is rather boring, as it becomes soooo slow), don't go D&D, there are many better systems.	A common noobie mistake is to create an edgy loner character who has no reason to work with the group. Don't do that. RPGs are cooperative games.	0
What is one 'medical' condition that someone you know claims they have that drives you up a wall?	Fibromyalgia or Hypoglycemia. Fibromyalgia used to be used as a term given to patients when they had "chronic pain all over" for no other reason. Usually resulted in people acquiring narcotic pain medications for absolutely no reason at all. Hypoglycemia - You're hungry and shaky, eat something.	I don't know if this quite counts, but I recently confronted someone who was obviously sick, coughing/hacking all over the place without covering his mouth. He assured me that it was ok: "It's not contagious because my immune system is so strong that the virus is too busy fighting it to spread to anyone else"	0
Guys of Reddit, what things do you secretly hate about bro culture?	Fuck "bros before hoes". Whomever made that up is the idiot that can't get laid and fucks up every opportunity (usually by acting like an asshole), so he would rather bring the rest of us down than take one for the team. Sorry, love my dudes, but it's not my fault you're a chump- take our advice and stop acting like an immature idiot, maybe you'll find a chick to date you.	Obviously this isn't just a bro thing; women do it too, but I feel so judged if a girl I'm interested in isn't smokin' hot. My roommate is always talking about girls like "There's no way I'd get with her. She was only like a seven." I'm definitely not the least judgmental person out there, and I can be shallow, but I do care about personality if I'm looking for something more than a hook up.	0
What is the most fucked up thing you found out about someone but never told a soul?	I always thought my uncle was creepy, unsafe, and I wondered why my mom never let me near him alone. Found out recently that he raped one of his younger sisters (not my mother) with a bunch of other guys in high school. The family goes on like nothing happened and my aunt obviously suffers from severe anxiety and PTSD. It is so infuriating and disgusting.	In a (slightly buzzed) game of truth or dare, the boy (my childhood friend, first crush ever) that everyone including my parents thinks is super innocent, admitted that not only does he jack off all the time to some kinky porn, he also wants to try getting off with various types of toys. Changed the way I look at that gentle, clear headed boy forever. There are just some things I never wanted to know about him.	1
If you went missing right now, what mundane but “unusual” things have you done in the last 24-48hours that would have unnecessary significance poured into them?	The fact that after having hardly any money in my bank account I just went to deposited very large amount of my savings into it.	Watching videos of people criticizing Onision and I made a tweet about him. I guess he came here to show me, a filthy meat eater, what his vegetarian body can do.	1
What's the weirdest real name you've ever heard?	Chlamidia (we talked mom out of it, but she was set on naming her daughter this) Also Sharron Dick. Always makes me laugh. (Married into the name)	Guy in my high school was named Repent, which I thought was weird. Then I found out his parents were religious nuts and his full first name was Repentyoursins. That was weirder.	0
Women of Reddit: as a guy, what non-sexual things can I do to impress you?	Don't just listen. REMEMBER. I cannot emphasize enough how much of a turn off it is to be repeatedly asked basic questions like "What do you do again?" or "What did you say your major was again?" when you have talked about it before. If you want to impress a girl, listen when she talks, and then actually bring up something she's talked about in the next conversation. If she has a deadline at work or a test coming up, remember this and ask her how it went. Women eat this shit up.	You're asking the wrong people. If you want to know the way the prey behaves, don't ask the prey, ask the predator. /r/seduction	1
My brother (32 yrs old) has not spoken to me (30 yrs old) for almost one year because I deleted a couple of his TV programmes on TiVo after he deleted one of mine. Any other adults still act like children with their siblings?	I let my brother in law borrow a 1k and I have not heard from him or my sister in about a year. Won't answer phone calls or anything. I got played hard.	What was the show? If it were, say Arrested development, Firefly, Game of thrones or a few others, Reddit will side with your brother.	1
What would be some of the useless classes you would have to take at Hogwarts?	Defence Against the Dark Arts. They never needed to know that stuff. Or Gastronomy. Probably a spell for every gourmet dish.	Art History. But instead of history of the different artist movements it would be the history of the people who live in the paintings and what they do.	0
What is the stupidest thing you ever saw a person get offended for?	I said "okie-dokey." It was at a summer camp when I was 11, we were making s'mores. Each adult was in charge of giving us kids an ingredient. When I got the final ingredient, the lady said, "okay, now go have a seat and start making some s'mores!" and I said, "okie-dokey." Her: "What did you just say young man? Tell me what you said!" Me: "Okie-dokey." Her: "Don't lie to me! I want you to tell me what you said!" Me: "I promise, all I said was okie-dokey." Her, with a scowl: "I don't want to hear you swear again, do you understand?" To this day I don't know what swear sounds like okie-dokey.	A few weeks ago, Beyoncé performed at the Superbowl halftime show. She was wearing... an outfit... or something, I guess? I don't know, but anyway, conservatives went apeshit over it, because those motherfuckers will get offended at **everything**.	1
People who drive large trucks with Confederate flags and/or truck nuts: what was your relationship with your mother like growing up?	What the fuck is the point of this question? As if having the latest Apple shit and drinking Starbucks makes one soooo enlightened. I think truck nuts are stupid too but at least when I see someone's proud of being a redneck I also see someone who can probably operate machinery vs someone who went to college and is doing nothing with it. Those people are the fucking worst.	I'm from an area where these truck accessories are very popular (the South). These dudes seem to have good relationships with their moms. Its them books they don't get along with.	0
Whats the lamest excuse you've given to get off the phone with someone?	"Sorry, my grandma is calling, I gotta go." I didn't realize how much I used it until a friend asked me why the hell I talked to my grandma so much.	"dogs taking a shit, gotta go, no he's outside why? Yes its in the grass, because he's taking a shit and that's more interesting.*hangs up*" my ex girlfriend	1
When electing a United States President, why not have all the candidates take an SAT type test that quizzes them on all areas pertinent to presiding and make the results available to the public before voting?	The public wouldn't care. I honestly think Trump could have gotten a zero on the SAT and the right still would act as if his shit don't stink.	You couldn't even finish proposing the idea before people would be yelling 'bias.' Any preferred candidate who scored low on the test would be hollered out as obvious evidence of corrupt test-makers.	0
"Gun control" is a very vague term. Supporters, what specific law would you like to see passed, and in what way do you think it would help?	Gun-free zones should be made illegal. All they do is disarm law-abiding citizens. The criminals don't care if they are gun-free, as a matter of fact, they are glad because they know they will be the only one armed.	Not a huge gun control supporter but I would like the background check system to be available to private citizens. So if I want to conduct a private sale I can still do a background check on the person I am selling to without paying $50 to a gun shop.	0
Reddit, can we guess your lie in two truths and a lie?	I'm the third of seven kids I graduated college with a music degree I got a free pass through college because I could play bagpipes.	1. This is my top comment. 2. This comment is gilded. 3. This is a bold attempt at karma that will possibly fail.	1
A year ago I grew my hair to a ridiculous length thinking it looked good (it looked quite the opposite in actuality). Reddit, what is something you are ashamed that the younger version of yourself did?	The younger version of me dropped out of college when my parents were still willing to help me pay for it. The younger version of me was a idiot.	Cut my hair short in high school, and then dyed half of it (the underneath) black. With permanent color. My only two options when I decided I was sick of the black was let it grow out and have my hair look like shit for a very very long time, or bleach it and pray my hair didn't fall out. I went with option #2 but my hair will never be as long or as healthy as it used to be. It just won't grow past a few inches below my shoulders, which sucks because I REALLY want long hair. Stupid lesbian phase.	1
Parents who found out your child was a bully, how did you deal with the situation?	Not a parent, but i was a bully as a child, but this stemmed from being bullied, so i used it as a way to cope. I think the biggest question is why and what can be done?	The biggest bully that went after me at school, with all the names, pushing, pranks etc His mother WORKED for the school So I told her "Your son is a real ass.." Her reply "Yeh I know.." With a disappointed face	0
Whats a big industry secret that isn't supposed to be known by the general public?	Time shares are not a good deal. Diet Coke feeds cancer. Cracker Jack prizes suck. The rubber floor mats are always free. Quinoa is actually bugs.	You only need a half the toothpaste you use. This was widely known until sometime in the 50s when an ad agency doubled the sales of a toothpaste company by using a picture of toothpaste covering the entire toothbrush.	0
How much eye contact is socially appropriate?	PRO-TIP: instead of looking into someone's eyes look at their nose they won't be able to tell the difference and you wont feel uncomfortable. Also you should maintain eye contact.	Depends entirely on the situation, but here are a few common examples: On a first date, I'd say about 70% is appropriate. You want to gaze, not stare. In a business setting, I'd say keep it as close to 100% as you can. It demonstrates the utmost in confidence and makes you seem secure in your position. When committing a violent crime, keep it to a minimum. You don't want them to tell the police your eye color.	0
Pick any 2 movies from the same actor. Those movies are now part of the same reality. What happened to the actor to get them from movie A to movie B?	Ewan McGreggor, trainspotting and star wars TPM. After getting off of heroin and getting his life back together, he finds his true calling in the jedi arts, trains hard, and becomes Obi Wan Kenobi.	Edward Norton undergoes psychoactive therapy to get the Hulk under control. After many painful years, he manages to successfully get one split personality under control, only to release another - Tyler Durden.	0
What's the most ridiculous policy your employer ever enacted or tried to enact?	I have a buddy who worked for a very large asphalt paving company, his division had approximately 300 employees. Each employee was terminated a week before Christmas and re-hired after the new year. They were all forced to take a 2 week vacation and never gained benefits because not one worked a full year.	Boss made me sign a paper that said if I was ever late again that I would be fired. Company has a 3 minute "grace period" for clocking in and I was almost always within that grace period. The reason I was ever late? Stressed out about having to deal with him.	1
What is the worst emotion?	Would anxiety be considered an emotion? That feeling when you find yourself wanting to do just about anything, but everything you can think to do comes with some fabricated reasoning of why you can't or won't actually do it. Is this anxiety or am I confusing myself? I'm routinely in that state. It sucks.	Powerlessness. When you strip someone of their ability to have an effect on their immediate surroundings, they'll sink into despair in a mere heartbeat. A good example of this is that feeling when the person you like doesn't like you back, but it applies across the board.	0
Cab drivers of reddit: what is the most absurd place someone has asked you to take them to/ who is the most absurd person you've had in your cab?	My dad locked his keys in his car. He had to get my brother and I home from the visit or face deep shit from my mom's side of the family, and he didn't think a locksmith would work quickly enough. So he calls a cab, figuring out he'll get back into the car after he drops us off. The driver pulls up, and says basically 'no, no, this isn't right' and pulls out a slim jim, getting into the car in seconds. He saved my dad the money of a lock smith AND of paying the taxi fare. My dad tried to pay him for his time and he refused to accept it. Cool guy.	Not a cab driver but a funny story none the less. A few friends and I were in Vegas when we decided to get a cab to get to another Casino. During the ride I guess my friend noticed the guys interesting name (don't remember it) and decided to take out his phone and take a picture of his taxi permit, camera flash and all. So, for the next 10 minutes of this ride the Indian cabbie began interrogating us as to why he did that, are we reporting him, asking us who we were etc. Needless to say I was stoked when we finally got out.	1
[Serious] Parents of Reddit, what is something you neglected to teach your child until it was "too late"?	I was late in teaching my kids to ride a bike. When they were younger, we lived in a place that didn't have a safe place to ride bikes. Now, my oldest is 15 and I am trying. But he's too tall and big and heavy for me to hold on and run beside him while he's on the bike like you see in movies. I am not sure what to do. He has balance problems and can only go .5 sec before starting to fall over.	Child here, my parents always taught me abstinence from things like drugs, and sex, when in reality the best way to teach about these things is responsible use and participation.	1
What was the most rebelious thing you did as a kid?	As a kid? I straight up lied to my dad's face about having a school project on the solar system. I even made up a deadline so we'd have plenty of time. But I just wanted to make something with him. Not sure why I lied.	That’s easy. Listening to death metal at an early age. Stole my parents cars all through middle school to meet girls in other towns. Used drugs often. Told my dad (son of a Methodist pastor) god isn’t real, to his face. Got many a tattoo. Became a total degenerate and decided to drop out of college to work on a road crew. Still have a good relationship with my parents. Just had to figure out who I was. I’m a shit bird and proud of it. I still use drugs and alcohol on a regular basis. Fuck your god.	1
[Serious] Whats the worst parenting you've ever seen?	Lisa's mom, hands down. I've never heard her say anything to anyone that wasn't horrible, especially to her daughter. Sided with Lisa's rapist. Tried to hire a hit man to kill Lisa. It's not really surprising that Lisa ended up in prison.	Mother banging on the glass to get the attention of a gorilla in the zoo next to her son and a sign saying "Please don't bang on the glass". I know there are far worse examples of bad parenting but this one just struck a chord with me. EDIT:For spelling	0
What is your cheesiest science joke?	A scientist and his friend walk into a bar. The scientist asks for a cup of h2o. His friend asks for a glass of h2o too. RIP friend	A group of scientists watch as one of their colleagues is about to jump off a building, when one of them yells "don't do it! You have so much potential!"	0
Having lunch with Darrell Issa tomorrow. Now that CISPA is headed to the Senate, what's the best way to use this conversation?	The biggest concern I have, is why are we in such a rush to force these bills through? Why aren't we sitting down with committees of experts who truly understand all aspects of these issues, and actually putting together a bill we could all feel good about? There must be some very clear, specific language that could give us the power to secure us against cyber security threats, without leaving massive holes in the language that leave our citizens privacy and rights in jeopardy. Everyone ought to be on board with doing this the right way.	Be sure to use a wheel lock when you park your car, and keep a careful eye on him if he leaves to use the bathroom. Thank you kn0thing for everything you have done/continue to do today. I consider the information exchange that is Reddit to be one of the greatest things done in the Internet age. I've learned so many things on here that have been beneficial to me in my day-to-day life and I am grateful to you and other developers for making this possible.	1
Reddit, what have you made a complete 180 on?	The death penalty. And not because I'm morally opposed to it. I always thought it was cheaper to send a murderer to Death Row. Apparently, it costs about five times as much as sentencing someone to life when you factor in court costs and whatnot. So, fuck 'em. Let them sit in misery until they die of old age.	Being socialist and an SJW. Back in 2008ish, I would have called myself a socialist without a second thought. I always found the idea of libertarianism attractive, but I felt like it wasn't a safe choice. Now (and for the past many years), I proudly call myself a libertarian. I care a lot more about freedoms than trying to level a playing field or create some sort of socially-just society. I also don't give a single fuck about being politically correct. I know how to exist in polite society and I won't say shit that offends specific friends of mine to their faces, but I'll laugh my ass off at a good rape joke and hearing Gordon Ramsay call someone a cunt slays me every time.	1
What technologies from 2019 would seem like science fiction to people from the 1950s?	Show them a pocket calculator. It wouldn't be invented for another 15 years but today they cost about 2 cents to make and it's a technology they could wrap their heads around. After they wrap their heads around that, then show them a smartphone.	Probably a projector, it sometimes seems insane even to me how we can basically throw light and it has a very organized pattern that with some input we can change many times a second. I was born in 2004 just to be clear and I live in a small town in England. In my school we use these every day. I’m still amazed.	1
What is something you're hiding from your SO and why?	I have next Monday off. It sounds small, but I'm hoping she'll be excited to wake up and discover me in the living room playing with our kids.	That before her, I used POF/OKC as ways to easily bang tons of sloots. She would see this as shallow and asshole-ish.. Probably because it was.	1
What annoying phrase really grinds your gears?	"Served his country." How the fuck do you know whether or not someone who was in the military served their country?	"Other people have it worse". Ok I understand that but don't belittle my personal probelms just because I'm not a slave in the sex trade or a starving child in Africa or something doesn't mean I'm not having trouble. It's all relative.	0
I recently learned that when someone offers you a glass of fine whiskey/scotch, it is incredibly rude to finish your drink before the person who offered it to you. What other rules of etiquette do I not know about?	Etiquette by and large is rich people creating rules because they have no other problems to deal with. Don't be a dick, only rule of etiquette. Did my eating with the wrong fork affect you in anyway apart from your delicate sense of etiquette? No? Then calm down and fucking have a good time. Did my double dipping turn you off having some salsa? It did? Well fuck my bad, I won't do it again. Super simple stuff. Edit: The double dipping is there to illustrate that while I think a lot of etiquette is largely irrelevant that there is very good reason for it existing, like why you don't double dip.	When playing poker for money, it's *very* rude to reveal your cards slowly for effect - especially if you know you have the winning hand. It's called "slow-rolling", and I learned this the hard way by getting screamed at and kicked out of a home-game.	0
What do you want to see more of in movies and on TV?	Villain protagonists. Not only would it be interesting to see more stories from the villain's point of view, stories with villain protagonists force the writer to at least attempt to write an interesting, three-dimensional villain with understandable motivations. There are many stories where I find the villain more interesting than the goody-two-shoes hero. And when the villain is good as a character, the central conflict as a whole is more interesting.	More non-white people in fantasy shows/movies. Other genres too, but specifically fantasy, because often they'll be set in a "medieval England"-ish type place, and that's used as a reason to end up having an all white cast	1
What bad heredity traits are you stuck with?	My paternal grandfather has had three heart attacks (still alive!) My paternal grandmother died of a heart attack. My dad died from a sudden heart attack. I have heart palpitations at 34. Sometimes when I'm alone in the house and my chest flutters, I fucking panic and go sit on the porch, so that if I collapse or something, at least a neighbor might see me.	Disabled feet (born clumpfoods). Also, my sister is authistic and I dicided not to have kids unless I can outrule that they might be as well (hurray for the modern medicin!)	1
Today, i went back to my highschool to say goodbye to a teacher who had a huge impact on me. He was retiring. With tears in his eyes, he looked around his classroom and said, "i liked it". I almost cried. What's simple words have been emotional tidal waves to you?	At my grandfather's viewing, when my grandmother leaned in and said "we had a good life, didn't we?" As if she had died too.	"LET'S GO CELTICS" Edit: At the Celtics game last night they were down by 20 with 3 minutes left and the crowd started chanting this. It was really cool and showed how real fans stick around and support their team even during a loss. I probably should have clarified but there's no need to down vote.	1
What's the weirdest "wrong number" call or text you've ever received?	I got a voicemail at work from some guy that went to an album release party (he was in the industry) at some strip club in Staten Island. Apparently there Dakota Fanning (18 at the time of the call) was working as a 15 year old underage prostitute giving $50 blowjobs at this particular event. "The internet says she's 18 but she's really only 15" was his exact quote. There was a lot of other crazy ramblings (other celebrities were also prostitutes for the low low price of $50 that night), but that is all I can specifically remember.	New year's eve when I was about 10 years old, it was just past midnight and I answered the phone saying happy new year! Guy on the other end says the same but with a German accent, I asked who he wanted to talk to and he said anyone from the USA. We chatted for 30 minutes or so, exchanged mailing addresses and became pen pals for numerous years. That was almost 30 years ago, we've lost touch with each other but it was pretty weird and cool at the same time.	0
What would Ferris Bueller do in 2015?	There wouldn't be a Ferris because Ferris was just a figment of Cameron's imagination, like Tyler Durden in Fight Club. Cameron would be on really powerful anti-psychotic drugs in 2015, so his whole day would be staring at math problems in school. It would be mentally impossible for him to conjure up Ferris, let alone consider his unrequited desire for Sloane.	As soon as he hacks into his schools intranet, the breach is detected. An FBI cybersecurity task force traces the source to his house where he is promptly arrested, tried as an adult, convicted, and spends several years in prison.	0
What little known fact do you know?	Vending machines kill more people than sharks Diabesity is a real word (I think you can guess what it means) Tongue prints are as distinctive as finger prints The ringing sound of bells is referred to as tintinnabulation Dactylography is the science of using fingerprints to identify someone. Jerry regularly consumes products containing caffeine on Seinfeld even though he claims not to consume any.	inside the cooling tower of chernobyl, there's a mold growing. It feeds off of the radiation the same way plants feed off sunlight. And it's edible itself. EDIT: To clarify about it being edible, I mean it is totally edible. The same way plants aren't filled with sunlight, this thing isn't filled with any super nuclear death.	0
What sexual desires have you not had the opportunity to do yet, but fantasize about?	I desperately want to have sex with a lawyer who is representing me as a client. Unfortunately, I'm broke. On the bright side, I'm not in any kind of serious trouble.	Frenetically initiated sex. My body is receptive to the mere fantasy of unadulterated primitive sex, so consumed with amorous desires and a fervency so potent you’re yearning to have him inside you. All predetermined decorum constrains are discarded, forbearance is a forgien concept to you both, and when you finally acquiesce to the relentless lust; it’s such a moment of relief until you realise this is just the start. This isn’t the perfunctory reaction we have when we observe someone objectively attractive, it’s the one person to beckons to that isolated and preserved primal instinct we have retained since humanity’s beginning. I want that frenetic urgency which demands to be satiated. I’ve never found anyone who ignites anything that bares a resemblance but my imagination suffices for now...AO3 here I go!	1
Reddit, whats the worst violation of gym etiquette you've witnessed?	When I put my gear in front of the machine or equipment I’m using (ie. cable machine, bench, squat rack) and I go and use the bathroom or go get a sip of water and I turn around and somebody already took it	The gym I used to go to had ALL WHITE towels to wipe the machines down with. ALL WHITE, like not a single beige or grey towel. I had a dark blue towel with sports team logo on it. Very obviously NOT A GYM TOWEL. There was a ledge beside the squat rack where I had my towel, water bottle, phone, and chalk all in a pile. WHILE I"M IN THE MIDDLE OF A SET, some fucking TROGLODYTE moved my shit off my towel and then used it to wipe his sweat AND THEN RETURNED IT TO THE GYM TOWEL BIN...WITH THE OTHER WHITE TOWELS. RIP Towlie 2016-2017 you belong to the gym now.	0
What is one thing people do NOT want for christmas?	Gift cards. Don't force me to spend virtual money at a store I don't shop at, only to have to fork over a few bucks at the register to keep there from being a few bucks left on the card. We prefer cash. Please don't buy a present for the company. (don't buy gift cards)	When we were younger my brother and I thought it would be funny as hell to give our little sister coal for Christmas. We were 8 or 9 I think at the time and she was younger so of course she cried her eyes out so I'm gonna go with coal if you're a kid.	0
You have access to Donald Trump's Twitter account for 3 minutes. What tweets would you send?	Just met the aliens, they're great! Just showed me how sugar and corn syrup is used to fatten people for harvest. They're great	Islam is a great religion. A wonderful religion. There is no god but Allah and Mohammed is his prophet! Inshallah!	1
If a religion other than your own was proven to be indisputably true, which one would you want it to be and why?	Daoism. * Possibility of becoming an immortal or god? ✔ * Being able reign about life and death? ✔ * Being able to adventure through the universe? ✔ * Being able to use 'magic' ✔	Atheism, because then it wouldn't be one of those reincarnation religions and then when I die I would just actually be dead and not have to worry about anything ever again	1
What did you witness as a child, but didn't understand it at the time?	On the way to primary school my friend got pulled into a white van. He was released two minutes later further down the road, understandably shaken up. We told the school. The following weeks we play cop and looked for the white van, but soon forgot about it - well at least I did, I'm sure it wasn't quite so easy for him. Anyway, many many years later I was on a camping trip with my brothers who are 6+ years older than me. I told this story and how it had confused me. They filled me in on the key detail that was: my friends brother, in the same year as my eldest brother, was heavily in to drugs and owed money to his drug dealer. When my friend got picked up it was a warning to his older brother. Blew my mind when I was told that.	I saw a hickey on my aunt's neck. I asked her about it. She said an insect bit her. I know how hickeys look now. Lel	1
What's the most absurd excuse someone has given you for being late that turned out to be true?	Had a staff member call me to say they weren't sure they could come into work because someone had stolen their front door. I lived around the corner from them so on the way to work I drove past their house and sure enough they were there with the police filing a report on a missing door.	“I was fucking your sister.” In my defense, I didn’t think he could open the coffin. Oh, well... at least he got a shock seeing her still alive.	1
What is your favourite song right now and why?	Lil Pump - Gucci Gang. Its so catchy and is essentially an anthem to mindless consumerism and an extravagant lifestyle, as well as prevalence over poverty to a much more luxurious lifestyle, all of which appeal to a teenage audience, if you consider 19 year old me a teenager.	Iris - Goo Goo Dolls, it has always been a favourite of mine, but it will always be my favourite after it was the first song that came on the radio when I started the car when I left the hospital after my dad had passed away	0
Reddit,How old are you and what's the biggest current problem in your life?	I'm 62 and having trouble finding a job. I sometimes wonder if I've retired and just don't know it yet.	I’m Rick Harrison and this is my pawn shop. I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss, and in 23 years I’ve learned one thing. You never know what is gonna come through that door.	1
What interesting Hidden plot points do you think people missed in a movie?	In Pulp Fiction, Mia thinks Vincent's heroin is cocaine because it's in a plastic baggie. At the retail level, cocaine is sold in baggies. Heroin is sold in balloons. That's why Vince's dealer mentions he's out of balloons and asks if a baggie is ok.	When Kevin shoves Buzz in the beginning of *Home Alone*, milk spills all over the stuff on the counter-- including Kevin's plane ticket (which is then thrown in the trash). The entirety of *Home Alone* happened because of spilt milk.	1
What unique business would you create?	Since I live in THE land of hurricanes, I would create an enormous underground facility with water, food, entertainment, hospital, library, movie screenings, backup power etc. that people could pay an annual fee to be a part of. In the case of a devastating hurricane approaching, members could arrive at the facility and live in comfort until the storm and it's aftermath passed.	Shit ass pet fuckers. A can of dog food is $1,000,000 and we'll fuck your pet. Doesn't matter if you bring em' or not. We'll track the little fucker down. Edit: Look up Louis CK's video on this. It's amazing.	1
What's the dumbest argument you've ever had with someone?	I let someone argue for about 2 minutes that vaccines caused autism before I said "apparently you are too stupid to discuss this with" and left.	my brother is the king of dumb arguments. He wins them by just saying shit so off-the-wall, that I can't defend against that level of absurdity. Here's just one example. He was arguing that he didn't think we evolved from primates. Not that evolution wasn't real, but we didn't come from primates. Here was his main point: "Think about it, if we evolved from monkeys, than why do so many people look like birds?" YOU WIN	0
Reddit, let's have a stupidity amnesty, what's your "I'm not stupid but..." story?	Once years ago in geometry in HS, I was reading a word problem and looked at it several times before I finally leaned over to my neighbor and said, "what the fuck is tri-pled?" (pronounced try pled) He responded, "....that's tripled."	In this case, welcome to the difference between someone who only has sex in serious relationships, and someone who has sex outside of relationships. Edit: also, if I could have had sex on demand, or anywhere near that, would have had even *way* more sex!	1
What is the most offensive thing a customer has ever said to you?	Mind if I stick a pinecone in your butt while I'm fucking your colostomy hole? What am I, some kind of a whore?	A guy came up to the register and ordered a cheeseburger,(you cant mess that up right?), well i take his money give him his change and a minute later his cheeseburger. A few seconds after i hand him the cheeseburger he looks at me and goes," You stupid inbreed piece of shit i wanted a big mac". I was 16 at the time and was horrified that a grown man would shout at a freaking kid over something that was not my fault... My manager came over and ripped this guy a new one for being so stupid.	0
What would you ask God in an AMA?	What on earth, makes you worthy of my worship when you pretty much couldn't care less about anything you created?	Do you have like, practice Earths? Or other planets where you effed up and had to restart? Are we one of them?	0
Which movie is just the worst piece of crap you've ever seen?	I used to work in a group home for people with disabilities. One client used to be sent cheap dvds by his dad, and it was December so he wanted to watch the new Krampus DVD he was sent. However, this wasn't the probably fun Adam Scott 2015 movie. It was called Krampus: The Christmas Devil, and it was incredibly low budget. Most of the movie was 3 guys in camo walking around the woods in silence with guns. And Krampus literally kept naked women in cages and assaulted them. It seemed more like a snuff film. I had him turn it off around this point.	Gravity. It got such brilliant reviews, but my family and I sat there like 'what the actual hell is this'. Like... Woo she's floating for 3 hours now she's on earth?? And some guys head exploded, if I remember correctly, but that was the only exciting bit, and it was pretty grim.	1
Americans, when you travel from state to state, do you feel culture shock or do you feel like it's sort of the same culture, and why?	I've lived in 6 states now, and crossed the country 4 times. Every once in awhile you see more of a shocking situation, but its rare. Like most have said, urban to rural is the big one, I went from Boston to a town of less than 1000 in Alaska, that was a HUGE shock, but after settling in a bit you get used to things. Edit: didn't expect quite this much attention from this comment! For real though, try to make it to Alaska!	most of america is fairly identical. you've got [large city] surrounded by [boring cookie cutter suburb] leading out to [empty rural town with hicks].	1
Forget worst roommate experiences, Reddit, what's your best/coolest roommate experience?	I heard my housemate coming home from the pub with a friend once when he thought I was asleep, during which he complimented me for ages and said he "couldn't have asked for a better housemate"	Freshman year of college, we had a dorm room meant for two but due to over crowding, we were forced to make it into a triple. I didn't know these two women at all. First night, one told this weird story about anal and her bf's dick "came out all poopy". The remaining two of us just sat there silent. Next day, the cool room mate said to me, "Hey. Do you think 3rd room mate is as weird as I do?" Thank God, YES! We then plotted to get rid of her. Two months later, we were partners in crime making living with us so miserable that the 3rd one moved out. 25 years later, I'm still partners in crime with that good room mate. She's my best friend.	1
Teachers of Reddit, what's the most awkward thing a student of yours has ever told you?	Male teacher here. Girl is crying, during a class - kids are all working. I go over and ask her what's wrong. She whispers: "I'm not supposed to have my period until tomorrow and I'm leaking all over my chair. I whispered it to the parapro, then I went back to the front of the class and said, "Hey guys, the lab is open across the hall - Let's go over there." We leave. Parapro took care of her, other kids never knew. Edit: 7th or 8th grade can't remember which.	Not a teacher but (how reddit) a youth counselor for a church. Was told by a 15 year old that she had a crush on me. Tried to pretend I didn't hear it so she could back out of the statement. She repeated it. I instantly went and told our youth pastor.	1
What is a common misconception that you always correct people on when you hear?	That lady who sued for spilling hot coffee on herself was totally justified. Most people don't know jack about that case and think she was just out to make a quick buck.	People who voted for Trump are all racist and sexist. I'm not defending the bloke and I sure as hell didn't want him as president but people really need to understand not everyone who voted for him are bigots.	1
What is it like to go from society's definition of unattractive to attractive?	25M For me, respect was the biggest thing. Women in general immediately stop talking when I start talking. (Disclaimer: I don't abuse this to talk over people.) As for other things, women striking up a conversation with me is still rare, but it's definitely increased compared to before. And yeah, like other people said, you can definitely get away with more. On the other hand, attractiveness hasn't changed my sense of belonging at all, but since I'm very individualistic and a loner it isn't surprising.	It's a really nice contrast. People are definitely nicer to you for starters. I've also found you can get away with more things like saying stupid stuff or being a little awkward with woman. Altho, this level of obtained confidence can sometimes bring cockeyness, so be sure to not be a total douchebag with people. Everyone should be treated with respect.	0
What is something you think people pretend to hate?	Fast food. That shit doesn't bring in billions of dollars because no one likes it. Lots of y'all are full of shit and shoving down McDonald's/KFC/Taco Bell when no one's looking.	I'm convinced vegetarians pretend to hate meat and actually love it and them being a vegetarian is some sort of masochist thing	1
What is the craziest encounter of 'rich kid syndrome' that you have witnessed/experienced?	I gat 4000$ dollars to my middle school charity to piss off kids that bullied me. They had to count 6000$ in change	Ex-girlfriend's friend said to me, "Can you believe there are people who have never been on a private jet??" "Uhh, yeah, I'm one of them..."	0
What lie are you currently living and do you have a plan to address it?	My husband left a year ago I haven’t told my family. My kids and I live Day to day in a state of numbness. I honestly don’t know how to address it because there was no explanation.	I’ve been in a relationship with someone I really do love for the past 5 years... but she’s a whole “wait till marriage”type person and I’m dying to get any action... sadly I’ve had a slew of slip ups with other girls. Probably never gonna tell her tho.	1
What's the strangest "wrong number" call you've ever recieved?	In college, some guy was *sure* his girlfriend's phone number was what mine was. My roommate and I had an answering machine that said "[a male name] and [also a male name] aren't here, so leave a message," and for a while, this guy kept leaving us messages that were usually some variation of "Dang, Jenny, that's some weird-ass voice mail message you have."	''Shit i hung up, so anyway yeah. We fund ISIS and then overthrow assad and stuff, how about Bill? does he agree with this?''	1
Which city have you visited that has a feeling that no other city has?	Hong Kong. Pretty amazing city. It's more or less built and embedded into the side of mountains where so much nature is preserved. With a 20min walk you go from an amazing city to the sounds of what is more or less the jungle. The architecture is outstanding, and thanks to the police and mobsters it has an incredibly low crime rate. Its got great food for cheap and there is always something to do.	To be honest, my hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee. It's this relatively large city in the middle of this valley. Trees everywhere, lush greenery surrounding this big city with all these buildings. I know places like New York, or Chicago are 10x as big, but to me, Knoxville just has a certain...flavor to it. Old meets new. Hills and hollers meet apartments and stadiums	1
What's the worst spoiler someone has ever done to you?	My husband ruined the Bucky turned Winter Soldier transformation. When Bucky died, I was like “oh my gosh, how sad!”, my husband said something to the effect as “the Winter Soldier never dies........ oh, oops” 😒 I	Reading the last hunger games book. Nephew: “how much of the book is left?” Me: “I’m about 75% of the way through.” Nephew: “oh, are you to the part where Prim dies yet?” Me: “...” Years later, still salty.	0
What is the strangest thing you have seen someone do in a public restroom?	Was washing my hands, guy comes in with a massive traffic cone. Muttering to himself as he walks "Hup hup hup hup." Then shouts "Hyup!" and hurls the traffic cone into an occupied stall. That thing must have weighed 15 pounds, it was huge, then as this guys in the stall shouting and trying to get the thing off him, the other guy leaves going "hup hup hup hup."	In highschool I went to use the bathroom and a middle school kid was in there. The following conversation occured: Him: Will you beat me up? Me: Excuse me? Him: Will you beat me up? I want you to kick my ass. Me: Nope.	1
Parents whose kids never dated/found love/got married, how do you feel about it?	I'm 17 and my dad is worried because I have no desire to date at all. I'm totally down for a life of masturbating, fucking around with synth sounds, and not being told what do to by a woman I once loved and 3 gremlins	I should ask my father. Then again he also never found love, he and my mother only had me because both hate the idea of abortion.	0
You have unlimited $20 bills in your wallet, but the next bill doesn't appear until 3 minutes after you spent the previous $20. How do you strike it rich?	I buy something for $20. I sell it for $40. Keep escalating. Husband bought 2 things off craigslist for $40 the other day (one item replacing a current household item). He was going to sell the old thing for $50 (originally bought with employee discount for $60 regular cost $105). Sold that shit for $70. PROFIT MOTHERFUCKERS DO YOU SPEAK IT? Edit: Apparently some bitches ass punks don't speak pofit.	Gambling. Just keep going until I win big. Edit: I'm getting a lot of comments telling me I'd make more money if I just took the 20 from my wallet every three minutes and saved it. No, I wouldn't. The question says I have to *spend* the money before the next 20 appears.	0
I drove an underage co-worker home after she had been drinking. Now her parents want to talk to me. What do I do/say?	Honestly, it sounds like something my parents would have done just to check facts. It's very easy for a 16 year old to say "Oh msmacnchs drove me home. She's this nice girl I work with and I was in a bind. I didn't get in the car with anyone who was drinking or a boy or anything." In their heads they hear "Oh I got dropped off by some high school loser who took his dads Mercedes out after we got bombed and fooled around in the backseat." They probably just want some back up to her story and see that you 1. Are an actual person. 2. Actually drove her home. Edit: English issues.	Personally, I'd reply with something something to the effect of this is a matter to be resolved between you and your parents. On a side bar, stop transporting drunk underage children in your car who are not yours. If you want to be a "cool person looking out for today's youth" pay for a cab.	1
Which was your worst "I knew I shouldn't have done this" moment?	I killed a neighbors swan and did a shit on it. Turns out they were planning on plumping it up and giving it to us as gift. We laugh about it now.	When I was around 12 I noticed that nail polish remover felt cold and kind of nice as it evaporated from my fingers. So I decided to put some on my vagina. Edit: In response to a post asking "What happened?" I believe that the acetone in the nail polish remover burned (dissolved?) several layers of the sensitive skin/ mucous membranes around my adolescent genitals. But please, feel free to lay some education on me.	0
What do people brag about that is not worth bragging about?	The size or utility of their genitalia. It's like bragging about how tall you are, or how long your nose is. Your skill and determination contributed literally nothing to making this happen.	When they refer to a sports team as "we" when they're not on the team "Hey Jim, was watching the game last night, did you see when *we* totally kicked the other teams ass?" "Yeah, I knew the championship was going to be a tough game, but I knew *we* would pull through" It's not your accomplishment! Want to watch it? fine. Want to talk about it? fine. Referring to the teams accomplishments like you were somehow involved? Go fuck yourself	1
What is the stupidest thing on social media?	The sort of people who overshare and their house ends up getting robbed because they revealed they were going on vacation.	When is the last time a successful friend has posted a motivational quote on their wall? The successful people I know DON'T use social media.	1
Has anyone here ever used Martial arts in a street fight or in self defense? If so what happened?	My buddy got in a bar fight one time. I was trained in taekwondo and Kung fu but never used them at the time. I got in the middle of the fight to try to break it up. I got punched in the head. This made me angry so I back-kicked the dude in the chest... Knocking him down. His friends helped him up and they left. Most of the people at the bar thought it was awesome but a few thought it was "low" of me to kick the dude when he was merely throwing punches.	I pulled out my dick and came in the guys eye, blinding him before he could react. I then proceeded to suck the semen out of his iris and spit it down his asshole at a velocity that managed to pierce his colon	1
What's your "Don't judge me" thing?	Responding to my cats' meows with questions, which prompts more meows. They seem to enjoy it as much as I do.	I talk in 3rd person sometimes. It started in highschool and a way to irritate a teacher and it continues into my mid twenties	1
If you could keep ANY animal as a pet legally, what animal would you choose and why?	All of them. I believe it's possible, after generations of proper human exposure, to create a peaceful, and possibly even a loving, relationship with any and all animals.	I want to have a gang of meerkats that follow me around and all look towards me when something happens.	0
What’s something that you memorized as a kid and will stick in your brain forever?	When I was 5 my mum took me to town and asked me to remind her that she needed 9 buttons. I remembered and reminded her and continued to remind her every time she went to town until I realised she didn’t need to get them every time. It became a bit of a joke as I got older, but I’ll never forget those 9 buttons.	At Obama’s inauguration my school had an assembly and my class had to memorize a rap song about the inauguration. We had like half an hour to memorize the whole thing, but 11 years later I can still do it word for word.	1
Doctors of reddit, what patient made you scream "how is this even possible..."?	Once in the middle of a surgery an eleven year old boys intestines where all over his abdomen going in every which way	MD student. Saw a guy come in post- motorcycle crash, foot hanging off his leg at the ankle by just a piece of skin. Imagine a mozzarella stick once you pull it apart. Went up to the OR immediately for a replantation. Ended up saving his foot	0
What is the least attractive thing that people commonly wear?	Skinny Jeans. Seriously, It's one fad that I wish never came back into style. I have yet to see anyone that looks BETTER in them than regular jeans...and don't even get me started on males that wear them!!!	It's only common in the work place but an ill fitted suit. You can spend an arm and leg on a suit but if it doesn't fit you well you have wasted your money.	0
What's the smallest thing that makes you irrationally angry?	When I try to lean my backpack upright against a wall, but it falls over, so I spin it around and try again, and it still falls over.	When people post the same question over and over again on Reddit and then Reddit just responds with the same cliche bullshit about how they hate when their headphones get caught on doorknobs and other shit that they probably don't actually get that upset about but exaggeration is hilarious, right?	1
Today I was blown away by a reserved, average guy in my poetry class who answered a question my professor could not. Suddenly I was imagining unspeakably naughty things about this unassuming gentleman. What are your unusual turn-ons, nerdy or otherwise?	I sit next to a dude in my maths class who is ALWAYS put together--every button and crease where it should be, and also has the most perfect handwriting I've ever seen. For some reason, that kind of attention to detail is really hot.	Rich / powerful women. The kind who get respect from other people. It feels somewhat hot making them be your little bitch. :)	1
Doctors/nurses of Reddit; What is the most obvious case of a patient 'faking it' you have ever seen?	In military i went to er complaining i couldnt breathe. They said i was imagining it and made me leave. That night i suffered from 2 collapsed lungs and flatlined. They were in process of pronouncing me deceased when my heartbeat came back. Spent 2 weeks in a coma and then got a medical discharge. I now suffer from extreme dry pleurisy for the last 9 years. Still fighting to get benefits. Keep getting denied	I work as a nurse in the ER. A woman with a shaved head came in telling us she had leukemia was In serious pain. She kept saying that she needed painkillers. There were no records indicating she even had cancer and when we did a complete blood count it showed that she was in fact healthy. After that we discharged her and notified police. A few weeks later I saw her on my states most wanted list for using ID fraud at pharmacies in 20 different counties.... oxy is one hell of a drug.	0
People of reddit, what is something people do that you don't understand?	I don't understand why people continue to date someone that is obviously making them miserable and has been for a long time.	Religion. How do you intentionally choose to bury your head in the sand about all other explanations for the world around you, despite available evidence, and choose just one fairy tale to believe?	1
What are your deepest secrets that you would like to share before you die?	I do not care about social justice. I do not care about refugees, Muslims, blacks, or whatever "issue" is at hand. I've been pretending to care to get really easy sex. There are always those girls who care about every issue in our school. Some of them are hot, some have hot friends, and some of their friends will eat up any of this shit you throw at them. I feel bad at times but at the same time I really don't care. I'm in my last year of school and its just getting easier. Also I voted for Trump, but told everyone I know I voted for Hillary.	Two of my good friends, one guy and one girl, were both repeatedly raped as children by the pastors of their churches. Same state, different churches. The girl's pastor was her father. No one else knows. A former co-worker I'd known for about half an hour told me about an inoperable tumor on her spine that keeps her in constant pain so she's always doped up on pain meds. It also causes incontinence, so she wets the bed almost every night. I was born with one of those faces that says, "please, tell me something incredibly personal I have no idea how to appropriately respond to." It's an uncomfortable honor.	0
What's one thing you wish other people would understand about you?	If you don't like me at my worst then you are not gonna be around for the best of me	I might sound like I don't care about what you're saying, but I do care. Sometimes I just don't know how to respond in a way that will satisfy you.	0
Which actor is most like their character in real life?	Jeff Goldblum only plays Jeff Goldblum. The jazzy voice, the wit, the playful banter. And honestly, I just read Jurassic Park for the 9th time a few weeks ago, he was a perfect Dr. Malcolm.	Nick Offerman is basically Ron Swanson. It would honestly cheapen it a bit for me if he wasn't. Edit: Thanks for the info, guys! I didn't know much of this.	1
What is the most difficult "would you rather" question you know?	Would you rather orgasm every time you hear the Wilhelm Scream or do the Wilhelm Scream every time you orgasm	Would you rather have to watch you parents have sex every day to completion. Or join them once to make it stop?	1
What are some things that don't hold up as you get older?	Sitcoms. Friends for instance. Recently tried to rewatch it and the homophobia and the fatshaming put me way way off.	Childlike wonder. When my brothers and I were childeren we would fantasise about having special powers, being magical creatures at sea, being moles, ... Our house and backyard were a world on its own. Now it kinda died. Fortunately I discovered D&D so not all is lost.	0
[Serious] Men of Reddit who have been raped by women, what happened, did you tell anyone, and did they take you seriously?	She didn’t cause physical harm, just took advantage of my drunkedness, I was kinda disappointed by it and we don’t keep in contact but no big deal.	I've posted this a few times, here it is again. Long story short: Late night after the bars in college, I go home and passed out, girl knocks on my door and asks if I'm home, we know her so my roommate says yeah and lets her in. She goes straight to my room where somehow, while I lay lifeless passed out drunk, she gets me hard and starts riding me. My roommate opens my door and flips on the light and asks if she even put a condom on me first, she says no, and he kicks her out. I am informed of all this in the morning. Scary the idea that if the roles were reversed, it'd be a severely different story but I personally didn't really care nor did anyone else when I told them. Every single response was "that's awesome easiest lay of your life"	0
Dentists of Reddit, what is the most disgusting thing you have found in someone's mouth while cleaning their teeth?	I havent found anything particulary weird, except for the usual super-loose teeth, pussing abscesses and big blocks of calculus. Patients are often ashamed of their oral health if they havent been to a dentist in a ling time. I usually calm them by saying that Ive seen much worse. But sometimes it really is among the worst I have seen (or smelled), and I have a hard time keeping a straight face. Those are the patients I feel bad for, but also whose oral health I have a good opportunity to improve and to help them gain a new quality of life.	Typical ask reddit thread. "I'm not a [profession relevant to the thread] but I want people to listen to me"	1
[NSFW] Parents of reddit, what made you realize your child was no longer an innocent kid?	My best friend's son is 5 1/2 right now and one day she walked into their living room to find him completely naked, standing at attention and sticking his little man parts into the couch cushion, then thrusting out, and then thrusting them back in. She asked him what he was doing and he said "This is how I relax sometimes." He isn't allowed to relax like that anymore.	My mom found out when a man called the house and said, "Are you Xardrix's mom? Have your son quit fucking my wife." and hung up.	1
What is your favorite instance of the bad guy winning?	The Europeans did awful things to the natives of America, albeit assisted by germ warfare without their knowledge (at first). Horrible crimes were committed from Columbus to the present day, but dammit if I don't love being an American and living in a country with tons of beautiful blood-stained land.	The Siamese cats in Lady and The Tramp. It's my favorite because it made me so mad as a kid that they got away with it, and I think they're really the only Disney 'villains' who did. But it was just ingenious how those racist trope bastards played it all out. In the book, they're not such assholes, and feel remorse for playing their pranks and 'jokes'. ETA: Totally forgot about The Queen of Hearts and the Pleasure Island villains in Pinocchio. They also got away with it.	0
Reddit, have you ever tried something with the intention of proving it wrong but ended up liking it?	D&D. So you guys just sit around and tell stories to each other and justify it by adding video game mechanics? Now a dice probability generator sits on my desktop.	To any girl I've been with: BUTTSEX. If you do it right the first time, they're gonna like it when the mood strikes.	1
Parents of ugly children, when did you finally admit it to yourself and how has it impacted you?	I always wanted to believe my son would be perfect... but then again I look like a California raisin so I don't know what was I supposed to expect.	No parents see their children as ugly. Source: My sister thought my niece was the most beautiful baby alive and wanted to put her forward as a baby model. Only now when we look back she realised she was pretty odd looking and pulled some strange expressions. Sort of looked like a worried old man.	1
How often do you upvote posts?	Almost never. I rarely look at anything past page 2 anyway, so it's not like upvoting it is going to move it much.	When I see something I that makes me laugh, or something that makes me say “yeah, I agree with that”	0
Reddit, what "impossible coincidence" stories do you know?	After getting my MD degree, I left England to do my internship at University Hospital in Salt Lake City as a cardiologist. Couple years later my twin sister is telling me about her long distance relationship with a guy in Salt Lake City. Turns out he has a heart condition and was examined by a cardiologist. In Salt Lake City. At University Hospital. By me.	The most incredible coincidence I have ever witnessed happened a few weeks ago. My step-sister has just moved back to Australia after living abroad for around 12 years. She's getting reacquainted with friends, getting phone numbers, etc. Myself and my mum are spending a night at the house of one of my mum's friends. It's worth noting this friend of my mothers has never met my step-sister at all, no contact, etc. We end up getting a call from my step-sister, on the landline. There is no possible way she could know this number. It turns out she misheard one of her friends numbers, which somehow ended up with her calling us, on the one day that we spend at my mum's friends place. Extremely freaky.	0
What is the weirdest thing you have ever agreed to?	I agreed with a friend that if I died young she could claim I had painted all her artwork, as she was sure nothing is ever popular until the artist is dead. That way she could see people appreciating her work, even if she wasn't taking credit for it.	I once agreed to beat a cow to death in a rice field using only two small porcelain figurines. The police report said it may be the very first case ever of a nick nack patty wack.	1
Reddit, what are some college majors that should definitely be avoided?	If you're a journalism major, getting involved in student publications/media is way more important than classes. Journalists aren't hired based off of their degree, but how well acclimated they are to newsrooms, deadlines, etc. You can't learn the trade in the classroom, only in the field. Classes are to just help you refine your skills and the little things EDIT: I didn't mean to imply that classes are useless. The degree itself pretty much is, but most of my professors are accomplished/active journalists so they have so much to teach students that really is invaluable. The classes do matter to help you in the field.	Unless you are one of the idle rich who is inheriting enough money to last you more than a life time, avoid all the humanities. Those majors were specifically created in a vain attempt to try to make idle rich (nobility) better people. Sometimes it works. If you are idle rich, I would definitely encourage a degree in the humanities.	1
[Serious]Girls, what's the worst thing a guy can do in sex?	playing with the boobs too much gives the impression that you're about as experienced as the average sixth grader. boobs are by and large not erogenous at all. i am bored. also don't leave hickies, we're not in sixth grade anymore and I have a fucking job to go to tomorrow. EDIT: jesus shit ok maybe I undershot the age a bit. the point is that motorboating me for twenty minutes is going to make me think you've never seen actual live tits before, which is not a good look for you. EDIT2: if my last edit did not make it clear, I am not talking about nipples, just the rest of the boob, goddamn get out of my inbox with your tales of nipple play	Starfishing. I dated a guy who just lay there like a corpse while I was on top. I'm talking not moving, eyes closed, no facial expression. Thought I'd killed him. Edit: and when I suggested we change positions (it's hard to keep going when your partner looks like they're napping), he opened one eye, said "nah, I'm good," and went back into sexy, sexy REM sleep.	0
What is the most ridiculous thing you have ever seen a tourist get upset over?	Here in California, we hear stupid shit all the time. My favorite is when during the summer, people go to San Francisco in shorts and then bitch about how cold it is. Do some research people!	I can't speak for other tourists, but I'm super enraged by places where you have to pay for bottled water because there are no public water fountains, and where you have to pay to use the bathroom. In Italy, where I was a paying customer at numerous restaurants and repeatedly asked for tap water to go with my meal, almost all the servers everywhere said "you have to buy bottled water, we don't serve tap". What the fuck do you dipshits drink and cook with? Plus maybe I don't like the idea of adding to the Pacific or Atlantic trash gyres when I don't have to. Having to pay to go to the bathroom makes me want to fling piss and shit **everywhere**. Hope your Euro was worth it, fuckers. Say whatever you want about the US; here we drink, piss, and shit for free.	1
Whats your bad college roommate story?	He would make a big pot of mac n cheese and proceed to eat 5 spoonfuls out of the pot and then leave it on the table until it got moldy. He also didn't do his dishes	Minor complains, mostly. I'd prefer my roommates were more quiet. Also 2 of them don't clean their plates within the day, which is annoying. But overall they're fine and friendly.	1
Do you support the death penalty? why or why not?	I'd maybe tolerate it for serial killers and repeat offenders, where the case is almost 100% certain. But realistically, there's always a risk of someone innocent being wrongly sentenced to death and I wouldn't want to take that risk.	Yes, I support it. I get the whole, making the person suffer for the crime they committed... But I'd rather they just leave our Earth permanently. I don't feel like having my taxes go to these fuckers for the rest of their lives.	1
What is most annoying habit of your siblings?	My brother never flushes the toilet. And he puts our shower rug bunched up around the toilet when he takes a shit so his feet aren’t on the tile.	My sister (and brother in law) are mooches , in the mold of Janice from the Sopranos. It's not that they are poor, he's an attorney with a high tech career but f me they are constantly trying to get me or my modest parents to pay for stuff.	1
What are some if the dumbest things you thought as a kid?	when i was a child i thought being a liberal was a good idea. then i turned 9 and realized how fucking stupid their ideology is :) *TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP!!*	My dad told me that the rumble strip on the side of the highway that makes noise when you drive over it was to help blind people stay on the road. Took me longer than I'd like to admit to figure that one out.	0
Reddit, what's the toughest riddle you know?	How do you fit 10 horses into 9 stables? You can't put more than one into a stable, one isn't pregnant or on a roof, and you can't build another stable for another one.	This one only really works when spoken. You're a bus driver. At the first stop you pick up 2 women and 3 men. And the second stop, a man and a woman get off and a man gets one. At the third stop, all the remaining men from the first stop get off and three women get on. At the fourth stop 2 men get on. What is the name of the bus driver?	0
What do people do that you hate, but you actually do yourself?	Whine about minor things, it really gets me going. But here I am having a cold and oh my ...	Being overly pervy toward women. Sitting here at my computer, I know it's wrong and I wish all guys would be respectful toward them, but when it's hot out and the beautiful women come out of the woodwork in their sundresses or short-shorts with crop tops, I'm always leering, catcalling, and/or saying things like "Very nice!" or " *That's* what I like." I'm a weak, weak man.	1
Amazon workers of reddit: Amazon is on record as being dehumanizing to work for and for treating employees very poorly, what are some examples of this?	I had a coworker who had frequent seizures on the job, my entire department and the safety team were decently trained for helping her when she had the seizures. But she actually got promoted to a lead at an out of state Amazon. She literally dropped everything and moved across the country to be a lead at a different fulfillment center. They immediately fired her when she had her first seizure and refused to help her at all. It was pretty heartbreaking when I found out about it.	Lol.. these stories.. jeezus, its a freaking job, that pays pretty damn well.. YOU ARE THERE TO WORK, NOT SOCIALIZE.. bunch of undisciplined, lazy mothers.. i wanna get paid to go spend time socializing, how dare they expect me to meet some sort of productivity standards	1
What was your "dodged a bullet" moment?	A mentally(disabled/ill) girl was hitting on me when I was in year 2 and she was like 3 years older than me no offence to her but she was ugly as shit and super creepy just glad she left that year	Almost got my 17 year old girlfriend pregnant when I was 16. We both wanted it. In hindsight that would have been a *massive fucking mistake*.	0
What is the most brilliant marketing strategy you've ever seen?	Well, the GOP managed to convince the working class that supporting tax cuts for the rich and the destruction of worker protections was their better option...	Apple's original iPod is hard to beat. When they originally created it, most portable audio devices were black. By making it white, it stood out completely. Remember the commercials? They were just solid colors of dancing people with the white iPod. GoPro has also been a marketing force.	0
Garbage men and people who work at dumps, have you ever found anything cool or expensive?	The best thing about being a garbage man was finding the coupons on the side of Casey's pizza boxes. Collect 10 of them and you had a free pizza~ Also, found a working Nintendo with a few games, books of C.D's, used condoms etc.	Not too long ago, I found a working hard drive on the dump, here near Newport, in the south of Wales. Guess what, it contained about 7,500 bitcoins!	1
Adults who chose not to have children and are the past the age to have them, what is your life like?	This question is a little like asking someone how they feel about not taking a trip to the moon. I'm basing my answer on assumptions and best guesses.theres a myriad of experiences an nuances that simply wouldn't register to an onlooker.	Not actually an adult in that position but my "parents" are. They decided not to have kids since they felt it wasn't fair to bring more beings into this world when there are too many already here that need help. So they regularly foster teenagers (which they did for me) to help those that are lost and forgotten, transition into the real world. I am eternally grateful for their decision.	0
Reddit: what's your "fuck HOA's" story?	It was toward the end of my first year of high school in Sweden. I'd seen a girl who changed her hair colour every 2 months or so and I was interested. She was very cute and one day I just started talking to her. Turns out she was vietnamese and that her name was Hoa, we fucked three times.	Think I've told this one before but its just too good. One year HOA decided to force everyone to put these huge candy canes made of PVC pipe in their yards lining the street for Christmas. Some of the Jewish neighbors weren't cool with that and complained. How did the HOA respond? Replacing their red candy canes with blue ones...	0
What were ancient Samurai sword fights like? Did they have long drawn out fights like in movies or did it usually end in one or 2 swings?	I believe that the Samurai focused their talents on the quick draw fighting techniques. This means that their goal was to draw their sword and make a deadly strike as fast as possible.	They were extremely fast. Every sword fight, no matter the style or sword, is. Clashing and clanging look great on screen for movies, but aren't even close to realistic. Waving a piece of metal around with the force necessary to kill/maim a person tires you out very fast, so pitched battles A) never lasted long and B) were meleés where indiviual combat really wasn't possible. For the utlimate example, get a baseball bat and a heavy punching bag. Swing the bat at the bag, as fast as you can for as long as you can. If you can keep your speed up for more than 5 minutes, you are a superhuman and should be trying to extract Excaliber from it's stony home.	0
I work at Arby's. Today, someone tried to steal a urinal. What's the weirdest thing that's happened at your job?	I used to work at an advertising agency. I came in on a Saturday using my key and passcode. Building was empty except for the melodious sounds of pornography floating from one of the vice president's offices. It was definitely a recording of people having sex. I feebly called out "Hello?" and the porn ceased. I then heard two male voices talking rapidly and one of them goes "Who's there?" I immediately fled, locking the door behind me.	One of my friends (co-worker) decided that he wanted to fool around in the office. So he takes off his shorts, and I take off my skirt. Then the boss walks in, and he starts disrobing. He threatens allegations if he's not involved in the threesome. We take off his slacks. It was a good time. But more admin got involved, all threatening to call us out and report us to HR. Before long, the entire office was sextasticking in my lil cubby.	1
In honour of Move-In Day, RAs of Reddit, what’s the worst parent/student separation you’ve seen?	Mom thought she would be able to live with her daughter in the dorms. Upon being told that wasn't possible, she withdrew the daughter, and they both went back home.	And yet when my son went in the service it was 'drop him off at the recruiting office and say goodbye'	1
What's your greatest gaming memory?	well maybe my best gaming memory was back in 2010, I rember i snuck down to my fathers bedroom and i took his laptop from his bed, then to sneak up to my room again and play cod 4, back at dat time i was a god in cod 4 it was my favorite game and still is to this day, but i can't really enjoy it as much as i did back then, idk why but if someone feel like me please let me know.	It's gotta be those multilayer war stories. You know that one game of Halo 3 where you carried the team against all odds? Or fighting off the entire enemy team in Search and Destroy CoD, using all your ammo and then finally knifing the last guy while your team cheers. Definitely those organic moments that no one could script.	0
What is a fun, unconventional first date idea?	You take her to the finest restaurant in town where you eat only the best food freshly prepared by an award-winning chef. You drink...fine wines. Then you take her to your hotel, best hotel in town mind, you carry her up to your room where there are Belgian chocolates, more fine wines, quality champagne on ice, satin sheets on the bed..maybe a poem on the pillow..and a single red rose. Then slowly, gently, you undress her. But keep your own clothes on because no one wants to see a man in the nude.	My first year psych prof once told me that the best first unconventional date is a roller coaster ride. Being high up in the rollercoaster apparently puts both you guys hormones out of wack and by the time you finishing riding 5-6 rides, you'll definitely get laid.	0
Reddit, I bought a car from my sister for $600, she spent my money, and then sold the car to her roommates. What should I do?	Post on craigslist that the is looking to fulfill a rape fantasy giving her address and her schedule and where a key to her place can be found and that the safe word is "butterscotch".	>Since she is my sister, I thought I could trust her My sister also screwed me over for $600. I vote for a small claims case to get your money back. Sister or not, you don't lie down when someone tries to screw you over.	0
Redditors, what's one thing people would never know about you just by looking at you?	That I have anxiety. I look like a lean-back, cool person... I usually don't *look* stressed out, even when I am... until I start talking	That I am extremely "dark and twisty." On the inside. I'm a blonde haired green eyed conservatively dressing middle class suburban woman. You'd think that I would be all Nicholas Sparks and Hallmark movies. I love horror stories and movies, true crime (the worse the better) shows like CSI and Criminal Minds. Almost everything that I have read in the past year has been some sort of murder mystery. I also love disaster documentaries and books about disasters.	1
Redditors who never dated until their mid to late 20s, how did you finally end up meeting your significant other?	I set out to gain confidence by sleeping with big girls on tinder. Works. Zero downside. Then I started sleeping with a coworker I didn't particularly like. That extremely disfunctional arrangement somehow gained traction and we've been together over a year. She's my best friend and closest ally and I hope to spend a lot more time with her.	We met in college and courted each other for two years before actually getting together due to fear of the unknown. Eventually he asked, “are you my girlfriend?” In complete fear I replied, “...I don’t know.” “Do you want to be?” He said. “Yes!” I was rather eager. Two years later he proposed exactly the same way. “Are you my wife?” My yes was more eager than the last.	0
What's your 'worst neighbor ever' story?	oh dear god...I live in an apartment and next us is like 8 black people, including about like 3 kids, and when I was going downstairs (cause I live in the 3rd floor) I saw the fire extinguisher in front of our neighbors door and near the end of the hallway, I noticed some broken glass and just yesterday, I notice a paper that's says something like "we have replaced a lot of the fire extinguishers cause they keep getting missing, if you have noticed anything suspicious, please call *numbers*" and I'm too lazy to report about this...so yeah	My friends upstairs neighbor has a dog, he never takes for a walk or out for a poop. So the dog just shits on the balcony and when it dries he shovles off the balcony onto the cars below. Then throws water on it to clean it up and the shit water drips down onto her balcony. She has called the landlord, the city, the maintenance company. No one will do anything about it. We have shouted at him while doing it and he stops for a minute but continues when we are gone. If you knock on his door, he won't answer.	0
What small seemingly insignificant thing have you lost that just crushed your world?	In pokemon, I lost my exp. share. When you lose that you basically just have to restart your game, because leveling by switching pokemon out just takes too long	I had a locket with a picture of my Mom holding me right after I was born. y Mom wasn't in my life for many years and that was the only picture I had of her. One day I'm playing with my Dad's SO's kids (who I hated) and her son rips my locket off my neck and throws it into a bayou by where I lived. I freaked out and he runs back to my house laughing. I searched and searched for that locket but I never found it in the muddy water. When I got back to my house I got in trouble for getting dirty and proceeded to freak the fuck out and tried to hurt the kid who threw my locket. More trouble. Bastards.	0
What was a first time experience that was also a last time for you?	weed did it once but I'm never doing it again. Hate the people, hate the culture, and hate the stuff. Not worth it, and VERY overrated.	Trying to impress my crush with drinking. She was more disgusted than impressed and I was feeling worse than I imagined. All of my butterflies flew out over the toilet.	0
What was your biggest fuckup in your life?	I've never fucked up. Any deviation from the path I took would have led me somewhere else and I'm happy as a clam to be where I am now.	Having a three year long affair with a guy in University. He had a girlfriend throughout the whole ordeal, who had no idea. The guilt of it all hit when I attended their wedding and watched them exchange vows. Oh by the way, I'm a dude.	0
What was the absolutely worst customer service experience you have ever had?	Health insurance. Having to explain to the "first line" of personnel who appear to be there simply to wear you down, what a procedure is, what the codes mean, and why something is, in fact, covered by my insurance. My doctor's office actually provided me all the information knowing that my insurance was denying the claim assuming that I would probably just pay it. It took several phone calls but they did pay the claim. It was extremely frustrating, though, especially when you are sick and having to fight for your insurance to do their job.	We had a dude come in, shit the fuck out of his pants, went into the mens handicap stall and ditched his undies. They were found later by an employee in the corner of the stall, filled to the brim with poo. My friend worked inventory at the time and told me to come back and see it. It was the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. The man apparently tried to clean up some of the spillage with his hands, and got his shitbutter all in the grout of the floor. It looked like someone went mud wrestling. They looked back at the camera feed, and the dude actually had the nerve to go out and buy a phone with his butterfingers touching everything. He sat down and did a 20 min activation etc. free balling with what I can only imagine as a full on chocolate ass.	1
“The customer is always right” is a major fallacy in the customer service industry. What’s a fallacy in you industry?	"I fixed it with a reboot" No you didn't. You removed the symptom. The root cause is still there and nothing has been 'fixed'.	Nurse here. They started a " customer is always right" policy where I worked, having patients fill out a satisfaction form after their visit. We even had a script (attached to our name badge) that we were supposed to read to the patients when they arrived, that we were mainly there to make their visit more pleasant. So if a patient wanted juice but they were NPO (nothing to eat/drink) because they had surgery in the morning or it was contraindicated because of their diagnosis, they could give a negative review which would give the staff demerits. That was one of the last straws before I quit.	0
What is the most computer illiterate thing you've witnessed?	We hired a guy for software testing. We gave him a word document that was basically text and screenshots about the application he was supposed to test. I left him alone for 30 minutes. He finally came to me and told me that he could not log into the application. I asked him what the error was, and he said he could not get the login prompt to accept any text. Well, he did not have the application up. He only had the word document up. He was trying to log into a screenshot of the application. I couldn't help but laugh my ass off. TLDR: New employee was trying to log into a screenshot.	I worked for wireless internet tech support...got a call guys asked "what's the cup holder for that comes out of the computer thing?" *facepalm*	1
What did you do in the 80's for fun?	First rule of the 80's club is you do not talk about the 80's club. (man you people spilling secrets, 80's was quite a embarrassing time, lets not talk about our shame)	I read books, I learned to program on my dad's Commodore 64, I watched Friday Night Videos because we were too poor to have MTV, I listened to the radio and I made mix tapes. That about covers it.	0
What is a cliché movie scene that you witnessed in real life?	After flying into Mesa, AZ I noticed an entire family welcoming home their daughter/sister from college. They had a banner and everything. The second she walked out from the terminal her younger sister (I'm assuming) sprinted at her and jumped up for a hug and absolutely fucking mauled her. They both hit the floor with a thud. I shared some hysterical laughs with an enterprise worker.	So my bestfriend Autumn is crazy and its okay because I still love her and all her weirdness but I was in my class just minding ny own buisness and she sneaks into my class goes under the table and sits in the chair infront of me but im on my phone so i dont notice shes their i think to myself ohh i kinda miss Autumn i wonder where she is and i look up and bam shes right there and then she scared me because i was in shock that she just fuckin magically teleported infront of me basically	1
What is your shitty landlord story?	They wanted to evict us when they discovered we were *legally* growing marijuana in the basement. We could have fought it but we decided to get out that dump anyway.	When I was living with an ex up in Massachusetts my landlord was this 90 year old man named Fred, who didn't care much about tenant laws. MA is one of those states that has some pretty strong laws, like one where you have to give a certain amount of notice to the tenants before showing their apartment to potential buyers. Fred didn't give a fuck, and would bring people over with no notice, and expect me to let them into my apartment when I was chilling on a saturday afternoon. Once he came by, opened the door to my apartment and brought some people by, while my gf and I were having sex in the living room. Not cool Fred.	0
What is your worst/strangest OK Cupid experience?	First date: fun, spontaneous trip one evening! Second date: show up, ask for gate code, no response; wait for a while, still no response to calls or texts; chalk it up as an online dating flake A few weeks later: see that my date has been committed to a mental health facility halfway across the country after a suicide attempt Luckily, everything seems positive and is going well for both of us, despite never communicating again!	All of this makes me want to reactivate my OKC account - I could really use the laughter. Unfortunately it's a catch-22, though - I want the lolz because I'm deeply depressive, and because I'm deeply depressive I can't really find it in myself to go on dates. FML =/	1
What kind of person are you in your group of friends, and what is the struggle of it?	I'm the organizer, everyone comes up with ideas to do stuff and I'm supposed to plan it out, invite people and whatnot with *zero* help and it's annoying as fuck. If I don't organize anything, nothing will happen. For once, I'd like to kick back while someone else does all the work.	The cutest one whose into sex. Think Kaylee from firefly. It's great. Everyone loves me, and wants good things for me. Cons are dealing with people who have crushes.	1
People who have submitted /r/niceguys, /r/creepyPMs, etc. Did the person reach back out after seeing it on Reddit? If so, how did it go?	its funny because all of the top comments are people complaining about people taking up the top comments with irrelevant comments. comments.	Since no one else has actually answered the question, I will. I posted a really creepy death threat I received on my previous Reddit account, and the person who sent it ended up cyber stalking me to the point they found out my real name and another social media profile of mine. Then proceeded to post our conversation in another subreddit and claim that we met up, fucked, and I told him afterwards that I was engaged, which was bullshit. Never met this person in my life. So I reported and blocked the account, only to find out there were at least three other accounts involved and the person just kept making more accounts to harass me. So I deleted my account, started over, and here I am. TL;DR: posted in r/creepyPMs and gained a cyber stalker	0
Wedding photographers of Reddit: can you tell if a couple is going to last or not? If so, how?	I was at this wedding one time, and I knew things wouldn't go down so well once I heard the couple's most hated song play from the balcony. Pretty soon the host and his friends fired several crossbow bolts into all the guests before finishing off the man of honor with a sword stab. Then they killed his wife, and then his mother, and his pet dog. It was a mess.	I have an album of photos of my now ex-husband glaring at me. It'd be difficult for the photographer to have *not* noticed.	0
Guys, what pisses you off about other guys?	When you have a "friend" with whom you can have great conversation with 1:1, but the moment other people come around, their number one priority is to insult you in every way possible. Edit: I know what banter is. This isn't it.	Guys who wear brand name clothes with a large logo on their shirt. You fools are walking billboards, and you pay for it! They are a brand bitch. This also applies for women who do the same thing. They pay top dollar to be an advertisment for the company, I dont get it.	1
What do most people do incorrectly?	I see a lot of people who ride bikes and they don't downshift when coming to a stop. I see them struggling to gain momentum in high gears. It's funny to see.	Merging on to a busy highway from an on-ramp. Do not pull to the end of the on-ramp and then stop there to wait for an opening. Rather, stop at the beginning of the on-ramp and wait for a opening. This gives you the room needed to accelerate to highway speed before entering the lane. You can then also safely merge in to smaller gaps in traffic, instead of entering the lane at essentially 1mph and creating a dangerous situation. Edit: many of you are freaking out about the idea of stopping at all. Where I live, the ramps are small and there is often traffic which means you NEED to stop and wait for an opening. In that case it's better to allow yourself room to accelerate. Of course you don't stop at all if you can avoid it. So stop being a bunch of turds.	1
Reddit, how did you meet your current best friend?	In college we dated the same guy...simultaneously. Seven months into the relationship (for me; 9 for her) we both figured it, decided to meet to discuss it, realized we're both pretty awesome, confronted our bastard soon-to-be ex, and we've been best friends ever since.	Hmmm ive known my best friend for 6 years j....almost got me we will call him carlos , i met carlos at the same bonfire i received my name from, he was the guy that pulled me out of it, i owe him my life he has since then been an awsome friend.	1
Parents of gay/bi/lesbian/transgender kids, and had no idea that they were. What was the biggest "sign" that you missed?	Not a parent, but I'm bisexual and so is my little bro. I called it when he was 5. My parents were definitely in denial. He came out in March.	When my son complained about having sex with a girl. He didn't like it. For what it's worth, he missed that sign too. When he did have an experience with a guy, he KNEW! I am happy for him!	0
Redditors working at the film industry, what's your story working with Hollywood's famous actors/directors?	While I work at a major animated film studio, I don't see actors very often. Part of it is that, while we have a recording studio on campus, much of the recording is done elsewhere, and when they do record on campus, they're taken in the back way for privacy. That, and I'm usually off doing my job at my desk. My most intimate encounter was when James Hong politely asked me where the studio store was.	My first day on my first show, I was waiting in the loading dock of the Kodak with a radio to let the producers know when Aretha Franklin arrived. As I'm waiting there, I get a poke in the back and turn around to see Danny Devito. He says, "hey kid, let me use your cell phone." "Uh, sure thing, Mr. Devito," I say. I hear him make a call to someone who is either picking him up or dropping something off for him and then he gives me my phone back. "Is your battery dead?" I ask. "No, I just wanted to use yours," he says and walks away.	0
I just had my first can of root beer at 37 years old. What were you late to the party with?	If you're under 24, your entries aren't that impressive. "I'm 22, Just drank an RC Cola!" Of course waited that long, your mom always bought Pepsi.	I'd assumed from a very young age that I didn't like bananas. Then, when I was 21, I got a banana-eating roommate who opened up a whole new world for me. He started me on a five-month binge. Those were good times, actually; I became a banana man. Perhaps as much as 30% of the time that I was walking around I was carrying a bunch of bananas on my shoulder (every stroll around town took me by the grocery store and called for bananas). Sometimes strangers, especially highschoolers, would ask for one of my bananas. The pleasure was as much mine as theirs; it's a great thing to share what you love, and also to get a banana. I made friends over bananas. But now, friends, now I have no bananas at all. I've lost my way.	0
If you've ever gotten suspended or expelled from school, what'd you do?	Gave a bully an atomic wedgie... Then marched him outside, still suspended mid-air in said wedgie, to apologize to his victim before I let him down.	I served a 3 day out of school suspension for filling a girls locker full of dog food, dog biscuits and a few squeaky toys because she came to school bragging about sleeping with 2 of my cousins in the same weekend. She then proceeded to tell everyone at school that she was pregnant (that same week) and didn't know who the father was. She bragged that my family would take care of her and her unborn baby because of how wealthy they were (not true). So I filled her locker with kibble because I thought she was being a dog. Not my proudest moment.	0
People who browse reddit all day at work: what's it like working IT?	Boring as hell. There is only so much internet to browse before reposts stick out and karma whores get really annoying. Pay is meh. I do alot of work, don't get me wrong. However it is like a rollercoaster. nothing, nothing, nothing, TONS OF WORK, nothing, nothing... etc.	Ha how did you know?! I'm actually applying to go back to the main office because of brain melt, screw the extra commuting time.	1
Hey Reddit, what’s something you always get complimented on ?	Physically, my eyes. But personality, just the fact that I’m really chill and don’t care what people think of me. People can call me stupid or whatever, all they want, I don’t care. But when someone is saying things to my friends or family, that’s like the only time I actually get mad	In 2007, a coworker told me I was smart. (After I helped then solve a problem. ) In 2016, one of my kids friends told me I was smart. (I knew some interesting facts.) In 2018, during my annual review, my boss told me I was smart. This constant flow of compliments is going to go to my head if it doesn't stop soon.	0
What is a psychological manipulative technique that we should know about?	When verbally giving someone a list of options to choose from they are most likely to remember/choose the first and last options so make sure the choices you want them to pick are either first or last.	when someone holds something you want and ask you for a favor or ask for something , you have to do it or fight him and cut ties with him and might lose your shit.	1
Dentists of reddit, what are some common myths about dental care and/or dental products?	I'm a dentist. When buying your products, look at the active ingredients. If the whitening toothpaste has the same ingredients to the generic toothpaste beside it, they probably don't do anything different.	Not a dentist but I have heard that the type of tooth paste matters much just don't get ones with ultramarines or microbeads as the plastics in the paste can scratch your enamel and are bad for the environment.	1
What is the lowest point you’ve reached in your life? How did you get there? Where are you now?	I have OCD and before I accepted it and bought into treatment would get a lot of intrusive thoughts. My cousin killed himself and along with being depressed my intrusive thoughts were of the topic of suicide. After about a week that was essentially one long panic attack, my wife drove me to the hospital and told me to check myself in or else she would report me as a danger to myself. At the time, that was the worst day of my life. Looking back now with 20/20 hindsight and a far healthier perspective, it was probably the best day.	I’m currently crying because Starbucks we’re out of pumpkin spice latte today and I’d been planning on treating myself for two weeks, so probably this tbh.	1
What is the most unethical thing you did in a videogame?	In a game that I had when I was a kid there was a weird mole that could talk and he said something like "don't hit me please". When I tried to hit him he left an item that healed a lot of HP and he left afterwards. If you re-enter the room you find him again so I kept hitting him and re-entering the room because I wanted to fill my inventory with that item. The problem is that after hitting him too much he left saying that he will never come back because I was hurting him. When I tried to come back I found a girl who was sad because she wouldn't see him ever again and because they were friends. I felt bad	I sliced women in half with my claws in Prototype and when I heard their screams I got an erection. Sorry... Im glad nobody will see and upvote this.	1
At what moment did you realize that the person you'd been dating was utterly batshit-crazy?	Recently, I went on a date with a woman I'd met on Tinder. Throughout this outing at a local music scene, I felt rather repulsed but her personality and face and felt a little unsettled by her. Cut the date short and left after an hour. Not 10 minutes after the end of the date, I get a txt from her: "Had a great time. Wanna hang out again?" Didn't respond yet. Next text: "Ok, well, good luck then..." Continued to hold off on a response... 2 hrs later, another txt from her: "You're fucking ghosting me! You're such a child. Have a nice life!" Well, then...	When she came into my room and started going through my trash demanding to know what I ate without her	0
If you could take one unrealistic thing from the movies and put it into your life what would it be?	A happy ending. Or just a meet cute and I can take it from there. I want an insanely hot woman totally in love with me even though it doesn't make sense that she would.	To work in the kind of low end job I'm stuck in presently, but inexplicably be able to afford my own $3,500/mo apartment in NYC.	0
What single act caused you to instantly decide to end your relationship with someone?	When he threw me across a room. No coming back from that one. 7 months after we broke up he had knocked up some girl...their relationship didn't last the pregnancy, and his third child was born almost a year after that one. So I'm kind of glad I got off that train when I did.	Friend took a picture of me nude, sent it to crush then beat me up when I told him to fuck off.	1
What can you say to piss off the most people, while still being technically correct?	I'm getting more pissed off by the fact that most of what I'm reading is in fact, not technically correct. Edit: It's now 17 hours since I posted this comment and almost all the comments sorted by 'best' are technically correct. Good job reddit.	A trans person is still genetically the sex they were born as, and anything considering surgery/pronouns/etc is **asking everyone to pretend otherwise.** Edit: thank you all for attempting to debate me and tell me how wrong I am! You are welcome to present an XY male that, through gender reassignment surgery and lifestyle changes is now an XX female and I will completely admit defeat. Edit 2: made it to SRS! I'm clearly a misogynistic, bigoted piece of shit for saying a scientific fact!	1
What's the funniest reason you were kicked out of class?	9th grade health class I was kicked out after saying "NICE!" in a dead silent classroom after an animation of a penis becoming erect was shown. It was last period and I walked home so it worked out	This was in college. I meowed. We had a kid named Gary, and Gary the Snail from SpongeBob meows. I put one and one together and had the entire class meowing everytime someone said his name. Instructor didn't like this, said no more, but I'm an idiot and did it anyways. (This one is funny, more cringe) Also called the kid with brain damage (from am ATV accident) stupid by accident.. He said "yea I know, I'm not dumb" to the instructor, and I piped up and said "yea, you are"... Pretty sure Lucifer is keeping me alive because he doesn't want to be impeached :/	1
If I hit the lottery, I would go to work the next day and tell no one. I'd simply unbuckle my belt, hang my pants over my cube wall, pour myself a whiskey, and smoke a cigar until I was asked to leave. How would you quit your job if you didn't need the money?	Commercial Pilot Here for the world's worst airline (hint: our name is also a letter of the Greek Alphabet). I'd seriously consider packing a parachute and bailing at a low altitude.	I would calmly resign, put in my two weeks notice, do my best to make sure that I left a good work space for the person who would be doing my job afterward and leave without fuss. I would also wear a tuxedo for every day of those two weeks. I am a janitor.	0
My 7 year old daughter is getting teased a lot at school. Does anyone know any way of helping her/stopping it?	Tell her the truth: People won't always like her for being who she is. But she won't ever like herself if she acts like who she isn't. You'll always be there for her, no matter what. But she has to be the one to decide to fight for who she is. In the words of Dr. Seuss: Those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.	Give her a few jaw-dropping comebacks. Bully: "You're such a dyke/tomboy/lesbian etc." Her: "Your mom doesn't complain." Bully: "You're ugly." Her: "It's because your mom died." Bully: "Nobody likes you." Her: "My devil-worshiping pedophile mass-murdering uncle who does whatever I tell him to does." Bully: "I bet you pee standing up." Her: "Abortions are like pizza - at least, that's what it looks like." Seriously, if she's a tomboy, she should kick their pansy asses.	1
[NSFW] Redditors who unexpectedly found someone you know on a porn site, how did that go?	Laughed and sent to my friends. She's 'out of the game now' but it's weird knowing that mandingo had his way with a girl I know	Broke up with a girl when I was 20, she moved out west. 2 years later a buddy emails me a link with "omg, watch this" I open it, she's getting drilled with a facial ending... Her eyes were so glazed over (not with jizz) she was obviously on some hard drugs, made me feel really sad for her. Reached out to her and have remained friends ever since, she's happily married now with 2 kids, normal life, basically said she was broke at the time and was offered $100 and a g of coke to do it.	0
What's the most significant "you just fucked with the wrong person" moment you've witnessed or experienced?	"He never raised his voice. That was the worst thing... the fury of the Time Lord... and then we discovered why. Why this Doctor, who had fought with gods and demons, why he had run away from us and hidden. He was being kind..."	There's this old miserly looking man with a nickel who seems to just ride the subway all day. The nickel man only seems to have one purpose in his life, he sticks his hand out with a nickel on his palm, and he just points it at you. It's like he's asking you to look at his plain ol' nickel. He's like a reverse panhandler. One night, I was coming home drunk and saw the Nickel guy. He was doing his usual rounds, and he came to me. He stuck out his hand, and like usual you just let him be. But I was tipsy and I pulled the nickel out of his hand. Within seconds, he went from normal nickel guy to fucking crazy rip your face off yelling angry gorilla man. Till I put it back, and he became normal nickel guy again. I was mortified.	0
Girls, what one question you'd wish a guy would ask you to start a conversation?	I don't know why these type of questions are asked on this website. We all know that 99% of the people on here are single or way too ugly to ever be approached in public.	I think the Notorious BIG summed it up best... Ask you what yo interests are, who you be with, things that make you smile, what numbers to dial	0
Today my three year old daughter lifted up an overweight woman's shirt and asked, "Is there a baby in there?" What "holy shit you didn't just say that" moments have your kids provided for you?	When my grandma was in the hospital after a stroke, my mom and I went to visit. I was probably 3 or 4 at the time. When we went into the elevator, a man was already in there. One of his legs had been amputated at the knee, so he tucked his pants leg into his back pocket. I didn't know this though, so I asked, "How did you get your foot in your back pocket?" I don't remember his response, but he laughed about it.	You just let your kid run up to people and lift their shirts? Get control of your kids, teach them how to behave in public and stop being a lazy parent who laughs off bad behavior as "kids say the darndest things".	1
Bank employees of Reddit, what's the most absurd reason you've received for requesting a loan?	Kind of an anti-loan but customer comes in saying they wanted to discuss their car loan. In reality, once we started discussing the customer tossed the keys and said "It's yours, now stop calling" and left.	"I want a loan of 300,000 dollars to buy gas and sell it when the price is higher for profit". Just kidding. I'll virtual hug anyone who gets the reference.	1
Reddit, what became of your school's bully?	He's currently in jail for trying to rob our local bank ... In his work uniform ... With his name tag on.	They all are either pregnant and working dead end jobs. Or are just working dead end jobs and living at home. I'm excited for the 10 year reunion so I can show them how being popular in high school really meant nothing in the long run...after I show them pictures of my nice house and large paychecks. I love karma	1
What do you admire most about your father?	The guy is a damn zen master. I could tell him I punched a hole in his computer screens and deleted all his work files and he'd probably have fallen asleep by the time I got halfway through my explanation, and later use it as an excuse to go on a shopping spree at Costco, bless	He's a man who has cheated twice on my Mom and part of the reason I'm in a depressive rut right now I don't know how I can have admiration for him	1
11 years and 88 billion dollars later, Has the TSA prevented a single crime?	No but plenty of children we're molested in front of their parents and taught to unconditionally submit to authority despite better judgement. Its hard to put on a price on that sort of subservience.	To answer your question, yes. Lots of crimes. People attempting to bring weapons on a plane, drunken passengers assaulting flight attendants, contraband substances, all sorts of things that are illegal. Plus there's the deterrent factor - almost certainly, someone decided not to carry a gun on a plane because they were worried about going through screening. This is why the question you asked is not structured correctly. The right question is: "11 years later, has the TSA provided a value commensurate with the $88b invested in it?". *THAT* is a far more interesting question.	0
Long time teachers of reddit: How is teaching students now compared to 10, 20, and 30+ years ago?	With Children you need to keep them entertained, same goes for Teens but you need to let on that you know they are teens, with adults they are always questioning what you do. Oh i thought you were talking about age groups.	25 years of secondary education in the UK. I believe that the students have not changed, however the parents and community have. All students still have the potential to achieve but quite a few lack traditional parenting therefore they believe they can get away with anything.	0
What's the worst thing you ever told anyone that sounded good in your mind before you said it?	My sister had just been dumped by her fiance. She was devastated. We were at Denny's, where they use to eat a lot, and we were thinking about what to order. She said "You know what Bryan use to love?" meaning something he always ate there. Without skipping a beat I said "you?" She cried.	I told a fling that she gave great head. I thought it was a compliment; she, apparently, did not. We haven't spoken in over six years.	1
Why don’t old people just get old people roommates and party together rather than being alone?	You know those over 55 communities that have been popping up everywhere? My parents moved to one and it's basically a college dorm for older people. Drinking, drugs, sex, it's crazy.	Because they think the world revolves around them and that their friends should make the first move. It's like the worlds slowest and most passive aggressive stand off.	1
Have you ever been with someone who was terrible in bed? What made them so awful?	Yea had this one girl who as just terrible. She didn't even try to fight back like my other victims.	I once had sex with a girl who got on top of me and said "now keep quiet I have to concentrate" she then closed her eyes and mumbled encouraging things to herself. She also kept her shirt on the entire time. That was a few years ago, she's now in a loving relationship with a woman. So I guess I know what she was concentrating on.	0
What is something that nobody likes?	When your ear buds get yanked out of your ears because you snagged the wire on a fucking door knob.	Viruses, computer viruses, Comcast, religion/political arguments, malware, ads, mosquitoes, spiders, Google+, diseases, cancer, trolls, lag, power outages, flat tires, etc.	1
Adults of Reddit, what tips would you give to a young person as they enter "the real world"?	This is it. You won't wake up one day and feel different and more like an adult and be more responsible. You just gradually learn to deal with all the shit.	Credit cards are the devil and will ruin your financial life. Having one solely for emergency expenses is fine, but only use it as an absolute last resort. Oh, and buy a second back up vehicle. Nothing fancy, just a beater.	1
Reddit, I witnessed a lady leave her cart in the middle of a parking lot which started to roll into traffic while she rushed into her car to leave before it hit someone. What are some other cases of extreme laziness and inhumanity have you witnessed?	When I was a cook there was a woman who changed her two kids at the table before she left and left the diapers on the table.	When I was in the military I saw plenty of guys do shitty things just to get out of ordinary duty when we weren't deployed, but it was the poltroons who would try to get some sort of medical discharge to get out of deploying that upset me the most. Also saw a few guys go AWOL during basic training, fucking cowards.	1
What is the smallest lie you've told that's snowballed out of control?	3rd grade me told the class I could hula dance. The teachers thought it was fascinating and I kept the lie going for weeks. About a month later, I found myself teaching all of 2nd-5th grade how to hula dance. I did not know how to hula dance.	This one time I saw my sister and the neighbor making out by a fountain and assumed, wrongfully, that she wasn't into it. At a party a while later my cousin got raped and I pretended to have seen that it was that same guy. Anyway, she became a nurse and he went and fought in the war, and then they ultimately didn't get together after a lifetime of angsting. Worst crime though was that I kept the same nine-year-old haircut up until I was really old.	1
All you can eat buffet employees, what is the most disgusting display of gluttony you have witnessed?	3 if my friends and I got kicked out of a Chinese Buffet after we collectively at 49 plates of food. My 400lb friend scared a very small child by looking over, telling him to eat his veggies or he would end up like him, than proceeding to eat off his plate with just his face. We convinced a different friend to take the jello challenge. He shit his pants and vomited making a wild sprint to the bathroom. I have never laughed so hard in my life. E: Downvoted for telling a story related to the topic. Stay classy Reddit.	I worked at Olive Garden years ago, and they would occasionally run a never-ending pasta bowl deal (that also came with unlimited breadsticks and salad). There was a family that would always come in when the deal was on. Mom, dad, kids and grandma, all of them substantially fat. They would arrive at opening (11 am) and stay through dinner, 5 to 6 hours of eating. They were awful to serve, unpleasant and of course a lot of work for a relatively small bill. They all mixed packets of butter into their pasta sauce, grandma only drank diet coke mixed with sprite with lemons on the side. Anyway, one Saturday they were in there doing their thing and I guess Dad hit his limit and puked all over the table. Finally the manager saw his chance and banned them from ever coming back.	0
NSFW, Gone Wild posters who show their face, what do you do for a living? Has it ever been a problem at work?	I had a manager at work that had face pics of her sucking and fucking multiple dicks on fetlife. She was always kind of a cunt to me. One day when she was yelling at me, I showed her said pics on my phone, and she looked mortified. I told her to leave me alone and I'd leave her alone. She quit the next day.	I'm a marketing manager for a company I've been with for almost 8 years. I've posted a good 15 face photos over the years, alongside a ton of body-only posts. I'm on my third username, but - about 4 years ago one of my coworkers found me on reddit. Everyone else in the company got a look, including the owner. Alas, I'm still here, hah. I'm managing the fuck out of some marketing.	0
What is the worst secret that you accidentally revealed about someone else?	I was having surgery once and my wife, Skylar, found out that I had two mobile phones. I was high as a kite because of the drugs. It was super akward	While in 5th grade our teacher taught us how to look up sex offenders living nearby us on the internet. In the computer lab that day, a friend and I tried and discovered one of our classmates dads on the site. Long story short, we accidentally revealed that his father fucked the 16 year old baby sitter and that was the reason his parents got divorced.	0
What do people do that makes you cringe because of a skill, field of interest, hobby, or profession where you are an expert?	I'm not an expert by any means, but the casual disregard people display for the destructive power of firearms is often staggering. It's not that hard to comprehend. 1. A gun is always loaded 1. Don't point the muzzle at anything you are not willing to destroy 1. Keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to fire keeping those three things in mind would save so many lives/injuries.	Oh, you're an author? Have you read ::book they loved::? Odds are, the answer is no. As I've gotten better at writing, the number of books I've been reading has gone down, drastically. I know how the sausage is made, and I can identify bad writing much faster than other people can now.	1
What is the most violent thing you have ever done in your life?	I punched my car window as hard as I could over a girl. I was hoping to break it but I just broke my hand instead.	When I was eight I tricked an eleven year old into peeing on an electrified horse fence because he had humiliated me in front of a huge group of people. Then I beat him with a stick. Looking at my dirty hands as I walked away, I realized that revenge is terrible path to walk, and that I would never again seek it out. ( I had a really intense inner dialogue as an eight year old, I was reading way over level at the time)	1
What genre of music has the worst fanbase?	I'm a huge edm fan, but some people are so stuck up and cynical about it all. I'm not a fan but who cares if someone likes Slushii or Marshmello over Don Diablo or kshmr. People get so butthurt.	Metal. Why do you need to dress up in black with skulls, dragons etc just because you like a certain type of music?	1
What was the scariest encounter you have ever had?	When I was 17 me and my two neighbors were playing basketball in the alley behind my house. A van with 8 guys pulled up and started the process of trying to figure out our gang associations, basically asking "Whatcha be about?" and such. It was in Chicago during the 90's so even though we weren't in a gang we knew these guys weren't going to believe us and our eventual ass whoopin was about to begin. Just as my heart was about to bust out of my throat one of the guys in the van recognised one if my neighbors, they were schoolmates. Mutual greetings occurred and the situation was diffused. His friend also confirmed that the ass whoopin was indeed about to commence. We all laughed, ha ha, and they drove off. It took a few minutes for my asshole to unpucker.	I was made to climb into the back of a refrigerated meat truck behind Walmart. Instructed to lay down behind some boxes of sausage and wait to see what happened. Two guys came up to the truck and were using a box cutter to open the boxes between us. Not just by slicing open the tape, but stabbing it down first into the box where the seal is. I tried to stay still and not make myself known but that sense of terror as they approached closer and closer, stabbing each box, led me to get up. I just acted like I was confused or crazy, but we all knew what was going on. They called the police who just warned me to get out of their jurisdiction and left me to walk away	1
The post about commenting on the worst thing you've ever seen really made me lose a lot of faith in humanity. So, what's the best thing you've seen someone do?	A friend of mine broke his arms one summer and his Mum looked after him really well. That was nice of her.	I watched a man run into a burning building to save strangers he didn't even know. Heck I was scared shitless yet this random guy placed the lives of those inside above his and ran into the building several times. He saved 4 lives that day but when he found out there was still someone inside that building when it burned down, he broke down crying. Like he was ashamed he couldn't save them all...	0
Is it poor form to ask your current job to match the salary of a job you've applied to and gotten?	It will hurt you in the long run. So you basically blackmail your current employer with the threat of more money, or you leave. They should let you go on the spot, at that point. Say that they do offer a raise. There is going to be a lot of resentment, and you will be a target from that point forward. They might even just bait you along, knowing your other offer is gone, and fire you a month later. Ask for an opportunity to discuss your salary, but don't even mention the other job offer. If they can't or won't give a raise, then you tender your resignation and leave on good terms.	My first boss once told me, "Never accept a counter offer." If your present employer agrees to match your new offer, then even if they give it to you, they know that you're trying to get a new job... and you'll be the first to go when they need to get rid of someone. I've seen it happen three times in my career, so I'm inclined to trust her judgment. Now, what you *should* do is approach your current employer and tell them that you feel you deserve a raise. *Don't* mention the other offer at all. If they don't give it to you, you've always got the new job offer... and if the new job falls through, you've still got your old job.	0
What's something everyone knows but no one wants to admit?	Pretty sure even hardcore Hillary fans know the woman is a couple beers short of a six pack. Some people just want to watch the world burn I guess	People want to see others doing well, but not better than them. edit: i get that not everyone agrees with this, and thats good	0
Reddit, what is one skill that you are determined to obtain?	Yoga. I know it sounds gay. But I think yoga is super intense. Plus gaining flexibility can only help with my physical being. Plus sex.	The ability to start spontaneous conversations with strangers. My parents are extremely good at this. I don't know how they ended up with such socially challenged children.	0
[NSFW] Besides my mom, what is the best/worst sexual encounter you ever had?	Best was my first. I managed multiple goes and after she cautioned me she didn't orgasm easy I got her off nine times. Ferris Bueller win right there. My worst is the girl I hook up with now. Can't get off half the time. Only one weak orgasm if I can. And her blow jobs have more teeth than Shark Week.	Was in the hot tub with girlfriend. She sits on my lap and I manage to get my shorts down enough and her swimsuit aside enough to achieve penetration. Her mum come out to see us and sits down to talk while my girlfriend is "sitting on my lap". I splooged inside my girlfriend while looking at and talking to her mum.	0
Calling all cat owners of reddit! What does your cat do to let you know that they do actually love you, and aren't just using you for food and shelter?	My cats actively try to kill me in my sleep. Maybe it's their sick way of proving their love to me.	when my mom broke her foot, her cat Joe brought her FIVE mice/voles/unidentifiable bits of rodent. he knew his human was wounded and wanted to help, sweet little guy!	0
What's a clever way you have avoided paying for something?	When my son was about to be born, we had to stay a while at the hospital and the parking time bill racked up really quickly. Been there for 4 to 5 days so that was about 15-20$ per day ... But you only had to pay a 20$ fine to get out if you lost your ticket. Lets say I played the "I lost my parking ticket I'm so sorry" game.	I've been caught stealing Once when I was 5 I enjoy stealing It's just as simple as that Well, it's just a simple fact When I want something, I don't want to pay for it I walk right through the door	1
[Serious] American (USA) redditors how many of you actually own guns, what types and how close do you keep them??	I don't own a gun, nor do I plan to. I just don't see how it would help anything - I'm not trained to use it. I'm not at all against the right to own a gun, but I don't think that arguing for SOME kind of gun control measures is the same as revoking a right to own a gun. We have harsher laws to drive a car or get a passport than we do to own a handheld machine that can kill people.	I live on a ranch in Texas. We have rifles, shotguns, and pistols. If a coyote is going after the chickens we grab a rifle. If I take the dogs out for a walk I take a pistol for rattle snakes or even an angry wild boar. It's a way of life in the country.	0
What is the craziest thing you have done/confessed while playing truth or dare? What were it's consequences?	We were in a hottub with a group of friends, and were slightly inebriated. My girlfriend was on my lap, and I admitted the deed that was done. :P The rest of the tub was displeased.	My best friend ended up having a threesome with his prom date and our other friend's prom date. We don't play truth or dare anymore.	0
Adults of Reddit: When was the first time you tried to do something that you are normally capable of, but your body just said "NO"?	I'm 21 and can no longer fold myself into a pretzel like I supposedly used to do as a baby.	I was maybe 20 and I did some serious physical work. Something in my body screamed NO and I had to go to the hospital. Since then I've always thought twice before lifting.	1
What is your WoW memory that really brings back the nostalgia?	Back in middle school when WoW came out, I played it quite a bit. I played until about level 30, for a few weeks on and off (few hours here and there). I remember I was talking to my friend on teamspeak, and said "man, the only thing that pisses me off about this game, is it's so hard to find the quest givers". You know you can see the little "!" on the map, right? "yeah, but the minimap is so small, I always get lost". Hit M. "holy shit". I had hand drawn maps of certain areas, so I could find my way around using the roads/landmarks, because I did not realize there was a god damn world map for 30 levels.	Not WoW, but still by Blizzard. Basically playing Diablo 2 and rushing people to level up while I get to collect stronger runes for myself. Brings back old memories when I had time to grind for hours.	1
Introverts who are married or live with their SO, do you still "recharge" when around them or do you still need to be completely alone to feel at ease?	My husband is an extrovert, so he goes and hangs with his friends a few nights a week. They game and watch bad movies and have a good time and I get to sit in silence or watch the dramatic movies he mocks. We live in an itty-bitty apartment, so this is necessary for my sanity.	Introvert with introvert SO. I get exhausted around people extremely quickly, but I find that my girlfriend recharges me. She's the first person I've ever met who I can be with constantly and not feel drained. We do have time spent together where we don't talk much, but the act of being together during is still enjoyable. If we're each reading or on our phones or something we'll be in physical contact, or need to interject a kiss now and then. She gets me.	0
what is the most sexually disturbing thing your partner has ever done?	This is pretty mild, but I'd have to say the most sexually disturbing thing my husband has done was ask me to suck on his nipples. It was when we first started dating and it was in the heat of the moment so despite being weirded out by it I did it anyway. He never asked me to do it again and we never spoke of it after the fact. This was about 5 years ago now. Like I said, it's pretty mild, but it was weird to me and he must have either sensed that (since he never asked for it again) or I'm just bad at sucking on nipples.	My ex liked looking at my vagina. Just looking; no sound, touch, anything. The weird thing is, the "just staring" works better than a blowjob for him; he'd come back up rock hard and dribbling. It's weird, just lying there with my legs in gynecologist-position while he'd spend a silent 20-30 minutes down there before anything happened. Sometimes I'd nudge him with my foot because he looks like he's fell asleep in between my legs. He never understood why I just wasn't that into receiving oral sex.	0
That annoying coworker - what does he/she keep doing?	Prints. Every. Fucking. Thing. All day long. From the moment he gets here until the moment he leaves. Receives an email? Print it. Sends an email? Prints it. Googles something? PRINTS THE RESULTS PAGE.	He does everything correctly. Like, by the book and ridiculously meticulous about every detail. Now our boss is on everyone else's case to be exactly like him, even though if we were all anal like that, there's no doubt we'd fall behind schedule on all of our sites.	1
To all of those in the military. What was the funniest thing that happened to you or you saw while in boot camp?	When I was on Parris Island about 6 years ago, I was on fire watch overnight when our Senior Drill Instructor came out of his room. He walked around the squad bay and up to a rack with a dead-asleep recruit on the top bunk. He proceeded to shake the rack screaming at the recruit that he was hiding something. The recruit awoke terrified while the Senior DI pulled the mattress out from under him all the while asking the recruit what he was hiding. Then walked back into his room. The kid nearly shit himself. Absolutely hilarious. I have about a million of these.	I was on firewatch at around midnight, and the Drill Instructor made me go around and take everyone's flashlight (there were 75 of us) from them, switch out the lenses so they were all different colors (red, blue, or white), then he called over some other recruits to attach all the flash lights to my persons. I was wearing 75 flash lights, they were attached EVERYWHERE on me, all my pockets had lights sticking out, along the lining of my clothing. I was then instructed to turn them all on and then "spin around like a disco ball" They called me the discoball from that point forward. It was pretty awesome honestly, I started laughing when I was doing it.	0
30 year olds of Reddit, what's something you regret about your twenties?	Spending 8 years of my life with some dumb bitch who cheated on our 8th year. We started dating in high school. Boy that was big mistake. I should have spent all that time fucking random bitches. So when we broke up, that's exactly what I did.	Not staying in shape; it's hard but you can bounce back--but taking ten years or so off looking after your health is a bad idea.	0
Are you for or against using the Oxford Comma, and why?	I feel so strongly about this, I don't even know where to begin. The Oxford comma is so important. It creates clarity and consistency. It takes 0.2 seconds to throw it in there. Just do it.	I'm against the oxford comma. It's confusing, doesn't look right, throws off the flow of reading and is unnecessary. The "and" works perfectly fine in the place of the comma. If you're confused by the meaning of the sentence because of the lack of an oxford comma, blame the writer for not using clearer language.	1
Reddit, what fad do you hope dies out with the year 2015?	I might be in the minority, but I'd love to see hip hop and rap fall off the radio charts and be replaced with Rock.	Facebook pictures of sick kids, or a soldier, or a 100 year old man, or whatever with a caption like "how many likes for this ......?" I saw one the other day that was a picture of a dog looking sad with the caption "I bet I can't even get one like". Seriously what the fuck is this about? If your picture gets 1 like or 1 trillion likes, what's the fucking difference? It's not like you get $1 for every like. Just fuck off with that shit.	0
I had to tell my girlfriend that the guy she was cheating on me with died. What other kinds of emotionally conflicting things have you experienced?	That I knew the guy my mom was "hanging" out with while my dad was on deployment wasn't my uncle, but in fact her first husband that she thought I knew nothing about.	Haha that's hilarious, you should rub it in your girl's face (you picked a clumsy idiot that drown in a shower over me) and dump her fat cheating ass, she can go fuck the dead blue guy.	1
[Serious] Crazy exes of reddit, what did you do to be considered crazy and why did you do it?	Good lord, too many times. My marriage didn't survive my affair with her aunt. Granted, there were extenuating circumstances that should have driven me to leave long before, but when I screw up, I like to swing for the fences.	Ah, just the usual begging/bargaining "get back with me, blah, blah, blah." I actually managed to get back together with her for a month before things were obvious to me that the realationship wouldn't work. Years after that, and even still I occasionally wonder where she is, or what she's doing. If you've ever loved someone, it's basically impossible to "get over them". You just deal with your feelings about it more rationally. Eventually you won't think about them as much, but it's still there.	0
Which jobs attract only a certain type of person?	Are you an abusive formal high school bully? Do you have an erection when you trample someone's constitutional rights? Are you ok with ruining the future of young men?? Come on down!! We are looking for candidates in the law enforcement industry.	I work as a bouncer and we basically only get two types of people. Wannabe cops with anger issues, and former felons with anger issues.	0
A fruit cup landed me in front of several police with guns drawn. Reddit, what are your best "Well that escalated quickly" stories?	You should have been cited, cops failed. I hope you at least learned that it's dangerous and irresponsible to throw shit into oncoming traffic, and your friends will stop the "harmless fun" of hurling objects at cars.	I was sitting at an outdoor cafe. Dude I kind of know comes up and sits with me and person I was chatting with. I'm not really paying attention, drinking my tasty drink. Dude gets out a thing, which turns out to be a lighter in the shape of a tiny gun and starts taking it apart, fixing it or refilling it or something. Apparently there's an armored car across the street. They (apparently) somehow get a glimpse of the tiny gun lighter, call police and before I know what's up we've all got guns in our faces, angry police shouting at us not to move and are being pushed down on the sidewalk. Dude is cuffed and searched, then let go, me and other person are let up shaking to return to our spilled drinks. It wasn't awesome. :(	0
What's the best t-shirt that you own?	I have a Microsoft Bing shirt with the bing logo in the bottom left corner on the front that I had to earn via their reward points program before they took off all the physical merchandise and replaced it with points cards. American Apparel, the most comfortable and best fitting shirt I own since I dropped a bunch of weight. Also, my middle name is Bingham. Best thing to come out of that search engine.	My Wilford brimley " You know i have diabetes!" T-shirt always shocks people when i wear it out, Many people have told me its offensive claiming they have diabetes that's when i whip out the ole insulin pen and say " You know i have diabetes!".	0
What's the most noteworthy thing that has happened to you in the last 24 hours?	My father died, congestive heart failure, I guess. No autopsy so not super sure. Died in his sleep, I can't forget his face though. I was the one that found him. I couldn't do anything to stop it. If I had found him earlier maybe I could, but probably not. He was a great dad, a great person, great man. I miss him, my mother is a fucking wreck. He was 55, and my grandmother is 90 still alive, so my mother who is also 55 is worried about living half her life alone. I can't say I blame her. If you bother to read this and your dad is still around, spend some time with him dammit.	Found a dead deer on the side of the road, threw it in the back of my mom's minivan, tied a rope to its feet, threw it into the water, and tied the other end of the rope to the dock. Now that is how you bait some damn fish. 100% true story, no bs.	1
What event has happened in your life that you cannot explain to this day?	When my Grandfather died, my parents were in charge of cleaning out his old house. I ended up helping out a couple of times and the night before we were finished I had a dream about my Grandfather is his basement pointing at a spot behind the staircase. It was so vivid and real that I had to tell everyone about it. The next and final day of cleaning we went to the spot I was talking about. My dad ended up pulling back some old wood paneling and found a bunch of old photographs of when my grandparents first moved into the house. I still get goosebumps when I think about it, and have them now while typing.	My husband fell in love with me. To this day, I'm still baffled (but not interested in ever letting go).	1
A mother yelled at her child (probably 2 years old) for saying hi to me because I was a stranger, then glared at me for saying hello back. Any other overbearing parents in public stories out there?	I'm totally cool with adult men saying hello to my daughter when she is 3. I am incredibly not cool with adult men saying hello to my daughter when she is 13.	At the family entertainment center I work at a mom asked my male manager if he can ask the dads to leave the play park area because she wasn't comfortable with the idea of men in the tubes, even with their own kids. My boss told her hes not going to do that and if she doesnt like it she can leave.	0
Where does a pedophile go to get help?	Islam prescribes fasting to subdue ones desires. Not the simple starvation of the body from food and drink, but the constant control of ones emotions and self. Let me know if you would be interested in finding more about this. Peace be with you.	Start with counseling. They won't turn you in or anything, they're good at resolving sources of problems. Start there. Please, before you ruin someone's life.	0
What's your worst "they were standing right behind me" story?	So a couple of years ago i went to Archon in Illinois, where in I proceeded to taunt a "little person" who was "handi-capable" and in a "motorized movement contraption" behind his back... well I made up a song about it along the lines of "Midget in a wheel chair, Not going no where, no body cares, midget in a wheel chair" with a nice blusey jazzy beat... well later i go to get a hot dog... and am singing the song and who is behind me? you guessed... and lets just say he wasnt to happy	Okay: Let me start by saying that I DID NOT KNOW that the new math teacher at my school only had one leg. I did not know. She always wore a prosthesis. Anyway, one day a bunch of us were waiting in line to make copies at our school's only copy machine; which had jammed, of course...and I made some stupid comment to the room at large about what a waste of time it was to be standing there waiting for a broken copier...and that it was about as useful as being a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest. Cue crickets chirping loudly as the room fell silent and all eyes fell on the teacher behind me who, FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, was NOT wearing her prosthetic leg. I felt horrible about that.	0
What's on your bucket list? Redditors who have done that thing, what was the experience like?	I want to jump out of an airplane wearing nothing but my parachute and masturbate to completion before pulling the ripcord. Probably have to get started on the plane, which could be awkward.	1. Catch a tarpon 2. See the northern lights 3. Go to a zero light pollution zone 4. Sky dive 5. Swim with sharks without a cage 6. Hand feed a shark 7. Take a ride on a sharks fin There's more just haven't thought about it much yet.	0
Former pickpockets of Reddit, where's the best place to keep phone/wallet/keys so they're safe when traveling to congested cities?	I travel all the time, and keep a "mugger's wallet" on me. The wallet has about $10 cash, cancelled (but not expired) credit cards, and "filler" such as old receipts and coupons to make it look real. I keep it in my side pocket. If someone steals it/robs me, I only lose $10. I keep my real wallet inside a special inside-jacket pocket. Don't keep a license in a mugger wallet, they might retaliate if they know where you live.	I'm surprised someone hasn't mentioned one of the easiest & cheapest ways to prevent pickpocketing; take a few rubber bands and wrap them around your wallet/cellphone.	0
What's something everyone sees as 'normal' but you don't agree with?	Needing experience for a basic job. Like fuck you Target, why do I need 2 years experience to fold clothes and put them on the shelf?	How most other left-wing people think that illegal immigration is a good thing. I never understand why they support it.	1
What verifiable fact do people hate to hear?	Your kid is more likely to be kidnapped by a relative/friend/acquaintance than the random stranger you stank eye at the park.	That voting ether Republican or Democrat really dosent matter they give us the choice to make us think we have control. we're fucked ether way. The same companies will always control our politics, media, and rights.	1
Why don't the elections in the US happen in Sundays like in other countries, so that more people can vote?	hahahahahahahaha Is this a joke ? Of course we can't vote on Sunday, it's church day for all those people that attend it every Sunday. There would probably be a huge protest if we did that. Forbid we do anything on Sunday that isn't related to "God". (no offence. just being honest)	When the law was created it required a lot of travel to get to the voting booths sometimes requiring a whole day. Sundays were traditionally reserved as a day of rest so Monday was out and Wednesday was commonly used as a market day for most farmers. So it was decided to put it on Tuesday	0
Reddit, what's the biggest misconception about your job?	I am a stay at home mom, people think I just sit around watching tv all day. I wish I had time for that. I stay so busy with everyone's schedules, I am only on here when I am waiting in line to pick a kid up or in some other waiting situation and that is only when I have already answered emails and other stuff.	Receptionist here. I don't just answer the phone. I hand out pens, refill plastic water cups, & tell clients where the bathroom is too.	0
Should a Law be Passed to Make Vaccinations Mandatory? If so What Penalties Should Apply to People who Refuse to Vaccinate Anyway?	In Portugal, vaccination is not mandatory, but for a child to attend any public school, even university, has to have its vaccination up to date. This system works pretty well for us, considering that about 90% of kids go to a public school. For countries where this isn't the case, governmental child support and tax breaks could be cut.	Yes fuck those assholes. If people are to stupid to take care of their own (children) someone has to do it. It's not like they are a thread to their own children / themself, they are a thread to anyone with a weak immun system and / or can not be vaccinated for medical reasons. Punishments ? - no access to anything where a lot of people meet. Kindergarten, school, concerts, cinemas, trains, planes, just to name a few....	1
People of Reddit, what's something you've done in your life that you feel most people would have regretted, but you don't?	Maintained my virginity...shocking I know! I'm soooo grateful that I've focused more on my character, choices, and caring about others instead of letting media, culture, or even my hormones decide when I go all the way. It may not be a big deal to many...but its a big deal to me. It took a lot of self control (and I haven't been perfect)...and having strong values has kept me from drowning even more emotionally in relationships that didn't deserve even more investment of my heart and time.	Got married to my first girlfriend. We've known each other since we were 5. We were best friends forever, and when puberty hit it hit hard. We're still best friends. I just bang the brains out of my best friend almost every night going on about 18 years soon.	0
Who's that one coworker you can't stand and why?	The fat old fuck piece of shit that makes more than anyone else simply because he has worked there for like 20 years. He is useless and just doesn't do his job most of the time, yet he makes more than double what I do. He also doesn't get punished for not doing his job while I get bitched at for forgetting to do some minor thing... like emptying a god damned trash can. He also like to rant about things that he thinks are "fuckin bullshit" like minimum wage workers wanting to make a livable wage and how it is driving up the price of his breakfast burritos. According to him, minimum wage jobs are for teenagers and degenerates... even though he does fuck all at work and makes over $35/hr to do it.	Fuck you, Kennedy. I used to work in a Chick Fil A kitchen, and it was a very simple system. Kennedy makes the sandwhiches, when she starts running out of chicken she calls to me to make more. I make more. Every fucking day, at least five times, she would yell over to me, "Where are those nuggets I called for?" YOU DIDN'T CALL FOR NUGGETS. Then she'd give me attitude because she had a red shirt on meaning she was a team leader and I was just a team member. Fuck you, Kennedy.	0
What is your darkest secret, which you have never told anyone about?	Throwaway for obvious reasons. I have the sweetest SO in the world. He's never done a single thing to hurt me, but he's not motivated/driven, a bit immature, and not great in bed. I've been having an affair with someone rich, famous, and also 20 years older than me. The other man has been flying me to a different state on the weekends to spend time with him. Realistically, I could never see myself with this guy, but it just feels so good to not worry about money, to have sex with someone who is amazing at it, and to be with someone mature, successful, and driven for a change. Edit: I know it's shitty, and the situation with my SO is much more complicated than can be expressed here. I'm finally facing my actions by admitting it to myself. The question was asked, so I answered honestly.	When I was five my mum left my dad. I don't remember much other than shortly afterwards my Dad would get in my bed late at night, hold me and sob. I would pretend to be asleep. I've never told anyone that. I'm 35 and I've never seen or heard my father cry since. He's never said a negative thing about my mother. They've remained friends. I can tell he still loves her.	0
What is a topic that can be used to revive a dying conversation?	"What movie will you stop to watch every time you come across it?" This usually gets a good discussion going and you learn a lot about people's tastes in movies.	There's no secret answer, all depend on the people involved in the conversation, the time of the conversation, what's happening around you etc As many people have joked about, sports is usually a good way to talk to guys though if you're not interested in it, it seems a bit pointless.	1
What is one crazy story from work that you've been waiting to tell?	We had this 500 pound cad designer, who was a notorious snarky asshole and is probably on reddit. After he was fired we checked his linkedin page and we could tell from the background that he was sitting on the toilet in the photo.	Caged Wisdom changed my life. At work, a rustic cowpoke happened to be living alive, lforcefully fumbling across the wind	1
My boyfriend's mother proudly told me that her son had a big wang. It was awkward and hilarious at the same time. What awkward story have you been told about your SO?	About 2 months into dating my ex I stayed round her house. We get it on during the night, roll over and fall asleep. Next morning I go downstairs to make a cup of tea and bump into her brother. Brother: I thought you guys had dinner before you got here? Me: Yeah we did, how come? Brother: Well, it sounded like she enjoyed her Chinese last night. Couldn't look the dude in the eyes for a couple of weeks... **Edit:** Yes, I can confirm I'm Asian.	You gonna lube up yer cock and balls and wack it for a little bit? And while yer at it you can put some on your brother's ding dong and knock around his nuts for him. You can stare at my jugs and play with that healthy wang of yours.	1
Redditors who attended their 10-year high school reunion, what made the experience sad or happy?	I had just come off a really successful diet and was the best looking guy there. Girls who never talked to me at school were openly flirting with me in front of their boyfriends.	We had to fill in cards about what we were up to these days. The cards got circulated and then stuck up on a big board for everyone to browse. At the end of the night I found one that said "for the last 10 years, I've been supplementing my income by sucking off park bums." Signed with my name. It's a comfort to have friends. Especially if they haven't grown up since grade 12.	0
I have just moved to Australia to start a new job. One month in my boss has let me go. I now have no job, no money and no idea what I'm going to do. Any advice, AskReddit?	Uh...suck it up and get another job? Or just cry in a corner and go broke. You know, which ever works best.	You are in Australia, buddy. $16/h minimum wage and 5.1% unemployment. Shine your shoes, go knock on some doors and find a job. Not that hard. I've done it 2-3 times.	0
What sequence of events in life led you to where you are now?	Bullied all throughout middle school and high school. Self harm. Tried suicide. Mental hospital for a week. Parents divorced. Raped twice at different parties. "Friends" all stop talking to me after I got raped because I "changed" Eating disorder. Bullying stops, now I'm in college. Get a cat and make new (and better) friends. Get a part time job while going to school. I don't self harm anymore, but I still have that eating disorder whoops. I plan on getting my masters after I get my bachelors and become a therapist.	My parents signed the permission slip to play the violin when I was in 4th grade. Now I'm almost 30 and a professional musician.	0
My grandpa's girlfriend is vocally opposed to President Obama because he is a "socialist." She receives monthly disability from the government for bipolar disorder. What political hypocrisies piss you off?	As a Canadian, it drives me absolutely insane that so many of my friends will religiously follow American politics, but they can't be fucked to watch Canadian politics or even vote. What is the point?!	Bring on the downvotes: liberals who constantly brag about how 'tolerant' they are, but if you're religious and/or vote Republican, you're a totally evil person and your opinion has no value whatsoever. Essentially, you're not tolerated.	1
What are some good or interesting but not-so-popular subreddits?	Shameless plug for /r/unfortunateplacement It's about unfortunately placed advertisements. I started it some months ago, it's not often posted in, but there's some great stuff in there anyway.	I've started a few subreddits that are still pretty small because I'm not very good at making them well-known. /r/shotglasses because I collect shot glasses /r/snowmen because it didn't exist yet /r/atheistpodcasts because I listen to podcasts on my 40 minute commute, and there are a lot of atheism related podcasts out there.	1
What is the most pointlessly irritating thing your neighbour has done?	They sit on the sidewalk in front of the apartment and smoke. I have to walk past them frequently and the smell is irritating. I don't understand why people still smoke after all these years of medical data.	Came home from middle school one day to find my neighbor and a few arborists cutting down our (probably) 100+ year old oak tree in our backyard. This guy let them believe it was his house and lemme tell you they were PISSED when they found out he lied to them. His reason? Some of the branches hung over his property line. In the end we sued him and made him pay to have an old oak uprooted and transported from a nearby site. So he ended up paying for the arborists fee and a tree relocation (which are both quite expensive). Total asshole.	0
Non-Americans of Reddit, those of you who have visited the U.S., what was the experience like? Did you enjoy it or not enjoy it? Did it meet your expectations? What could we have done to have made it a better experience?	From England Went to New York Family were talking Homeless man overhears us calls us filthy tea drinkers 10/10 would go again	I lived in the states for a while back in 2000 in Vermont. Was horrible. People were nice to my face but would call me a "filthy foreigner" behind my back. I am a white Canadian. I was like... uhhhh.... wtf? Also, the curiculum was about a year behind what I was at the time. (I was in grade 4, everything being taught I had already covered in grade 3 up here.) Every week I had to go and talk to the school's guidance counselor to see how I was "assimilating into the American lifestyle" all because I failed a spelling test because I put u's in my words (colour, honour, favourite, neighbour etc...) But the cafeteria served hot food that was decent, which was cool. 2/10 would not recommend.	1
what advice would you give your 13 year old self?	The winning Powerball numbers for 6/3/15 are 6-8-13-37-40, Powerball is 11. Play it. That way I don't screw up the timeline, except maybe the last couple of days, I hope.	You're transgender. Book an appointment with your GP, ask to go on hormone blockers. Also, stop wearing those red pants and get some better friends, like K instead of T.	1
What is your most interesting, yet useless piece of information you have?	If you borrowed £100 from wonga.com (instant loan provider) and didnt make any repayments for 7 years, you'd owe more than the US national debt.	George Washington wasn't the first president. He was the 8th president. He was just the first under the constitution. edit: 8th, not 7th	1
To the 40+ year olds, 20 years ago, do you think the kids were as babied and spoiled as they are today?	Not even remotely close. I am stunned at the level of entitlement and disrespect that kids today have. It's not really their fault (entirely) though. Parenting over the last 20 years has gone right down the toilet. Parents expect everyone else, like teachers, to raise their kids for them. My son is well adjusted, independent, goal oriented, selfless and respectful. That's at 22. We took the time to mentor and guide him on a daily basis. We knew that our ONLY job as parents was to prepare him for the world. He has always worked hard and has earned almost everything he has. When I look at the rest of his friends, I'm appalled and so is he. Almost every one of them has been mixed up with the law or other things multiple times. I guess the fault really lies with my generation for not collectively doing our job.	I don't know if spoiled is the word. Sheltered, perhaps. Growing up, it was nice to play (and create havoc and get into occasional trouble) without adults hovering over our every move. Three TV channels got mighty boring- so out the door we went. Building forts and damming up small creeks and capgun fights in the woods was the sort of play that made us feel independent, along with trips to the convenience store for snacks. Riding a bike in a cul-de-sac while being watched and supervised constantly, with recreation in the form of play dates seems so depressing.	0
Redditors who have actually been to your 10 year high school reunion: what is the biggest transformation you've seen someone make in that 10 years?	I was the second biggest transformation at my 10-year. I went from 90 lb awkward nerd to confident bodybuilder/kickboxer. Also it was awkward getting hit on by a few of the former cheerleaders and one of the "cool" girls offering to have a threesome with me and one of her friends. I declined. The biggest was a clean-cut guy in high school. Always real calm, relaxed, dressed nicely, relatively thin, etc... Now he is this gigantic, probably 320 lb biker. I was glad that he was my friend in high school, since he was pretty damn scary looking dude.	One of my neighbors growing up was that super motivated Type A do everything types. Co-valedictorian, captain of the hockey team, gifted musician...just always working. 10 year reunion, went just how we all expected. Full ride to Yale, Harvard MBA, six figure Wall Street job, gorgeous fiance...and he seemed utterly miserable. 10 years later, 20th reunion. He got sick of it all, quit his job, sold his house, got divorced, and got out of town. He now owns a pig farm in Upstate New York, spends his days working the farm, brewing beer, and hiking in the forest...and I've never met a happier, more satisfied person in my life.	0
For those who did NOT live together with their spouse before getting married, how was it adapting to living together full time?	Oh Lord, I am going to show this thread to my parents & make them realise that "living in sin" is the best way to determine compatability. 🙄😏	It worked well for us. We'd been dating 8 years beforehand, which was plenty of time to see and know each other's home habits. There are still little things I do that irks him, and the same goes for his habits that irk me. But, you look past the little things for the bigger picture. Even if it means you have to put up with his 400+ movie collection, and that he does laundry but always shoves it in the hamper instead of immediately folding it. ;)	0
Men of Reddit, what bullshit are you tired of?	My god damn coworker that never puts his phone on silent. He's also a momma's boy so about three times a day his mom's ringtone goes off and its Stewie Griffin's voice yelling "MOM MOM MOMMY MOMMY MOMMA"	MRA/ anti-feminist ass-hats preaching their warped garbage where the male experience of cultural misogyny is recast as misandry. As if they don't mind the culture of misogyny we live in, just as long as it victimizes women (and not men) like its "supposed" to.	1
As I was showering this morning I started running my hands through my hair while still holding my razor. What are some of those poor life choices you've made while not quite awake in the morning?	I made some food in a casserole dish, took it out of the over with my had wrapped in a towel to protect me from the obviously super hot dish. I place it down on top of the oven and of course with my other hand that is not covered I reach down and pick up my cell and drunk text my ex. FML.	My eye was inflamed and my doctor recommended I heat up some water on the stove and apply hot compresses to it. Woke up, decided I didn't want to wait for the stove to heat up my water and put the **metal** pot of water into the microwave. ^tl;dr **^RIP ^microwave.**	0
What is your best pro tip for new college students?	if your campus offers greek life do it. you will be better off in the worst house on campus than not in one at all. i know greeks typically have a negative stereo type, but they typically have higher gpa than non greeks, and are more involved. if you try it and don't like it then quitting is fine, its not for everyone. I would say going greek is one of the best decisions i have made in my life.	Sleep more than your study, study more than you party, and party as much as you can. EDIT: I heard this from somewhere so I can't take any credit for this genius advice.	0
Depressed people of Reddit who have been told in the comments to PM them to "talk" - how did that go?	When I was going through a break-up and felt incredibly lost and lonely, I asked people in my city if they’d be willing to meet up with me for breakfast to keep my mind off the gloom and doom. A bunch of people replied and only one went through with it. He and I had breakfast and talked about life. It was so kind of him. He gave me a little boost of encouragement when I was at the lowest point in my life.	terrible. the person messaged me and was super condescending, i told him his “help” wasn’t appreciated, then he told me i was to blame for my suicidal depression. fuck you u/veatchdave	1
What are you Banned from?	I was once banned from a bakery. I was a high school student, and when I made my food order, the woman said, what's the magic word, and I said sausages. And she barred me.	Banned from Quora for speaking in favor of trumps immigration policy. I didn't even swear, use racial slurs, or say anything offensive.	1
Which character did not deserve to die?	Harambe Can we get an F please Edit: holy crap my first reddit award, thanks kind stranger! Love all the love for Harambe, F.	Sirius Black. Troubled childhood, disowned by his own family. Suffering 12 years in Azkaban between monsters that literally suck all happiness out of him, screaming for mercy, all for a crime you did not commit, while everyone outside called him a traitor for betraying his friends, the man who had seen little happiness in life. Enduring and escaping only to protect his best friend's son. And dying just as the fog started clearing out once again.	0
What did the weird kid at your school do?	Asked my girlfriend for a thong, it was a guy, when clarified he said "the one you are waring"... I was standing right there, kid got punched in the damn face	He taped manila folders up and down his arms and jumped off benches at recess, trying to fly. Then he'd get actually mad when he hit the ground, adjusted the folders a bit, and went back on the bench. He also wore a Linux polo to school every day. It was 5th grade.	0
I have friends (yes, plural) that think that you can't be racist if you're a minority. What are some misconceptions you've heard that made you seriously reconsider your choices in friends?	Depending on your defenition of racism this can be true. I know of at least one definition for racism that requires that you have institutional power to be racist. If one is simply talking about prejudice based on race then I think those people are mistaken. But I'd make sure both sides in the discussion were using the term racism in the same way.	I got into an argument with a friend because I called a person in a wheelchair an asshole. I see everyone as equal, and if you're being an asshole, I will call you out on it.	0
Which common ingredient ruins food for you?	**Eggs.** Nothing like chocolate chip cookies with a faint hint of raw poultry. Why do these mozzarella sticks taste like an omelette? Why? "I just spent 2 hours making croissants with organic butter...let's smear some eggs on them and toss them in the oven." "Let's fry these fresh shrimp I caught! But first, let's dip them in raw eggs!"	I like most of the foods in this thread, but I'm enjoying reading how passionate people are about hating them.	0
Teachers of Reddit what is the juiciest gossip going on in your school right now?	My mom's a sub and she found a girl trying her hardest to seduce one of the construction workers who were putting new air conditioners. The guy believed the girl when she said she was 18. She was 15 and a huge slut.	One of the Pre-k kids told his teacher that he hates her because she's black. His mom kept him and his 2 year old sister home the rest of her week, but when they came back the next week, his sister just kept saying over and over "Andrew in BIG trouble."	0
[Serious] What is the most valuable lesson you've learned from Reddit?	That when someone is asking for specific links to threads, you can be 100% sure that they didn't bother searching for previous threads with that exact title, and so you shouldn't ever indulge them.	Reddit has shown over and over that there are good people out there who are willing to help. A few weeks ago, there was a post about someone who needed a kidney. Not long after that, another person created a sub for people who were looking for a donor and for those willing to donate. The internet isn't all bad.	0
What is the craziest thing you've seen/done at a party?	As a guy in AA and in active sobriety, I have to laugh at how tame some of these are. Good for all your normals	group of kids decided to try and make cotton candy by pouring sugar into a spin dryer. it caught fire.	0
Why isn't Sauron invisible when he wears the ring?	If you're a little bitch hobbit, it doesn't do as much for you (because you're a bitch). Just invisibility and extended life (probably the same if you're common blood human). If you're dunedain or istari or some badass mofo, it would enhance your already badassishness to a whole new level, though.	Based on how much screen time he gets, I'd say Sauron is always invisible... until he puts the ring on.	0
People who have had their car "pimped" on Pimp My Ride, what has become of your car and what was your experience like overall?	I know mad mike and he told me most people would ruin the cars about an hour after filming. I might be able to get him to do a ama if there's enough interest. Edit: I sent him a message. I'll let you guys know! Edit 2: he is interested. Can a mod pm me and let me know what we have to do? Edit 3: emailed mods of iama Edit 4: heard from the mods of iama, they're going to get back to me about whether it will be on the calendar or if he will just create the thread.	What do you think are the chances that someone who's car was pimped would actually see this and respond with proof?	1
Randomly found this online after 12 years - What are some other things of yours you have randomly found around the Internet?	I made the first "Know What I'm Saiyin?" Dragon Ball Z meme. That thing got way more popular than I expected.	Not on the Internet, but when I was a little kid my mom bought me a 500-pack of pencils with my name on them. I lost most of them, and since then, they've popped up in the weirdest places imaginable, including one that was, my hand to God, in the drawer of the nightstand in a hotel three states away where we spent the night once.	0
People who have gotten married / moved in together after extremely short period (eg a few weeks) of dating, how did it turn out?	Met in July, first date in August, engaged in September, married in December, pregnant in February. Still incredibly happy 11 years later. We were both older (30s), and knew it was right.	So many settlers. So so many. Keep in mind a lot if these success stories come from desperadoes motivated by fear. Jumped at the first thing because you lack the goods of attraction.	1
People that have used "Hardcore" Drugs, How does it feel? is the media portrait of the effects accurate?	I was addicted to Opana's. It felt wayyy better than heroin. It has killed more of my old friends than heroin has. Stay the fuck away from it. Sober since December 2012!	For the most part. Acid is actually one of the safest "street drugs" around along with shrooms. As long as you dont go overboard. Heroin is not dangerous unless you mix it with benzos (xanax) or alchohol but it IS extremely addictive. PCP is can cause some people to trip out and go ballistic like its portrayed to do. Meth and Coke are highly addictive but can be used as true "recreational drugs" by the right person. Heroin feels great at first then after a month of using it gets old, same with meth and cocaine. If you can use drugs socially then the effects are always better but be very wary. ADDICTION can touch ANYONE. Im from Metro Detroit and a large number of former friends have or have had drug problems. Overall the media does portray opiate and meth addiction accurately	1
What was your 'why the fuck would you tell me that?' moment?	As a black person, you'll encounter the occasional white person who thinks it's okay to drop the N-bomb on you with little to no warning, whether it's to make a point, recite a song lyric, or do an impression. Usually it's because they got away with it with one black person or another black person in their life allows them to say it, as if there's some sort of Black Person Bulletin Board (BBB) or database where black people post the names of white people who have been granted permission to say the N-word by an official moderator of aforementioned website. "Oh my bad for getting offended, guess I haven't logged on in awhile" Sorry, white people, what will get you a laugh on one block WILL STILL get your head ripped off in another. Tread very carefully.	Dentist said to me, "Sorry if I seem off, I just accidentally cut my last patients gums. I need to get more sleep."	0
Trying to start a business. If you could buy a handmade hammock for $30, would you?	I am sorry, but I don't think you will succeed or learn anything from the experience. I predict a wasted 3-6 months. Unless you get bored of it sooner than that.	Honestly? $30 seems cheap for a handmade hammock. Have you done market research with real people? (No offense internet people) but for real, undervaluing a product can be worse than overpricing. People assume an item with a low price (relative to other similar products) is usually going to be poorly constructed with bad materials... But I'd check out mturk, or do real-life surveying to see what most people would pay for that product, before setting a price. I'd also charge more for custom colors. That being said- If I had a tree, I would buy your hammock.	0
(NSFW) What is the best accidental nudity you have seen?	I was walking along, and I see this beautiful girl, and I thought I'd like to see her naked, and so all her clothes fall off. She's scrabbling around to get them back on again, but even before she can get her knickers on, I've seen everything. Yeah. I've seen it all.	I work at McDonald's, and one day while I was handing a woman her food I saw that she was in the middle of sending nudes.	0
Why is your Ex-friend an Ex-friend?	I'm no longer friends with women I tried to friendship my way into sex with because friendship was never my goal. Remember guys, don't do that. Its a waste of everybody's time.	I realized that I only ever heard from her when she needed/wanted something. I stopped reaching out to her as an experiment, and didn't hear from her for close to a year, when she called me because she wanted help fixing a broken piece of furniture. Got a lot better at identifying the fake friends after that.	0
What screams "I spend too much time on Reddit"?	when reddit is down or its servers are busy so you go to check reddit so you have something to look at while you are waiting for reddit to work	Incessant Trump bitching. This is literally the only place I see such large amounts of vitriolic misinformation on a consistent basis.	1
What movie surprised you with how good it was?	Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Naive teenager sees Phantom Menace in theaters expecting mind to be blown, leaves bored and disappointed, becomes soured against future films. Cynical 34-year-old sees Force Awakens for a laugh, is surprised to find it quite entertaining, is now looking forward to the next installment, even some of the spin-offs.	Mean Girls. Never even considered watching it except a coworker quoted it constantly. Finally gave it a go and had to admit it was pretty good. Still not my kind of movie, but well done for the genre.	0
What is the worst example of 'rich people problems' you have seen?	My rich friend has had to respray his car multiple times because a peacock on his land keeps seeing his reflection in it and attacking it like crazy Edit: thanks for the gold! I'll let my friend know it wasn't all in vain	Feminists in first world countries thinking that they are oppressed when they have a far high standard of living than the vast majority of people in the world.	1
Reddit, what are you elitist about?	Shoes and socks. If your feet feel bad, your whole body feels bad. Edit: Oh wow, this blew up~and someone gave me gold? Thanks!	Manual transmissions. If you prefer an automatic, then fuck you. Some of us actually like to drive and enjoy being in control of our vehicles. Lazy automatic drivers have made it damn near impossible to get a proper transmission in most vehicles sold in the USA. The fact that I can't get a new full size pickup truck with a manual is dumbfounding and infuriating. Edit: I love the fact that I'm getting downvoted for expressing an elitist opinion in a thread asking for elitist opinions.	1
What should be banned, but isn't?	Tobacco. Boggles my mind that something that's proven to kill thousands of people a year continues to be legally sold everywhere.	If you can sign up for something online with no human contact, you shouldn't have to go through 3 different call centres to cancel it.	0
Reddit, what things do you do on a daily basis to make life more fun?	For every piece of work I don't want to do (homework, washing the car, tending to the yard, etc), I make it into a video game for myself. Example: Weeding. I take out the little weeds first to prepare myself for the final boss, the bigger weeds with those annoying thick roots. It makes "work" feel like a lot less work to me.	I watch the bfvsgf on YouTube. They are two youtubers that are a couple and they originally just pranked each other. Now they upload daily vlogs and everyday I look forward to watching them. They are so funny smart and just amazing human beings. I don't know why but I just live to watch their vlogs. Seriously people check em out.	1
Would you prefer a partner with an organic body and electronic "brain" or a partner with an organic brain and a robotic body? Why?	Organic body for sex and electronic brain because one of us needs to be able to stay focu /runs off to pet cats/	I would pick the electronic body and organic brain so it can have an existential crisis on whether to decide if she is human or machine.	0
What is something illegal that you'd always wanted to try out of curiosity?	If there was a stripper with lines of coke on her tits, I don't think I'd have the will to refuse. I'm susceptible to peer pressure, when it occurs in stripper form.	Rob a convenience store. Just all the food, not a whole lot of money, and if I did it, people who see all my new swag would just think I have the munchies.	0
What's the longest grudge against someone you still hold onto?	At a birthday party in second grade the kids parents handed out goodie bags with Pokémon cards in them and this one kid Owen cut me in line and got a first addition holographic Charazard in his pack. It was my goodie bag you fucking cut me owen I will never let you live this down Owen youre a bastard	Anyone who has messed with, or even been disrespectful towards, me or my family, at any point in our lives, is no longer in our lives. I don't forgive anything.	1
What do you hate about Reddit?	Hate is a strong word! There are two things that I really don't like though. 1) The ever-present online disinhibition effect. 2) Unsupported down votes.	Make one tiny mistake in your post? Maybe a typo or whatever? The comments will never fucking shut up about it.	0
What's a movie/show that you loved as child but now realize it totally stupid? And what's one that still holds up?	Shows: Used to love: dragon ball z. Watching it again, it's so formulaic, boring, and cheesy. Still holds up: Ren and Stimpy. The animation is timeless and the jokes are so absurd, they still make me laugh.	I just watched Ice Princess yesterday. I loved the movie when I was a kid but SHE GAVE UP HARVARD TO CHASE A DREAM OF BEING AN ICE SKATER. HARVARD. She could have gone to HARVARD and skated on the weekends! Ridiculousness. On the other hand, I still love Princess Diaries.	0
What’s the strangest compliment you’ve gotten?	I am pretty vascular. I was once told "Dude, you have great heroin veins. You could shoot up for years"	Dressed as Marilyn Monroe one year. Was walking with some friends down the street and a guy passing car yelled "NICE LEGS MARILYN!" Not sure if he knew I had a dick, but I was flattered nonetheless	1
What TV show did you lose interest in and at what point did you stop watching?	I know Reddit loves these shows, but Archer and Futurama really didn't hold my attention. I stopped watching Archer after the first season and Futurama soon after Jurassic Bark.	Fairly Odd Parents. It went so downhill after they introduced Poof. His birth episode was fine, but the others after it? No thanks. Nowadays, they have this super annoying little girl that Timmy apparently has to share his fairies with, and she's not even a miserable kid. She's super popular, super successful, and even Mr. Crocker loved her enough to not hunt Timmy's fairies for a bit. Not to mention, I hear they changed Crocker's backstory too. He went from that tragic kid who Timmy caused to lose his fairies to some asshole who abused them.	0
What’s something you know about a friends sex life that you wish you didn’t?	My friend in high school announced that she lost her virginity to her cousin but it was okay because it was anal......First time I really did not know what to say to her.....	During a weekend trip with friends, accidentally got a glimpse of one of my friend's boner while he was still asleep. Above average size, but not a "monster". Several times since then when hanging around, he'd brag about his big dick and girls struggling to take it or how it can get annoying sometimes. Some of his girlfriends would say the same to me when it was just us hanging out, about his dick hurting them. I've just held my tongue this whole time, because I know my dick is bigger than his, and I'm a woman. I don't want to emasculate him :x	1
What's the most simple thing that makes you really happy?	When strange animals come to me to get petted. They don't know me from Adam but I guess I can't be too bad, so that's pretty satisfying.	I'm a lesbian, and ever since i've been on reddit, one person messaged me in private to flirt a little bit. I've never been flirted with without starting. It still makes me smile. We don't talk anymore. Smile on my face right now. Someone found me interesting and that never happened before.	1
What first caused you to start hating 'kids these days'?	Teacher here (work at an F rated school). I find it really fascinating to look at a younger generation from an older perspective. To be honest, I really don't see a big difference in children now vs 20-30 years ago. Their environment hasn't really molded their ignorance or innocence in general. I think my hatred of their actions comes more from a difference in age rather than a product of the time.	Just how much bad shit they do. I remember wanting to have sex and drink and smoke pot in school but the stories I hear nowadays make me really sad. They think its normal to have 5-10 sexual partners by the time they graduate and its ok to do hard drugs on a regular basis Edit: I should clarify I'm talking about high school	1
Bob Ross once said "We don't make mistakes, we just have happy little accidents." What is an example of this in history?	Post-It Notes. The glue was original designed for another use but it didn't work. The guy ended up using it to keep his notes together and thus was born the Post-It Note.	A guy was making a smoothie when he accidentally mixed up dick in it. Real sad story of he died Edit: no, not his dick I meant some guy called dick	1
Is it okay for adults to sleep with stuffed animals? If there should be a cut off age, what age should it be?	I'm 38. You can pry my stuffed dragon from my cold, dead hands. Until then, it stays in my bed.	I find this a little strange. I can understand why, it just makes me wonder why you’d need the security or reassurance. Then again, I do have a night light.	1
What's the most awkward 3rd wheel experience you have had?	My girlfriend and my ex girlfriend and I decided we wanted to hook up together. My other housemate was a mutual friend of all of us, and was fourth wheeling hard. My girlfriend was so drunk that she tried to include him because she felt bad for him. I almost punched him in the face for going near her It was a bad time.	I carpool with my roommates (my newly pregnant best friend and her fiance). She had an ultrasound appointment right after work so I was just gonna wait in the waiting room. Nurse said I could come back with them. So, there I was, watching an ultrasound. They started hugging and kissing and crying and I was just...there.	0
Reddit, Do you live in a bad neighborhood? Whats the worst thing thats happened?	I mentioned this last week on reddit. I lived in a bad neighborhood in Brazil. They hanged a man on my street one time who was robbing money from a local street vendor.	33 comments and 8 total votes. Don't you guys realize that you have to upvote the thread if you want people to see your stories?	1
What were your 15 minutes of obscure fame?	I was on the Price Is Right. I got on stage and lost. Spun the Big Wheel and lost. Don't care, it was a life-long dream. One of the best days of my life.	I was on the cover of a local to my Midwest state magazine for hiking the Appalachian Trail. Most of the other through hikers I knew were asking what I had done differently since they were from that area and out there it's a lot more common to run into a through hiker but put here I'm the only person anyone knows who'd do something that "crazy".	1
What everyday loopholes should people know about?	If you're in a city and desperate, and there either aren't public bathrooms or there might as well not be, just go into a hotel and walk with purpose toward the back. Don't look around - you belong there, you're a guest, the bathrooms are for you - don't think twice. Also, I moved to a new city recently, and when I have a question about something local I call up a local luxury hotel and ask for the concierge and say "hi, I'm a hotel guest and I was hoping someone could help me figure out something to do tonight/ a salon/ a nice place to walk around/ bus times" or whatever. They never ask any personal questions, and are usually pretty helpful	When you order pizza online and add a $5+ tip ahead of time, the driver will see that and try deliver yours a little quicker than the guy who only tipped a dollar.	1
Funeral workers of reddit, what are some of the craziest stories you have of how people reacted during a funeral?	My step-mom was meeting my dad's family for the first time. Unfortunately, it was at the funeral for his grandfather. Great Grandpa was a funny old bastard from Czechoslovakia and lived in Omaha, which had a pretty huge Czech population. At one point, the family members come up one at a time to throw a flower into the open grave. It had been raining recently and my step-mom got too close and FELL INTO THE GRAVE. She was scrambling to get out but kept getting getting handfuls of mud. My family eventually helped, but only after they were able to stop laughing. Later, Great Grandpa's brothers shared their Becherovka with her and she was officially part of the family.	At my Dad's funeral, first of all, his wife got his middle name wrong in the obituary, she used her first husbands middle name. (not my Mom, obviously) Then, during the preachers sermon about how my Dad had found Jesus,(my Dad wasn't into religion , but his wife was) someone else fainted and they called the paramedics. The preacher just said, ok, they've got it under control and continued on with his sermon while the EMT's were preforming CPR on the person. I was more concerned about the person receiving medical attention than what the preacher was saying.	1
[Serious] Children of bad parents, what made them bad parents?	Sadly, after the first post, I realized that I cannot read this thread. I don't know if this sub does trigger warnings or not, but maybe you should add one? Or maybe I should've just used my head and realized a thread like this would be nothing but bad for me. Either way, I'll see myself out.	My father stopped talking with me entirely when he discovered I was gay. It's almost funny - just last week I accidentally sent $100 to his bank account instead of my checkings account, and had to call the bank about it. They were super confused why I didn't talk to my father, and I had to pull the " What if I didn't know who he was?" card before getting my money back.	0
What's the worst case of the butterfly effect that ever happened?	World War 2 wouldn't have happened were it not for a fieldmouse 2 million years ago eating one seed instead of the one adjacent to it.	If the Buffalo Bills had scored a touchdown in 1970, the Kardashians would had never became famous The Buffalo Bills barely lost a game in 1970 by missing on a bad pass for a touchdown. That loss allowed them to get the first pick in the draft, O.J. Simpson. OJ stays in Buffalo for awhile, meets his wife, then allegedly kills her. Then hiring Kardashians father to be his lawyer. They win the case, making the Kardashians somewhat famous. Then Kim drops the sex tape, becomes famous.	0
Reddit! What is the stupidest thing you've tried to blend with alcohol?	We've made Ultimate Arnold Palmers by mixing Mike's Harder Lemonades with Sweet Tea vodka. Delicious going down, not too terrible coming back up.	I don't know why I thought I'd say yum When It looked like a crackheads cum I took a drink of the cup And suddenly threw up Do not mix milk with rum	1
Ok Reddit, with all these "As Seen on TV" products being synonymous with poor quality, which of these products would you personally vouch for, and which were just absolute crap?	Glass. I see glass on my TV every damn day I look at it, and holy shit, that stuff is pretty damn glassy whenever I see it in real life. Seems like it might be of lower quality, but pretty close to what I see on my TV. I'd give it a 8.9/10.	My parents once procured a device known as a "titan peeler". In the ads, the fellow uses the peeler on such unpeelable objects as a squash and a pineapple. The peeler works as advertised. But also has an unquenchable thirst for blood. 5 out of 5 people who used it wound up bleeding due to nicking their fingers with it. The blade is beyond sharp, and due to size, the peeler is somewhat awkward, so catching your fingers is inevitable. The peeler has now been incarcerated for its violent crime spree, and parole is unlikely.	0
People of Reddit, what's your "I don't want you as a friend anymore" moments. When you realize that someone is not a good friend towards you?	When i make a joke about how his 3ds is small and not XL, he proceed to brag about the game he has inside, insulted me, shoved me with his fat body. I literally unfriend him right there and never talked to him.*He is also a shit person*	When you listen to everything that friend says, offer advice, etc. However, when you're talking, that same friend seems disinterested, or instead of keeping up in the conversation, they start talking about themselves again, as if what you had to say doesn't matter.	0
Redditors who have dated famous people before they were famous, what were they like?	Well it’s all about interests. Subscribe to emails to find out events, look on fb for events happening nearby and go to them, be outgoing when you’re there and go up to people, etc. you may have to travel an hour or so, but you’ll meet a lot of cool people, even friends!	I casually dated a professional athlete when we were both in college, before he got drafted. Contrary to the stereotype of most successful/popular college athletes, he was a total sweetheart and a really genuinely good guy. He still is like that today, even though he’s now rich and famous. We still keep in touch, and he’s still got a great head on his shoulders.	0
What made you feel like a badass as a kid?	I was a paperboy. I kept all my money in rolls of bills in a drawer. I didn't have a bank account and I didn't spend money so it accumulated. My parents were never really curious what I did with the money I earned. Now and then I'd open my drawer and look at all the rolls of bills and feel like Scarface surveying my empire. One day my dad was late for a golf game and came into my room to ask to borrow some money. "Sure, how much do you need?". "Would a hundred be too much?", was his reply. "Sure." I opened my drawer filled with cash, pulled out a roll and peeled off five twenties. His jaw went slack. "You made all that from your paper route?", he asked. "Yep." The next Saturday he took me to the bank and I opened a passbook savings account.	Drove big tractors as soon as we could reach the pedals. Our father, as most farmers do, taught and empowered us to do a lot of things my friends didn't. I knew how to change a tire and change the oil in a vehicle. So many things, so early in life, so much knowledge and experience.	1
What's something done in commercials/advertising you just can't stand?	When they use idiot little kids that the advertisers think are cute to deliver some stupid line that the advertisers think is cute. Hate that shit.	"Look at how great this product cleans while I wipe a spill off a formerly spotless surface." "Look at how well my razor shaves this already hairless leg." "Look at how our entire family dances in circles in the front yard, all holding hands, because we love our laundry detergent."	0
You are dropped penniless into a village in the middle of England in the year 1500. You maintain all your current knowledge. How would you make your way to the top?	I'm literate, fairly charismatic, only 21, speak English and French, have studied a little Latin (but could learn more if I applied myself). I'm a history major (who's focused on early modern Europe and the late middle ages) and am a skilled debater and writer. I'm going to the top, probably within the clergy at first. I'd become an Augustinian friar, use that to get a better education, and parlay that into a series of escalating posts with noble houses as a tutor and adviser. Basically, I'd take Martin Luther's route from penury to a court post, although without the whole Reforming bit (although I might piggyback on the English Reformation once Henry VIII starts that up). The goal is to become a lecturer at one of the more forward-thinking universities or gain a minor court position. I'd do really well, in short.	I'm Asian so they'll be like "who the fook is this guy?" and probably hang me from the nearest tree.	0
Programmers of reddit: what's your best "you've gotta be fucking kidding me" story?	I wrote a program for a DNA sequencer, but got hit by a malicious code injection attack when someone coded a virus into their DNA.	This was just a casual project for a game jam, but... One of the other coders thought I commented too much, and didn't put at as many comments in his code. Sure, fine, whatever, everybody's style is different and I'm not gonna fight over it. It turns out he wasn't willing to live and let live - he went through code I had already done and deleted nearly all of my comments.	0
Bisexuals who have dated both genders. What little differences surprised you?	Guy here. Men are way more fun, open, trusting, and are just fun to party and socialize with. Women are not trusting, a pain in the ass, talk too much about stupid shit, but are very fun to fuck.	This probably isn't surprising, but it's a lot easier to find men to date as a female bisexual. With straight dudes, being bi is a more or less a plus (though that also comes with it's own problems), with lesbians being bi is a pretty big minus. I haven't dated another bi person, though, hopefully they'd be more chill with it than the rest!	0
people who've participated in an orgy, at what point, if any, did things get awkward?	My wife and I went to a swingers club for the first time just before the pandemic. We meet a really cool couple that made us feel really comfortable and things heated up quickly. The limits we set were no intercourse and no oral. So I’m fingering his wife and he’s fingering mine and I reach over to hold my wife’s hand to make sure she’s doing ok and I hear “Um, wrong hand dude”. I had just tenderly held hands with the dude finger banging my wife. We had a good laugh and then got back to business.	At closing time I could not find my clothes or my date's clothes. It was winter and very cold outside and I experienced major shrinkage. My date started to laugh. We had to stop for gas and explaining why I was naked to the officer and his female partner was really difficult.	1
What is a total lie you some how got away with?	My friend and I were ransacking a construction site for signs to decorate his room with (we were 15) and before too long a cop pulls up and asks us what we were doing. My friend freezes up in fear (he was too young for a license), but I found a talent I never knew I had. Without skipping a beat, I thanked the officer for coming and explained that my dad was in charge of the site and had received reports that people were stealing from the site. He asked me to come and clear out some of the signs to keep them safe. The cop agreed that it was a problem, helped us load some of the signs, and thanked us for preventing theft before it occurred. TL;DR - I convinced the police to help me ransack a construction site.	not me but one of my friends rear ended someone then sped off. 2 blocks later the guy caught and my friend pulled over. They guy walked up and asked how he could rear end someone then just drive away. he said "wasn't me" and the guy believed it and left	1
Who is the worst person you have ever worked with?	I worked with a feminist who clearly climbed the ladder by being self-righteous all the time. Her ideas were horrible, and everyone knew it, but if you disagree it became a gender issue. It made work absolutely horrible. Also, her boyfriend (total pushover) was in senior management, and always gave into her bullshit.	I worked with a guy in a call centre who every 30 minutes at least would fart like a trooper, and I don't just mean like a normal fart, I mean like a tank had just crashed through the wall of the office fart.	0
What sucks about being a dude?	Everyone says you're the reason everything is wrong in the world, yet if not for us, you all would be living in tree huts, sleeping in a pile of stinky unwashed bodies, and chucking spears at monkeys for dinner.	Getting a boner in situations that are... less than acceptable. Edit: I now know more about random stranger's penises than I ever wanted to... thank you.	0
I just learned that my wife thinks I'm going to kill her. What in the world do I do?	I'm not bullshitting you man. You're in for a rough road ahead. Time to get a lawyer. Try to be as civil as you can and file for a separation. The shit is about to hit the fan. Now is not the time to be in denial.	Every other day there is a news story of a husband murdering his wife and/or kids. Are you going to? I don't know. Is it possible? Yes. Is it impossible? No. So her answering 'yes' to the question of 'is there a chance he could kill you' seems a statement of fact. Ofcourse there is a chance. Especially when it seems like you've got nothing else going in your life. Pro tip- it's always the husband.	1
Garbage men of Reddit, what's the craziest thing you've seen thrown out?	I'm not a garbage man, but I once threw out all of the presents my mom sent me and my family one Christmas, and the garbage man brought it all back and knocked on my door thinking there was some kind of mistake. I had to explain that I had intentionally thrown those items away.	Many years ago my mom came home with a trunkful of high quality but lightly used furniture she found next to a dumpster. We went back the next week only to see the big "Goodwill Donation Drop Off" sign on the dumpster... :s	0
Those who went through an arranged marriage, how did your relationship with your SO develop and at what point would you say that you began to "love" them?	I didn't even know this shit still existed. I'd be pretty pissed if my marriage was arranged. I'm just happy there arnt many negative responses on this thread.	My parents had an arranged marriage, my dad lived in America though, so my mom only saw him in person at the wedding and then for one week. He flew back and they wrote letters and got to know each other for 3 years while she was in medical school in Pakistan. They said that they fell in love around a year after marriage. They've had some ups and downs but they're still married 22 years later. It's really cute how they still try to surprise each other with little things and go on dates and stuff! It's nice that it worked out so well for them, I can't say the same for everyone though.	0
What would the child version of you be most excited to hear about you now?	That I’ve driven a couple of Ferraris. Also a bunch of Porsches, Astons, Maseratis, Bentleys, etc. But nothing feels as special as a Ferrari.	I Was doing road work, (cutting loops) and we needed to dry the road off, so I had a flame thrower just blasting the road on the highway. I think 8 year old me would have loved to know that flame thrower operation was in the future.	0
What was one thing your mom or dad said to you as a child just to fuck with with you that you believed for a very long time?	My mum told me the big green box was a box meant for all my drawings. She said that she would keep all my pictures forever, and told me how much she treasured them. One day I learnt at school that this big green box was the recycling bin.	They told me this story about a guy named Jesus, and how he was the "son of God". I believed them for a long time. Turns out he was just a celebrity carpenter.	1
Mechanics of Reddit, how can I spot your bullshit?	here's a tip: don't own a car. they're money pits. half the reason people think they need one is because the usa is so mired in car culture.	Car guy, here. First, get some knowledge on your own. If your car is a 1996 or later model, you can go to auto parts stores, where they will usually scan your car for free. I know autozone will. You'll get a "P" code (P0000) that you can google with your car's model to find forum discussion that usually identifies the problem. So if your code is telling you the O2 sensor is dead, and the mechanic suggests you need a new engine, you can call him on it. One other thing. A Flashing light is usually a *severe* problem that needs immediate attention. A solid light can usually be left alone until you're ready to fix it. If it's flashing, your chances of doing serious, permanent damage to the car are much higher.	0
What's the best thing you can teach me in 5 sentences?	You are not your thoughts. Your thoughts are simply something you perceive, like the sounds you hear and the things you see with your eyes. Start seeing your thoughts as just something you see and suddenly you can more easily break out of unhealthy thought patterns, and your compulsive thoughts cease to rule over you. Only you give them any power.	Do not blindly respect authority. True respect is earned. Teach your children that police are not their friends and are not here to protect them. If you must smoke, smoke weed. Cigarettes are dangerous.	1
If you could ban anything, what would you ban? Why?	Cyclists who bike on the streets. I can’t even count how often I was stuck behind one of those dicks because he thought the street belonged to him and I had no chance to pass him.	Companies make you sign in, in order to unsubscribe from their emails. Edit: I tried Elite Singles. Didn't enjoy it. And THIS^^ is what I have to do to completely cleanse my life from it.	0
What's the most "Single" thing you've done?	Worn the same set of pajamas for three days and nights in a row during a long weekend. That Monday I went into work and when I said hi to a coworker my voice wouldn't work and I realized I hadn't said a word out loud in 72 hours.	Well was in a 3 year and 1.5 year relationship...otherwise I've been a bit of a slut for a decade and some change since I was 14ish \(now 29\) Eaten cereal out of solo cups, walk around naked...all the time. Have misc jewelry/hair ties/clothes in a box under the bed from many a nights with floozies. I hung panties on the wall all throughout college XD I have a 4 monitor system in my room and living room for tv/gaming/sports/reddit :\) Probably a large majority of my daily activities I am not so proud of lolol I'll keep the embarassing ones to myself.	1
Dear Reddit, what did you recently discover?	It's called a cupboard because you put cups on a board EDIT: ITS CALLED A WARDROBE BECAUSE ITS A WARD FOR ROBES FUCK	Gaming on PC is much better than console, playing all my old console games on PC aswell as inside games that aren't available on console, control scheme is literally a billion times better, so customisable etc etc So much more freedom! My Xbox 360 is now in a drawer under my bed...	1
What little thing did you start to do that changed your life?	I used to avoid confrontation at all costs. I was afraid of the awkwardness, of appearing "mean" and making my friends and strangers feel bad. Now I speak up. I stand up for myself. Challenging people is not only healthy, it is sooo beneficial for the relationship (any and all!) if you do it with respect. I owe my lovely partner and my great job to my assertiveness.	I started going to church and tithing. I was kindof sortof raised Catholic and called bullshit on the whole religion thing at a pretty early age. In my 40s, my life wasn't going too great. I was getting by but just sort of existing. Then I discovered a church whose teachings I can actually get behind (for the most part). Since then I have a much better life. I have friends, I uncovered a medical issue that has been plaguing me all my life, I met and married an awesome woman and count my blessings every day.	1
What are some fun non computer/internet related hobbies/activities to pick up?	Learn how to build them and build one yourself. Whether you plan to use it for gaming or not, it is an extremely awarding experience.	Go for a walk. Go for a walk somewhere scenic. Now you're hiking! Go sleep in a tent and *then* go walking. Now you're camping and hiking! Bring a camera with you. Now you're a nature photographer!	0
If money wasn't an issue, I'd quit my job and be a carpenter. Reddit, if finances weren't a problem, what would you choose to do as a career?	I'd spend my time finding entry-level jobs for young people with learning or social disabilities. And housing for those not lucky enough to be a drug addict, an immigrant or pregnant.	I would love to be a blacksmith. I enjoy making things (even though I'm not very good at it) and being able to say "I'm a blacksmith" would be pretty cool because in all seriousness how many people can say that these days?	0
People who have a really dangerous job, how close have you been to dying/get hurt?	As electrician you take really often a shake of 220 Volt. It doesn't hurt if you take it for some milliseconds :P	My solvent tank once blew off a fitting in my lab. It's a C1D1 environment, so there was nothing that could make a spark and set it off, but it's still unsettling to be standing waste deep in gaseous butane. The alarm was going off, but proper procedure for me is to stay put until the fans clear the air out of the room. Opening the door and trying to get out would only let the butane out of the spark proof environment. It took about 5 minutes of standing in very flammable gas until the alarms dropped to where I could leave the room.	0
You have been darned to heck. What's it like there?	All the computers are decent gaming machines, but so filled to the brim with crapware (toolbars, coupon printers, Weatherbug, you name it) that they've been brought to their knees. And to make it even worse, admin access is restricted, but Steam is still installed, and you can install games, but they run like shit because of Weatherbug and all that bloat.	Mildly irritating inconveniences that don't cause *physical* pain. Whenever you wash your hands, your sleeves fall down and the cuffs get wet. No matter which direction you walk in, you're walking uphill. Your sock is constantly sliding down inside your shoe. The weather is cold enough for a jacket in the morning but boiling hot by midday. EDIT: I GET IT THE WEATHER IS SHIT IN AMERICA. Edit 2: And Melbourne.	0
What are some books that made you go "whoa" after reading them?	Asimov's short story "The Last Question." Also "The Great Divorce" by CS Lewis because of the way he deals with determinism, freedom, and time.	Ready player one. I was so amazed by that book. Dune was amazing too. Discworld are awesome books too, still reading through them	1
What is the least toxic, friendliest community on Reddit?	Any of the religious sites - r/islam, r/buddhism, r/christianity, very good and welcoming people and they're the polar opposite of the hate and immaturity of r/atheism	r/c25k. It's a community of people who can't run longer than one minute learning to run 5k and everyone is just incredibly nice	0
What are your blasphemous musical opinions?	Lady Gaga is a talentless hack who relies on gimmicks and Prince's music sucked so nothing of value was lost when he died.	Ever since the whole clear channel shit in the mid 90s, we're for the most part being spoon fed "hits" that have been pre chosen and have increasingly less musical merit as a lot of have been written or ghost written by the same small pool of producers. But throw it on a commercial bumper for a movie or good morning america and it's an instant fucking hit. So shut up and dance w- .... FUCK!	0
What's your weird/secret phobia?	It's not a secret, but vomiting is my phobia. There have been many nights where I've been sick or eaten something bad where simply vomiting it back up would have made me feel better and let me get to sleep. Instead, I sit or lie in bed for a few hours controlling my breathing so that vomiting isn't induced.	I get freaked the fuck out by long pieces of hair on or near my body. It stems from a childhood memory of coming home from the pool, and when I took off my suit my kid dick was blue because some hippy's hair dislodged and constricted the fuck out of my dick.	0
What's the most disappointing movie you've ever seen?	I absolutely loved the Alex Rider series in middle school. They finally adapted the first book into movie, and I was convinced it was gonna be the next Harry Potter or Twilight(in terms of popularity). Nope. Movie took the source material and shat on it. The movie isn’t good by its own right either. Even the author said he regrets having the movie made.	The Last Jedi it seemed pretty cool that Luke Skywalker was making his big return... but man did they run this series straight in to the ground. the choices they made in this movie were just indefensible. i shouldn't have gotten my hopes up because they clearly put forth zero effort while writing TFA.	1
What did you buy at a flea market that's worth a hell of a lot more than you paid for it?	A cute little clay statute of a whale. The artist's name is on it, I looked it up and she sells other similar works for $300 to $600. I paid $3. It sits on my dresser now, being adorable.	Pocket knives for all of my groomsmen. There were fairly cheap, but good quality. I woodburned they're initials into the handles. They may not be worth more money, but I know they're worth a lot to the individuals I gave them to.	1
[Serious] Teachers of reddit: Did a student ever offer you sex to pass a class? If yes, how did you react and what were the further consequences?	I've been a teacher now for 16 years. The first couple of years when a girl offered I turned it down but after putting up with this job for so long I gave in. Now if she's decent looking I tear that fresh snatch up	Yes. I was a teacher in rural West Africa for a few years. I had a few students approach me, and make an offer. I rejected them 100%, and had long conversations regarding how inappropriate and terrible this was. It didn't help that it was quite common for this to happen, and the same females that were approaching me were approaching the other teachers. At one of my schools, 2 girls became pregnant from teachers, which gets kinda ugly since pregnant girls are not allowed to be in school. We had faculty meetings where the principal would say verbatim, "OK, I need to tell all the teachers not to sleep with students." and the teachers would laugh and say, "But who are we supposed to sleep with?"....and everyone would chuckle and then discuss the next topic on the agenda.	0
Reddit, what is one "harmless" thing that creeps you out?	Older single women. I am sorry if I offend anyone but I just dont understand them. I hope I am not single when I am in my 40's+.	1. The high pitch noise that TV's (and some other electronics) make from the electricity running through them. I'll see if r/askscience can put a name to it, but I feel like a dog being messed with by a dogwhistle. 2.My grandma laughing at sexual humor on tv shows.	0
My wife and I coined the phrase "action casual" to describe anyone trying to look cool in an obviously physically taxing position. What descriptive words/phrases have you invented?	Friend invented "soberwhelming" - when you show up to a party and realize you're way more sober than anyone else.	My friends and I do a cabin trip every summer that we call "brofest". A few years ago our friend Jerry was being a little bitch and saying he was tired all the time. We invented the phrase "Once you're up you're up!" which basically means stop being a little bitch and lets go. Also applies to penis.	1
Deaf (born deaf) folks of Reddit. (Sorry if this question sounds crass) Does your inner self have a voice? When you think to yourself what does it sound like to you?	Not deaf, but that's an interesting question. Thinking about it right now, my "inner voice" doesn't have a pitch or a loudness. It does have inflections and pauses. Very much like speech that didn't make it out of my mouth. Staring off into the distance at nothing, I can get the "inner voice" to stop, yet, I still have thoughts that notice that no words are forming in my head. I can think about an object (say, a chair) and "see" a mental version of it. It can be manipulated, turned, painted, and visualized with a puppy on top. Yet another visual thought process plays mental movies of past events with various levels of detail. Several different levels of thought? It would also be interesting to hear from born-blind people about what they "see" when remembering past events.	I am Deaf since birth. When I see words in reddit or books, I usually see it in my head in sign language. Just hands moving around, usually with no arms or face. A frequent exception to "no arms or faces" is when I see these signs in my head in someone's "signing style." A good analogy of this on reddit would be "I heard this in X's voice" where X is some famous person.	0
Reddit, what was your best "fuck it" moment?	4 months ago I was sitting on my bed at 7:30 am, drinking shitty, warm vodka out of the bottle to curb withdrawals until lunch time so I could go get another half pint. Said "fuck this" and scheduled a doctor's appt, checked into detox that day. 118 days dry today.	Its 9am my senior year of high school. In about twenty minutes I'll say "fuck it" and walk out to my truck and go home.	1
Reddit, would you date a girl if she did not want to have sex before marriage?	i might...but considering the religious/political view that usually goes along with that, i think it'd be moot as i don't think we'd get along.	No, as if shes religious thats a deal breaker. I cant see any other reason for it. EDIT= There is nothing "moral" in wanting to wait, I see no reason for it at all. I'd much rather be with a girl who has some experience in these matters.	1
What are some of the dumbest rules you had in school?	We couldn't say bullets when talking about making a list in a word document, instead we had to say nuggets	Not being allowed to chew gum. What, were they afraid we would be so focused on chewing that the lesson would be lost on us?	1
NSFW Porn/nude models that did porn at a young age (18-25), do you regret it? How has it affected your every day life?	A few months ago, right after I turned 18, I tried webcam modeling for a few weeks. Made crazy fucking money and pretty much just showed guys my tits, it was awesome. I do kind of regret it now, especially because it was untaxed and I have a 1099 to deal with at the moment. Plus it made me feel kinda dirty.	I really dont think its anything to be ashamed of. If i ever have a kid that gets into porn i would support them. I think porn stars & prostitutes that are involved in those industries in a responsible way are valuable to our society. Obviously there are downsides to every industry...	1
Girls of Reddit, what's the female equivalent of trying to hide a boner?	I would say hiding a boner. For me, it is hiding a boner, cause I haven't had bottom surgery yet	Back in the days of bulky menstrual pads it was horrible when you didn't anchor it down quite right and suddenly you had a pad wedgie. Front or back. Both were a proper chore to adjust in the wild.	0
What pisses you off in music?	Anyone who claims to be a musician but cannot play some form of their music when the power goes out.	Having no self control and listening to music I love over and over again until I can't listen to it anymore.	0
[Serious] What's something you admire about another country or culture?	American here. Free university and healthcare seem pretty fucking awesome. Edit: no shit, not free, higher taxes and what have you. But shit, that seems worth it. Edit: no shit, it comes out of taxes. Is it really that bad? Would you prefer it how it is in the US?	In Spain the streets and squares are the hubs of social life in the evenings. Kids playing, teens with instruments, adults drinking and grandparents, they'll all be out, having fun, chatting with friends and meeting new people in the evenings. I think that's a great way of having a social life that is connected to your larger community.	0
Old Men of Reddit, Do You Find Women Your Age Hot? When Did You First Notice Your Attraction to Old Women?	You people have some fucked up definitions of old. I was like "good question, it will be fun hearing the perspective or redditors in their 50s and 60s" and i see these fucking 30 year olds commenting.	34, so you probably think I'm old. Young girls 18 - 26 or so are fun to look at but they really don't know what the fuck they are doing. So if I was going for a one night stand, yeah sure whatever. Women over 30 and yes up into 40's are still beautiful but are just done with other people's bullshit. They know what they want and who they are. So, if I wanted to date and have a relationship... I'd pick an older woman.	1
What seemingly normal thing freaked you out when you were a kid?	The shower. I thought that there was an octopus living in the pipes that would reach up its tentacles and try to eat my legs if I showered for too long. DAD	This one girl i know used to be shit scared of stairs, yet she lived at the top of a block of flats.	1
What violated your "willing suspension of disbelief" in a movie?	Just recently with Black Panther. When those terribly rendered CGI armored rhinos came into play during the last battle I was just *yanked* from the movie so fast it was like I was a fish on a line. 1) They were God Awful to look at. 2) The entire concept was so ridiculous I nearly laughed aloud.	Pretty much any movie where they break a guy's neck like it's a piece of celery. The old Star Trek is corny but at least Spock's nerve pinch makes sense within the Star Trek rules. In the new Star Trek TV show there's humans breaking Klingon warriors' necks like they're popsicle sticks.	0
What's the most you've seen someone be so out of touch with reality?	Ok. so I was 15, and working at McDonalds. I was at the back window where you take peoples money. A customer came, and blew past the back speaker where you order. That was pretty typical, so I figured it was just a normal mistake. When they get to my window it is the very old lady. She smiles at me, holds a grocery bag up, with frozen chicken and a two liter of soda. She holds out a 20$ bill and asks "how much for the chicken and soda?" 15 year old me didn't have the coping skills for this. I stared at her for what felt like forever. Finally I said "Uh, I think you're confused".. She drove off, with her car half way over the curb.	A friend of a friend. His parents bought him a $900K condo after he got evicted from his dorm room for too many write-ups. When I told him how fortunate he was, he said something along the lines of, "My dad has enough money to buy me a fucken villa by the beach, this is basically him slapping me in the face by making live next to all these people."	0
Medical Professionals of Reddit, what was the the most shocking or perplexing thing you have seen at work?	A woman who was in denial about her breast cancer let it go until it basically ate its way to the surface. By the time she came to us her breast had basically rotted off. Parts of her sternum were exposed. Ive worked as a wound care nurse for a long time that smell was by far the worst. Lots of horrible diabetic foot wounds. Ive taken off a sock or two only to have a toe fall right off.	I think the most perplexing thing is to watch other medical professionals post comments to posts like this. It’s exploitative of our patients and unprofessional. Everyone is vulnerable when they ail, these are not our stories to tell. What people are like when they seek medical or professional help should remain confidential, unless being used to train other professionals.	1
What are some of the unwritten laws of the girl code?	Always warn the next girl if she is about to walk into a stall with no toilet paper. Furthermore, always provide TP under the stall door should a girl find herself in the unfortunate situation. Always tell a girl if she has smeared makeup, crazy hair, lipstick on her teeth or what have you. Always warn your fellow girls if her skirt has gotten tucked into her underpants, a boob is about to make an appearance or any similar situation. That's all I can think of for now.	I'm a guy, but reading this is starting to piss me off. Quit assuming that 9/10 guys that are going to talk to you are creepers. Most of the time (and yes, MOST) it is just someone who's a bit awkward/introverted and they finally sacked up to talk to you, but because they may act a little "weird" you just discount them as being a creeper. Give somebody a fucking chance!	1
Virgins of Reddit, how old are you and why do you believe you haven't had sex?	I'm 35. I'm autistic and schizophrenic, so I've decided not to have kids. With the meds I take, I don't have a sex drive, anyway. I'm happy looking at a beautiful or cute woman, but I stay away. I can't maintaina a relationship, anyway. I can barely talk to human beings.	I am 32. My standards are very high and people in general irritate the hell out of me especially those who keep talking for the sake of talking. I'd rather be a virgin than annoyed. Also, I'm committed to having sex with the woman I marry...if that ever happens. If I die a virgin I really could give a shit less.	1
What's one food everyone seems to love but you hate?	I dislike those greasy fastfood pizzas that are loaded with shitty salami and fake mozzarella cheese, dripping fat everywhere. I know Reddit loves them. I'll rather pay more and go to an Italian restaurant around the corner to get a thin-crust margherita pizza out of a wood-fired stone oven. Costs me more and I might only get it once a month but in my opinion that's much better.	Celery. People tell me that it has nearly no flavour but when I eat it it is the strongest most bitter foul tasting thing I've ever eaten and it makes me unable to swallow it because my throat just constricts from the gagging until I spit it out. How the fuck is that nearly no flavour?! It tastes like poison.	0
My wife hit me again today, how is a introvertedman to deal with this?	Ask her if she thinks it would ever be acceptable for you to hit her. Chances are she'll say no. Then ask her why it's okay for her to hit you. If she acknowledges it isn't, ask her to please refrain from doing so in the future. If that line of questioning doesn't work, ask her if she would teach your kids to use hitting to express anger or solve problems. Perhaps get her some anger management classes and marriage counseling for the both of you.	> Would never hurt my wife, > though I recognize I say things that make her very upset. These two are pretty much diametrically opposed.	1
[NSFW] What is the hottest thing anyone has ever told you?	A women and I were drinking buddies, always play flirting with each other. She was always saying that if she were to cheat on her husband it would be with me and I was all, yeah, yeah... One night were in my car on the way to the bar and she says it again and instead of yeah, yeah... I say 'put up or shut up'. She says OK and in a second has my shorts unzipped and she's fingering me saying we need to find a spot. We pull on to a dirt road next to a canal and go at it. Whew!	*girlfriend unzips my pants at a traffic light and starts to stroke me* Me:"hun, people are gonna see" Her:"Well maybe I want to show off what I'm gonna be playing with when we get home" Sex was good afterwards 10/10.	0
What's the biggest mistake you made on your first job interview?	"Why should we hire you instead of anyone else?" "I don't even know who else you are interviewing with, how could I know that I'm better than them?" Led to a really awkward silence.	Accidentally got high before the interview (thought it was the day after) and when I did my interview I forgot what the place was so I started naming off places to the guy doing the interview. Actually got the job.	1
What was your real life "No time to explain! Don't ask questions and get in the car!" moment?	I snuck my phone into school one day and put it into a small, discreet pouch. It falls out, I notice but I can't sort it out because the teacher can see me from where she's sitting. So I pass it to my friend(friend 1) and tell her to get it to friend 2. Friend 1 grabs the phone (which is also wrapped up in a full on skirt. Long story) and the pouch, and shoves it into friend 2's crotch, whisper-yelling "PUT THE EGG IN THE NEST". Friend 2 freaks out, throws the skirt- with the phone in it- about six feet, as I face palm in the background. Not sure if this applies.	Fourth grade, my mom burst into my classroom, grabbed my hand, and told me not to ask questions and run. We sprinted into the main office, where my mom handed the secretary a note, then we made a dash for a waiting police car. We had to keep our heads down until the officer got onto the freeway and gave us the all clear. Come to find out her psycho husband went even more psycho, tried to kill her in front of a group of neighbors, attacked the neighbors when they intervened, then disappeared after threatening to go get a gun and finish us all off. We had to go into hiding until he was caught.	0
What's a good podcast to listen to while being bored as fuck in your cubicle at work?	The Adventure Zone is a ton of fun, but requires some level of concentration, and the ability to restrain laughter. Stuff you Missed in History class is also a lot of fun, and there's years of content.	Joe Rogan Experience. Yeah its kind of mainstream but he has tons of episodes with guests from every kind of branche you could imagine, and often there are really interesting guests and you always find an episode you would like. For example guys like steve o, b real ( cypress hill), a bunch of doctors, mma fighters, scientists etc., tommy chong, elon musk, kevin hart etc. Theres a large variety and often interesting conversations.	1
What is the single coolest thing that has ever happened to you?	I got the top comment on an askreddit post asking me what the single coolest thing that has ever happened to me was.	When I was 12 my dad was going on a trip to Germany to see our relatives still living in Germany (my great-grandmother immigrated to the US right after WWI). We were sending him off at the airport when I got called up to the desk. They had boarding passes for me. My dad had secretly packed my stuff and gotten tickets for me. They did a great job at keeping it secret because I was absolutely shocked. I ended cruising through Germany with my dad for about a month over the Summer. Got to eat in a castle, ride on the autobahn, meet awesome German relatives, go to Oktoberfest, and see Hamburg and Berlin. I'll always remember the "Holy shit! I'm going to Germany!" feeling after they gave me my boarding pass. Dad, you're freakin' awesome.	0
Reddit, what is your favorite song that tells a story?	Kyoto by Skrillex The lyrics are just so deep that sometimes I cry, and have to just pause it. The entire symphony of wub wub, tententen, and the epileptic seizure, is just tear dropping.	"Casimir Pulaski Day" by Sufjan Stevens. I can't link it because I'm on the mobile app but it's a sad story. He does mention god in it, but he does it in such a nice way. One of my favourite songs of all time, he's an amazing story teller.	0
To people who treated their pets like kids and then actually had kids, how did it change your relationship with your pet?	This title bugs me, every animal we should treat equal, you shouldn't view you're "pets" as pets, if you actually look and try to care you can see how smart and alive other animals are. Plus why treat anything below you? Everyone is equal.	The pets almost became like little surrogate adults. They knew better than to hurt the kids in any way, even if the kids were bothering them. If the pets were annoyed, they would just go to their own space, and occasionally give me a look like, "Annoying little shit, isn't he?" Ultimately, everyone loved everyone else, though.	0
Bartenders of Reddit; what is the most awkward encounter you witnessed between two drunk people flirting?	my second week at a restaurant bar and it was halloween night, this middle aged couple were hardcore mackin' in a booth while their offspring ran around the dining room	I cocktail bartend in a very wealthy part of Brisbane and I had a guy walk up to a chick, pulls ~$500 from his wallet grabs her arse and offers the cash to her to have sex with him in the bathrooms. She slapped him in the face and threw the drink I had just passed her at him. He is shocked for some reason, stalks off in a huff, about an hour later security throws them out for snorting coke and fucking in the bathrooms.	0
What is your made up unit of measurement and what does it measure?	I measure time in pregnancies. Say I get offered 18 month phone contract I automatically think to myself that I could have two babies before my contract runs out. I'm male.	To season something to completion or to add a new seasoning to finish the flavor we say 'just fuck it up with it'	1
My abusive mother was granted a restraining order against my father that also includes me and my siblings. She's already started in on the abuse today, less than 12 hours after my dad was forced to leave. What can I do to get her out of the situation/back in the custody of my father?	Go to the police station in person. You don't have food and she's been hitting you. Emphasize that you don't feel safe. Tell them about her mental health issues, and how this affects your family and their safety. Explain this calmly. Explain the false accusations against your father. Don't leave until something happens. Ask to speak to a social worker, head to a youth shelter, just GTFO with your siblings.	Absolutely nothing you can do. The law is on her side 100%. You can thank radical feminists who oppose men's rights like the freak show at SRS.	1
What's something you wish you could still find at the convenience shop?	Guns, like damn, yesterday I could just have my day and walk away with a lil baby glock, now I cant even have a single Beretta. Wtf	I remember random corner stores I'd visit as a little kid with my mom, and near the counter they'd have these little brown paper bags with a question mark drawn on them. The mystery bags would be about half full with suckers, penny-candies, a whistle, a spinny-top, etc. I once got a mini yo-yo and felt like I'd won the lottery.	0
What should Americans NOT do while visiting your country?	Bitch about how bad the climate is, or how dirty/unhygienic it is, especially if you are eating at restaurants. Please don't ask the servicemen to clean the plates one more time. Seriously, it was your choice to come here; you could have chosen a better destination to be at.	Singaporean here. Please don't compliment me for "speaking English so well". It's my first language, guys. Sometimes it's as if it's a mindblowing concept that Asian people can have a good grasp of the English language.	0
What is the weirdest fetish an SO had that you just went with because they were hot?	My ex wanted me to hold her down with kind of a rapey vibe. I found it repulsive to the point it was hard to perform... she had issues.	Met a girl with a perfectly tattooed pinwheel lollipop right in her armpit. As we're making out and things are getting hot, she says if you lick the lollipop I'll rock your fucking world. Hesitated for a sec, then said fuck it and went for it. Might as well have been eating her out because she absolutely loved it. Then rode me harder and better than any woman ever has	0
Why do you have that scar?	Fell into the underside of a lawnmower when I was 6 in a junk yard and landed against a bent blade.	Wanna know how I got these scars? My father, was a drinker...and a fiend. And one night, he goes off craaaazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen to defend herself. He doesnt like that. Not...one...bit. So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me, and he says, "Why so serious?". Comes at me with the knife, "Why so serious?!". Sticks the blade in my mouth, "Let's put a smile on that face." Aaaand, why so serious?	1
What is your proudest NSFW achievement?	When a girl I slept with on off told me I was in her top 3 favorite dicks. She got a round a lot so that defneitly smashed all self confidence issues.	I've been able to make three different girls cum on command, no other stimulation except words. My current girlfriend is so sensitive she'll do it without even being warmed up. Just say the magic word in her ear in public and her knees buckle. EDIT: Am I being downvoted for lying? Or because it sounds like I'm bragging? Because I'm not lying, and I thought bragging was the point of this post. :P	1
What's the stupidest thing you've said to your girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband?	I love my girlfriend's legs. Love, love, love them; they're awesome. So awesome, I called them "thunder thighs" because I thought that the phrase meant they're great. I have never been more wrong.	Over 1,000 comments, so I doubt this will be read, but I really want to put it out there, meant with the friendliest, most helpful intentions. I cannot believe the things I'm reading in here. Let me give you all some advice here: if saying most of these things actually caused fights with you SO, try dating someone with a sense of humor. This knows no gender, this applies to everyone. Lighten the fuck up, and be with people who can laugh at themselves. Trust me, you'll be happier for it.	1
German, Italian, and Japanese redditors, how was World War II taught to you in school?	German here. I remember being taught about the war crimes at a young age. That shit sticks with you. It's very taboo in Germany to do a Hitler Salute, print swastika's, etc.	In Japan, i learned that the United States refused to give us food, so we bombed them. Then they and China attacked us and won :(	1
Reddit, what is the earliest memory you have?	I was sitting on the floor with my Aunt Ruby, a dwarf, learning how to count with Skip Bo cards. I don't know how old I was, but I miss that woman. She also taught me how to read with the local newspaper.	My mother, red faced and in tears, screaming that she wished I'd never been born and calling me a big eared bastard. Then my dad trying to comfort me by telling me mummy was only joking because mummy loved me and we don't say things like that to people we love. I was very young, about 3 I think, but even then I knew she wasn't joking.	0
What are some accidental NSFW moments you've seen in public?	When I was in 8th grade, we took a bus trip from New England down to Washington D.C. On the way down, somebody on the other side of the bus spotted some guy that was driving by, butt naked and vigorously jacking off. It was quite the spectacle when I was only 13.	A middle aged woman had her period in a restaurant and she wasn't prepared for it. She had a white trouser and it turned red. I lost my appetite.	1
What's your r/NoSleep story that actually happened?	My house was brand new when my parents and I moved in. I am six months older then my house. When I was about 15 I was watching one of those Discovery channel "Haunted House" specials. This haunting was terrible because the house had been standing for 200 years, so it had generations of ghosts. For some reason I said, out loud, "New house means no ghost for me SUCK IT." I had one of those lamps with an adjustable neck and at that moment the neck swung violently down. So sharply, the lamp rocked on it's base. Edit: a letter I surrounded myself in a circle of salt and clutched a bible until my parents got home.	This one time I took a poop and then looked down at the toilet to find nothing. I'm still terrified.	1
Ladies of reddit, what is your period horror story?	Nature's worst mistake was to put adolescents at their most vulnerable at an age where their peers also happen to be giant dicks.	Got my period one day in middle school the one day I didn't bring a jacket to school. I was wearing a white long sleeve and khaki jeans. I felt pretty that day what I didn't know is that I had my period since the morning and it being a hot day I just thought the wet feeling was because of sweating from sitting most of the day. I had some shitty friends who couldn't be bothered to tell me I had red all on the back of my jeans. It wasn't until I was walking home after school that a nice older lady stopped me and told me. My "friends" laughed at me the next day saying when ever I bent down to pick up something all they saw was red.	0
What is your best way to kill time in an airport?	Play phone spy. Find a crowded waiting area. Choose a picture of your cat and Airdrop it to a random stranger. If you can identify the person who received your photo without them noticing you, you score a point.	Dissociate into a half sleeping daydream, after a bit it'll seem like a fake lucid dream. Or just meditate. I can spend literal hours just staring at a wall but inside my head I'm enjoying endless brilliant content my brain is producing for me at all times. It's like offline reddit.	1
Men of reddit, what is a compliment that you want to receive, but never get from Ladies?	If you see a bit of muscle on his forearms, even if its just a tiny bit of definition, make sure you point it out. We work hard for it and its nice to have someone acknowledge it	Any compliment followed by eye contact and a genuine smile will make a lot of men blush like a schoolgirl on the inside.	0
What's something that everyone loves that you absolutely hate?	Dogs. I hate them with my whole being. Why does every other human on the planet love them so much? I just don't get it.	That "why you gotta be so rude" song. I honestly don't care what it's about. The music drives me nuts.	0
Redditors who can get out of bed as soon as you wake up every morning, how do you do it?	Sleep is necessary, laying in bed is not. If the alarm goes off, I'm awake. What good does it do me to lay there and waste precious time that I could be spending getting ready for my day and then participating in it. I have 4 individuals in my family that could lay in bed/sleep all day. Such a waste. Life is not meant to be spent unconscious.	With the knowledge that if I leave it too late to leave the house, my 20 minute commute across the city quickly becomes a 60+ minute shit-show, inching along on my clutch while motherfucking cyclists weave around trying to get themselves killed.	0
If a stranger approached you and said “I know what you did”, what would be the first thing to come to your mind?	I was at Target and I had two apples in those weird plastic bags and I forgot to put them on the scanner for the Clerk to see and then I walked out of target forgetting to pay for those apples but I was in a hurry and I just drove off.	i didnt fuck my cat. i didnt cum on my cat. i didnt put my dick anywhere near my cat. Ive never done anything weird with my cats. I promised myself i wasnt going to make apology videos after last years thing so im just trying to be as short and honest with this as possible.	1
Russian Redditors, What opinions do politicians and media in Russia portray of America?	Traditionally Americans are viewed as an aggressive and malicious nation. However, the younger generation don't really believe it at this point.	Nyet, I can't speak. Mama would be much disappoint if I insulted our great proletarian leaders. Can't we just have vodka comrade, instead of insulting fellow gopniks.	1
What's your towns dark secret?	Little town in Michigan. Scientology is slowly buying up all our old and empty buildings. They don't do it under the name of Scientology, mind you. They're too smart for that. Instead they do it and open a ton of rehab facilities. If you're in a rehab program in the Midwest, chances are you go here. If you go here, you're doing Scientology rehab. Guess where that goes? Sinister, if you ask me. The town doesn't know or doesn't care - all these old Detroit looking husks are brightening up so no one cares. EDIT: Battle Creek, MI. Normally known for two things - the birthplace of cereal and seventh day Adventism. Interestingly enough, both with the Kellogg family at the heart. Now we're just the human trafficking capital of Michigan and Scientology is trying to make us their hub in the Midwest. Progress...?	This high school teacher got real desperate and actually started selling drugs. No one saw it coming. Last I heard some kids from his school vandalized his old house and he was found dead in the south valley. Scary shit. His wife and disabled son apparently had no clue.	1
Reddit, what's the worst superpower you can come up with?	The ability to transfer your need to poop to others. Won in a discussion between my friends and on this very subject.	My superpower is a passive ability. Every upvote I get shortens my lifespan by a month, so go ahead and kill me you fuckers.	1
Who else checks reddit during their morning routine as if it were the morning newspaper?	Me. I rarely take it to the shitter, but I do check the front page to see if anything wild happened in the world.	Everyone. That's why if you want to make the front page your best bet is to post between 7 am and 11am EDT.	0
What is common knowledge in your field, but if you told us, we would think your next level smart?	If you are afraid water is not disinfected properly, you can add approx 1/4 capful (1tablespoon) of bleach to 1 gallon of water, mix it, and allow it to rest for approximately 15-30 minutes and the water should have no bleach smell/taste, and a minuscule risk of disease. This helps if there is a natural disaster, water main break, or a loss of pressure. Once water pressure drops below 20psi, it is considered stagnant and unsafe.	Bridges aren't fixed at both sides, they're traditionally pinned on one side (with two big super-pins), and just rest unfixed at the other end. This helps avoid additional stress as the bridge flexes during use and expands/contracts with temperature change. Edit: spelling Also, thanks for the silver!!	0
If you could take control of one person for 24 hours who would it be, and what would you do?	Become my best friend and spend 24 h on behalf of myself, showing me how my personality and behavior affect other people- for better or for worse. I really needs someone to do this, as I am pushing away every person who slightly care about me.	Bill Gates. I'd transfer $100M into my account and sign a contract (as him) agreeing it can't be undone. Edit: Actually, Bill's cool. Maybe Zuckerberg...	0
Is it offensive to ask for a new biology partner, because my current one is too biased with her religious beliefs to do the work right?	Yeah talk I'd talk to the teacher, or just call her a close minded skank, so she will get pissed off and talk to the teacher	Ask your prof how you should handle the situation, explaining as you did above. This wont be the first--or last--person you will disagree with so it will be beneficial to learn how to work with them even if you think they have lost their damn mind.	0
What social situation happens only in movies?	Ladies in their 40's acting like frightened virgins at the idea of sex. Bitch, please ! The lady had had several thousand coïtus in her life already. She has strong opinion about what position she want to do, a routine to make someone happy, and 4 strange kinks you never heard off.	Say one line in a conversation, then travel across town together and say the next line of the conversation twenty minutes later while entering a new scene.	0
What animal fact ruined that species for you?	I had pet quails that had babies. When the babies were mature enough to tell which were male and female, the mum and dad quail along with their daughters attacked the only male baby. When I got back from work that day the quail had been pecked so many times its head was nothing but a skull. No eyes, no feathers, no skin yet still alive just standing there while the others would casually walk up to him and take another peck. Of course euthanasia was the only option.	They are SERIOUSLY the worst. They are responsible for murder, rape, and mass deaths among their species. Not even for a food substance... Just for fun. They wear other animals on them to achieve a higher status amongst themselves. They produce so much waste that it could be the sole reason the earth is getting warmer. They are tribal in nature but tend to be alone. They are selfish, and usually only help others if there is something in it for them (heaven). They invented Nukes and will kill thousands over the disagreement that a person in the sky is real or not. They steal, covet, and never have enough material possessions. Man is definitely my least favorite animal :/	1
People who became more *liberal* as they aged, what was the reason?	Fuck. Reading these comments is nauseating. You guys don't know the differences between political ideaologies, and economics, and this is really just one, big, circle jerk. Dummies.	I became a therapist and realized everyone is struggling. Every person has become valuable and vulnerable in my eyes and we all need compassion.	0
Hosts of Airbnb who was your worst guest?	A friend had a bnb in austria. He has tons of stories about arabs. They'll take dumps in the bathtub, since a toilet with toilet paper is deemed uncivilized. They'll also steal everything. Flatscreen not mounted at the wall? Alarm clock? WiFi router in the closet? Desk light? It all disappears into the rental car. Police has evicted them many times, and he now is fully booked when they ask. It also seems that English and Russians are people who drink too much and break everything. But at least they pay it.	Everything was great until the last night. She called and said the house was very warm and she didn't think she would be able to sleep that way. So I said just turn the AC on. I didn't hear anything back from her until the next morning. She said she could barely get through the night and it was so hot because the AC was broken. So I get home and notice that the AC unit was on and blowing cool air but she had moved the unit close to the bed and detached the exhaust hose so all the warm air was blowing out the back and into the room.	0
People of Reddit, what is the most brilliant cheating techniques you've ever witnessed at school/college?	Once I saw someone cheat by memorizing all the facts and methods they needed to use. I mean, it's brilliant! They've never ever got cought!	Probably the best way i have seen someone cheat took place in my high school spanish class. This one kid wrote answers on the waistband of his pants. He would periodically peek down at his pants and pull the waistband out a bit revealing what he had wrote. Soon the teacher noticed and asked him loudly what he was up to, thinking she had busted him. Without missing a beat the kid looks up and says to her, "I was actually just adjusting my boner, but thanks for calling me out." The entire class burst out laughing. The teacher had no way of responding to what was just said..Kid never got questioned about it again.	0
The last insult someone flung at you (either in jest or in anger) becomes your new superhero identity. Who are you and what are your powers?	No one likes you, he said that after I told him that his parents lost a bet w/ god and got him, and if I wanted to kill myself, then 8 would climb to his ego, then jump to his iq... I had to bust out some allo for his burns. ;)	Not accounting for playful insults like dickwad and other every-day roomie talk? Well I got pissed at someone in DOTA last night... ... So here comes the cock-gargling, cum-guzzling cancermancer	0
[Serious] What are the best jobs for people who hate people?	Farm worker, I could go for days without talking to anyone. You could go years without using much more than grunts and gestures to the handful of people around you. I have worked with people that just don't talk. I did three years with a bloke and got nothing more than grunts and nods till he got drunk one evening and we couldn't shut him up! He still didn't know my name it had only been three years.	Figure out how to get along with people. At least learn how to interact with and learn to carry a convo with them. Those skills go far	1
People who didn't have "a passion", how did you decide what to do with your life?	Passion is a funny thing. Everyone I know that had passion? They are no where. "I really like art." Ohhhh... well, drawing pictures really worked out for you, didn't it? What you doing now? Oh, that's right: stay at home mom that puts her meh drawings on Facebook. "I really like music!" Ohhhh... and, I see giving up real jobs so you can tour with your Dave Matthews Band cover band, how'd that go? Oh, still doing that and complaining about greedy rich people and posting about Bernie all day long, eh? "I'm going to make video games." Or, you know... work at a grocery store for 15 years. But, whatever.	Taking the SATs in high school 30 years ago, we had to fill out a form saying what we planned to major in. I turned to my friend sitting behind me and asked what he was going to say. He said Electrical Engineering, so that's what I wrote. Had no idea what that was, but EE turned out to be my major, and my career. No regrets.	0
What do you think the most ridiculous lyric line in any Top 40 song might be?	''Cause I'm looking at you through the glass... Don't know how much time has passed All I know is that it feels like forever' - Stone Sour Guy sounds like a damn stalker.	I throw my hands up in the air sometimes, saying "Heyyyy-oh, gotta let go" I just imagine some guy in line at the bank or something who has an uncontrollable urge to throw his hands up in the air and say that	0
Redditor's who have been kidnapped. How did it happen and how did you get rescued, escape ?	i have a vague memory of my kidnapping but when something this i was just a boy at the time walking in a park and two men came up to me and asked if i was lost. not having common sense at my young age i said yes then the two insisted that i should go in their car. the guys asked where i lived and i responded in a way i could. the guys kept their word to get me home, it could ended up worse but they were good people doing a good deed.but never saw them ever again i still wonder who those guys were..	Not me, but someone who worked in the same building as me was grabbed by a guy in our parking garage and put in the trunk of her car. She got away because he couldn't drive her stick shift.	0
If you could hit a reset button and turn yourself back into a 1 one year old with your adult mind, would you do it and why?	not in a million years,when i was young we had respect for our elders,people spoke more to each other,it was safer to play out in the streets,there was a smaller divide between rich and poor,and people were happier and less stressed,today's society is messed up..	Could you imagine being a one year old with all the knowledge you already have? I’d be a fake child prodigy.	0
Reddit, let's build a curriculum. What academic concepts should every high schooler know by the time they graduate?	I feel like Reddit should create their own standardized curriculum for a better functioning human and compile internet resources to teach these things.	I think schools should have a 'Real World' course. Something that teaches you about renting a house, mortgages, lines of credit, loans, buying a car, car insurance and other stuff of that nature.	0
Gay people of Reddit, what was your "Oh shit I'm gay" moment?	Once I was fucking my homie and during it my dog pulled my socks off, and after i finished i forgot to say no homo, also i accidentally accepted an invitation to be an r/dankmemes moderator and accidentally downloaded fortnite	It's kind of in three parts but the "oh shit" moment is obviously part three 11 years old - had a neighbor girl in her 20s that I """"admired"""" a lot for no good reason 14 years old - one of my friends was a bi girl and I really liked hanging out with her and one night I had a sex dream about her out of the blue. Also in hindsight I was never attracted to guys, I only liked getting attentions from guys for my ego 15 years old - Met a girl and crushed hard af and finally realized I liked girls. I thought I might be bi but I realized I never was attracted to guys later that same year.	0
Redditors who have ever hired homeless people with the "will work for food" signs, what was your experience like?	Most of these responses seem to be negative. I thought I would come in here and be pleasantly surprised. I guess homeless people are that way for a reason.	I've never hired a homeless man with a sign. I have been a homeless man but I was missing a sign. I approached home owners for doing some yard work. I was very happy with the pay I got. It was more than 0 which was more than I had. I recall one employer paying me 80 dollars for only an hour of work. I guess he assumed it would take me several hours. I'm fast. I was referred to his friends after that and was able to rent a home and get my self in a better situation sometime after. I was 19 at the time.	0
Today, while I walked back from lunch to the college I work at, I was bodily herded away from a group of school children as if I were a wild dog. What over the top ways have you seen adults act with or around children?	My wife is a school teacher and while she was working on her masters degree she had to do this project where she had to read and write a report on 100 children's books. We went to the library for her to pick out books and the plan was to read them there, but I guess there is a policy where no adults are allowed in the children's section without a child of their own. My wife was currently a teacher at the time and had her badge from work to prove it. The librarian didn't care. We had to sit at a desk just outside the children's section because there was some rule against creepers being around kids. My wife has four certifications, that she earned, that qualify her to be around children.	A lot of parents I know are super restrictive with diets. Lots of kids I know can't drink juice or have anything sweet. Edit: although to be fair kids on sugar can be fucking horrible	1
People who traveled the world. What did you choose not to say about a country you visited to keep the story positive?	Israel...you get to see street-hawkers sell AKs and other guns China...when we went shopping, all items were made in China lol. India is such a shithole...people living on the streets, shitting/pissing in public is ok but no kissing in public. And scamsters everywhere.	The train stations in Rome are filled with teenage pickpockets. Two different groups made attempts at us in 5 minutes. It was actually fun to watch once we realized their strategy.	0
[Serious] What do you genuinely believe, but hide from everyone because they will judge you for those beliefs?	That women in western nations are given preferential treatment, have life far too easy and we are giving them far too much of a leg up without them having to work for it. This is all in the name of "gender equality", which creates a sense of entitlement and positive discrimination while solving absolutely nothing - all we've done is flip the original sexism round the other way. "Women in Business", "Girl Geek", "Top Female XYZ Of The Year" etc. is to be celebrated. Do that to celebrate male achievements and it instantly becomes sexist and reprehensible.	In my darkest moments, I feel as though I've settled for everything in my life. I've got nothing I want; I have only what I could get.	0
What items or styles of clothing are your biggest turn on?	Oh man. I went to a public school but the prefects had to wear dress shoes, button up, a tie and a blazer. At the end of the school day, this boy I sat next to would unbutton the top two, loosen his tie and roll up his sleeves. He was a swimmer and had some great arms. I was into it, just one more thing to look forward to at the end of the day	Let's face it. Most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're cavemen. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing eight-inch heels. And to be wearing see-through underpants. But for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.	1
I have seen some crazy things working 3rd shift at Walmart in the past 4 years. What are some of the strangest, most unusual things you've seen at department stores?	Technically this was never seen. Once when I was in walmart there was a particularly rough thunderstorm going on. I knew it was only a matter of time.... I put several footballs in my cart and kept walking along until BOOM! The power went out, it was only out for a few seconds until the generators kicked in but it was long enough for me to throw 3 footballs as hard as I could at the tv's. I broke it	One time, I saw a dude who had cut a hole out of a watermelon and was quite literally attempting to have sex with it. I watched for about 10 minutes, at least until he got arrested. Sometimes I wonder what the valiant watermelon fucker is doing these days...	0
What is something that is actually cheap that most people think is expensive?	Truffle oil. It's not made with any actual truffles since they found a way synthetically create it's active flavor compounds. As such some chefs have refused to use it while others are taking full advantage of it to pad restaurant profits.	Dates. I've had the most fun just going for walks or having a picnic. It's more personal, you don't have a bunch of strangers around you or a waiter interrupting. Some girls do prefer the boring old cliche date; restaurant and a movie. You don't want these girls. Going to the movies is too expensive and you learn absolutely nothing about each other. Edit: I don't mind dinner and a movie guys, but it's far from cheap! holy crap, I didn't know reddit was that passionate about restaurants and movie theatres	1
Teachers of reddit, what was the most NSFW thing that ever happened at work?	School what memories i remeber this one time i was getting a pass to go to the bathroom and i ended up not going to the one that was closest to me because i wanted to waste time ( as usual ) so i went to the bathroom just below the library and took a leak when i go to wash my hands i hear paper towel being ripped and a soft moan of a girl right then im thinking oh shit is someone fucking and i stand there listing i look under and i see two pair of legs i dont look over the stall beacuse i think il let them have their privacy so i walk out and a few min later i see a redhead and skinny dude walk out and that's it	Not a teacher, but my AP psych teacher in HS once told me a story where he walked to the back of the room in a remedial class he was teaching with another teacher, and saw a kid with his hard dick out getting a handjob, while fingering the girl giving it to him. They refused to leave. The girl said she wanted to finish the job...	0
How many live bumblebees would you take in your anus at $100000 American per bee?	At some point you'd have to physically restrain me to prevent me from shoving fistfuls of live bees up my ass.	Since you didn't stipulate that they had to be put directly into the anus unprotected I'd contrive some sort of hardened tube that could be inserted far into the rectum while protecting the intestinal walls from stings. Once that's in place, I'd pack as many bees into the tube as possible within the rules. If they only need to go in alive but can die once past the anus then I'd pack the tube tightly with dead bees. Otherwise I'd put in as many as possible while still allowing the bees to survive.	1
What is the smartest thing you have seen an animal do?	My cat can operate the recliner, turn on/off the faucet, open doors, turn off lights, and defeat her food dispenser (she found the button that dispenses regardless of the timer). At this point, it's like having a fat, furry roommate.	Convince humans to feed and house it and not only watch it poo, but then have the humans willingly pick up the poo with their hands. All in exchange for letting the humans touch it.	1
What's your worst "oh shit, I just did/said that in front of a kid" moment?	I got really really drunk at a family reunion one time staggering all over the place. Ended up having a conversation with my little nephew (8 years old) and the conversation turned to sex pretty quickly. He was asking me all sorts of questions like, "Where do you put your penis?", "Have you ever had sex with a man?", "Do people put their penis in bums?" ect. So, in my defence, he was really curious and was the one asking all the questions, I was just giving him lots of detailed answers. Anyways, my aunt walked up behind us just as I was explaining anal and she was not to pleased. I tried to explain, but I was too drunk and ashamed. My family loves that story.	me in high school, dropping off trees to an older person with little kids. we went to smoke in the basement, half way through a bowl the 3 year old walks down stairs, catches us smoking but doesnt know whats happening. looks me straight in the eyes, I just said I had to leave and walked out.	1
If I get cut off by a driver and they wave, then I don't mind. what are the small things that make a big difference to you?	no one ever says "bless you" to me when i sneeze and that makes me feel good because i am an athiest.	While driving, I once cut off a little old lady. She pulled up next to me at the next traffic light. I sheepishly looked at her, and she wagged a finger at me. We both laughed. That was probably three decades ago, and I still remember her fondly.	0
Flight attendants, what's the most embarrassing/best mile high club story you have from travelers?	Not a mile high club per se but one time the gf and me did it on the roof of her building.	After highschool went to San Fran with the love of my life. On the way home we decided had to at least give it a go. So we picked a bathroom and went one at a time. Just like everyone else says it's terrible. No space and then walls. So we settled in a kinda make shift doggie style. Can't remember if either if us even came it was so damn uncomfortable. Then it was time to leave. We planned it to leave one at a time and space it out. Problem is while we were busy a line formed of three people waiting for bathroom! Two women and just looked away and the one was a dude who just had a huge smile on his face. Great trip.	0
Reddit, You have 60min to get rid of a murder weapon. What do you do?	Just drive down the block and drop it off. I was a public defender for 5 years, you'd be surprised how little police actually look for evidence. This isn't TV.	Depends on the weapon lol If it is a gun, then wipe it down, bleach it, file off the serial number and then throw it in the river, or if no water then bury it deep. If we are talking something bigger like a car or heavy machinery....well your kinda fucked	1
What do you think will be officially banned in 10 years?	Tanning salons. In my country anyway (Australia). Our government has started to restrict who can use tanning beds and how often and we've had a couple of really big cases where tanning bed users have developed skin cancer from using them and have passed away. One woman before she died headed a very public campaign against using them. Edit: I've received quite a few messages informing me they have already been banned, beginning in 2015. I've also had a few angry messages about personal freedoms. I do agree. I also see it from our government's position however. Healthcare is free and this is an avoidable burden to the state (much like the effects of smoking).	Boxing. Is it really a sport to pummel each other until someone falls down from a concussion. A sport with a well linked association to brain damage and early death. It seems to be fading, hopefully it will go away.	1
What stupid shit did you use to do with the school computers?	On the last day of our senior year, my friends and I went to one of the computer laboratories and we decided to trim our pubes and put some of it under the keys of the keyboard. I think one of my friends also wiped his smegma on some of the keys.	Draw random crap really fast in Kid Pix then hit undo a million times with the speakers on so all you could hear was "OH NO! OH NO! OH NO! OH NO!"	0
Reddit, I can not tie a balloon. What seemingly simple tasks do you find impossible to complete?	I can't sign my name unless I want to look like a 4 year old, so I just write the first letter of my name and some squiggly lines.	I've got a friend who is incapable of doing a lot of simple things. I'll list them from not weird to weirdest (in my opinion) Pushups whistle click wink (she looks like she has tourettes when she tries) EDIT: Can't click her fingers, but probably can't do her tongue either.	1
[Serious] Germans of Reddit, what's your opinion on the refugee situation?	I'm quite late to the party and probably no one will read this but I think it has to be said: It is rediculous that there are so many EU-member-states that refuse to take more than a few thousand refugees. These persons are refugees because of wars the USA started and which we participated. Not welcoming those refugees is in my opinion just refusing to accept the consequences of stupid behaviour in world politics. Ninja Edit: Of course those refugees should follow the rules and don't break any laws.	I volunteer german lessons to refugees sometimes. All that I've worked with so far have been kind and thankful for the opportunity to escape the hell on earth that syria has become. However, if you can't or won't accept our societal values (women's rights, rule of law, etc, separation of church and state) you can go right back. I support Germany beeing welcoming to all refugees, as long as they behave. Wanna live and stay here? Don't commit violent crime. Not letting any in is the same as tacitly sentencing thousands of innocents to death. I'd like to believe that we've grown beyond entertaining such notions as a society by now.	0
What is the most socially unacceptable thing about you?	My back and chest are just covered in acne. I have no idea why, I'm a healthy person, 14, 130 lbs relatively good looking besides the acne :/	I don't show it, but I always have to be better than other people at something. I get really upset when somebody is more intelligent than me in certain subjects.	0
I've been in a secret war with a guy over a parking spot for about 3 months now. Reddit, have you ever had a secret/unspoken war with someone?	This was funny as hell XD Me and another poster have waged psychological war on each other for the past 5~6 years on the gpotato forums. I dont know how he pulled it off but he was eventually able to get my fiancee to leave me for him. He finally called his victory for me and dumped my exfiancee 2 months later. I hate him so much id beat him unconcious if i ever met him, but this has been going on for years. He's pissed that im smarter and wittier than him but he found out I'm a lover and hes a sociopath so he attacked my heart and won. :/ Cheapshit little bastard.	Me and my roommate Steve. For the first 4 months we lived together. We decided to alternate buy toilet paper for the apartment. He bought 18 rolls his first time, Charmin. I bought 18 rolls of Angel Soft. This wasn't good enough so he refused to buy toilet paper until I got more, b/c 18 rolls of Charmin is 'worth more' then 18 rolls of Angel Soft. During these 4 months we would barely use our bath room. I would sneak my own private stash of toilet paper in there with my towel to shower in the morning. Other then that, I/we went at work. I still don't know how Steve went number 2 during this fight.	0
What is something you saw, that you'll never forget?	"Warriors sweep Cavs to win 2018 NBA Championship, Durant named Finals MVP" I subscribe to NBA League Pass and watch all the games the next morning. Even though I have it set to "no spoilers" that was the pop up banner displayed on the page when I tried to log in this morning.	A one year old baby at the bottom of a pool. Idiot parents nowhere to be found, of course. They had their boys, about ages 6-8 watching her in the pool. Everyone in the pool seemed to notice at the same time, and she was rescued in time.	0
People of reddit, what lie have you told a kid just to mess with them?	I don't lie, I straight up crush their dreams and fantasies by saying 'Santa Claus doesn't exist, and there is no tooth fairy because your parents put the money there'	I told them I was a robot, and "proved" it by doing math in my head. They were in second grade, I was in college, and about the hardest problem they could think up was "What's a thousand plus a thousand?" The robotics program over at the college is doing some very impressive things, I told them.	0
Parents of Reddit, what is a situation you've had to punish your child for but were secretly trying not to laugh?	Not a parent, but my parents like telling people this story about my sister. First time the tooth fairy visited me, my younger sister was upset that she didn't receive any money as well. Later that afternoon my mum found her in the backyard trying to knock her teeth out with a building block. Tooth Fairy had to leave her a note under the pillow that night saying they only collect teeth that have fallen out naturally.	Obligatory, not a parent but me as a kid. I tried to make breakfast for my fish. This entailed me getting up at like 4 AM and making a mess out of the kitchen with eggs, spilled milk, and flour. I was trying to make pancakes. I woke my parents up when I crawled into their bed soaking wet. I ended up killing all but one fish, which we gave to my grandfather. I don't remember how they punished me but I'm sure they were dying of laughter on the inside when they realized what I had done.	1
I recently saw an ad thanking me for not installing adblock which reminded me to install adblock. What kind of advertisement backfires have you heard of?	A few foreign language mishaps are always pretty funny. One I can specifically remember when I took spanish in school was a milk company who wanted to advertise in Spain printed on a billboard: "¿Tienes leche?" Which from an English speaker looks like "Got Milk?" , but in native Spanish directly translates to "Are you lactating ?". This didn't go over so well when there was a milk mustache on the billboard. Also when they tried to advertise the Chevy "Nova" in Spain, which "No-va" in spanish translates to "doesn't go." Needless to say it was not a big seller.	The anti-piracy ads in the beginning of DVDs, where they show a guy trying to pirate a movie and waiting for the download to finish while the people who bought the DVD are already watching it. Except that I bought the DVD and now I'm forced to watch (or fast forward through) an ad about piracy, whereas if I had pirated the film I'd be watching it straight away.	0
What's the creepiest or most unexplainable paranormal thing that's happened to you?	I woke up one night with the worst stomach pain I've ever had. I jammed for the toilet of course. After a couple of minutes of desperately trying to poop, all of a sudden I got the chills and shakes and all my limbs started going numb. It was probably some physiological issue, but it also could have been demons. I will never know for sure.	When I was a kid I used to sit on the counter and watch my mom cook. She had this birth mark on her arm that I was always pointing out. She told me it was her birth mark and I had asked if I had one. She said that she looked all over me, but I didn't have one. I was jealous and somewhat sad I didn't have one... I thought they made people special. One morning she was waking me up for school and she screamed. Her birth mark was gone, and it had appeared on me, in the same place, and the exact same shape. The only people that know about it is my mom, dad, and me. I ask my dad about it occasionally and he still to this day says "that was the weirdest shit I've ever seen in my entire life".	0
I want to make sure my computer is running on top form. Can you tell me what I can do to do so?	Easy... Download a linux distro (ubuntu is user friendly) and get rid of windows crap and start booting up with linux... Easy as that	First step: add legs. Next: remove all the crapware that the manufacturer installed. then remove all the crapware you installed that you don't use. after that, go into MSCONFIG and stop everything from starting that you a) know what it is and b) don't need it to be running when you turn on your computer. don't mess with the registry (registry cleaners are bullshit). you may also be able to add memory or get a faster hard drive to boost the hardware too.	0
What's the most ridiculous thing ever said by a public figure?	"You can keep your coverage, you can keep your doctor" "I didn't raise taxes once" "The vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country.'' "Even though most people agree... I'm presenting a fair deal, the fact that they don't take it means that I should somehow do a Jedi mind-meld with these folks and convince them to do what’s right." -Barack Obama President of the United States of Earf	"It says that I wanted to eat her pussy. I've never said that in my life to her, I would never do that. I'm happily married. I've got more than enough to eat at home." - Rob Ford. Actually anything that comes out of Rob Ford's mouth is ridiculous.	0
What's the longest book you've ever read front to back?	King James bible. It's basically the super extended version of the new revisions. While it had it's moments, after finishing it i was more sure God didn't exist. What a load of shit.	Crime and Punishment. After I finished it, I read a bunch of discussions on it and realized that I apparently missed the entire point. I mainly just read Star Wars books now.	0
Hey Reddit, What do you hate unreasonably?	Asian tourists. Let me explain my semi-racism. I work at a tourist attraction, taking guests photos at different locations and trying to sell the photos as they leave. At least two times a week tour busses full of Asian tourists come through. 99% of the time they don't want me to take their picture, which I am okay with. My problem is when they all line up behind one another and take at least 5 pictures of each other, clogging up the line at the entrance and causing me to not only get their pictures, but also any other guests who come in.	Dropping something 2+ times consecutively. Once, I can handle, but if I try pick that motherfucker back up and drop it again, you can bet I'll punt it across the room.	0
Who has invested thousands of hours on something and then given up? Why did you give up?	I grew up playing piano. My parents would make me attend competitions and I would do pretty well. For some reason I decided I hated it around 20 years old and didn't touch a piano for ten years -- lost all my finger dexterity and can't really play at all anymore. Definitely regret.	I feel like giving up on life in general. Ive tried to kill myself before but havent had the courage to actually do it yet.	1
All men are taught "don't stick your dick in crazy". People who get fucked by guys - what's happened when you've let crazy stick it's dick in you?	It was a wild fun crazy ride. I got to know lots of police officers. I learned a lot about the justice system. I can tell the difference between drunk and a dissociative state now.	you do realize your asking women to recount things like the time that they were beaten and held at knife point in their apartment bathroom while the police negotiated release, right?	1
Why is USA so obsessed with work that taking days off/sick days that they have earned is looked down upon?	I take the days that I want off, fuck them. That's my attitude. If I have the hours then I do it. There's more to life than work.	Because Capitalists run the country. They own the government and the media so they can push their agendas - that is, pushing The Poors until their backs break underneath their bricks of gold, then tossing them to a privatized, pay-to-live health care system until they expire.	1
Fit people of reddit, what do you think when you see very unfit people?	Honestly, it's my biggest prejudice. It takes minimal time and effort to maintain a moderate level of fitness. Obesity is gross and unacceptable, there are very few good excuses for it. Excuses are like assh*les, we all have one and they all stink. Also I am an ass, I know this. You do not need to tell me or downvote me.	Having become fit rather recently after being overweight for ~7-8 years, the immediate feeling is sorrow. Not because I think they're weak, that they need my sympathy or anything like that. But because I can really relate to how the vast majority of overweight feel on the inside. How immensly hard the task is. How much the thought of "you're ugly", "you're worthless", "you're lazy", "why can't you change? you're hopeless" is ruining you on the inside. Making you weaker and weaker until you can't bare the thought of working out. Knowing what's wrong and what you need to do, but never finding the lasting strength to get through it. It's such a horrible feeling I wouldn't want anyone to have to feel. It dominates everything.	0
What is the most bizarre situation you've been in?	I hosted a party at my house and sent an invitation to all of my facebook friends with the message "invite whoever you want". Ended up getting too drunk and passed out in my bed. I woke up in the morning with a splitting headache and a horrible feeling in my stomach that I was about to walk out into a disaster zone. The whole house was spotless, all the drinks had been cleared up and the carpet had been vacuumed. The guests who stayed over had cleaned up everything without my help. It was very unusual but in the best possible way.	I was in my room door closed earbuds in watching hentai and then my dad barged in aggressively saying give me the phone I was freaking out hiding the screen from him I will exited out of the video telling him I'll give the phone in a minute after he ripped out of my hands a second after I exited out he took my phone saw the home screen and said what was I watching I said a YouTube video and gave me a look and left giving me my phone back then I chased after him showing him a random video saying this is what I was watching he gave me and angry look and walked away I was so afraid cause maybe he looked at the streaming history on the router till his day i don't know why he wanted my phone	1
Reddit, what's the hardest part about dating you?	I have an entire list for that actually: * I hate kissing * I hate eating ass and I will not do it * I hate conversation * I hate explaining how I feel * my dick * I hate intamacy * I hate cuddling * I'm hard to please * I'm rather mean * I'm not willing to share my food or money with you * I don't want to hear about your day nor do i care * I hate attention That's most of it 🤔🤔🤔	I can't date you until we're friends first. But then once we become friends I'm afraid to ask you out because we're friends	0
People who have scumbag family members, what have they done?	When my grandmother passed away I thought it was right to ask my aging grandfather if I could have his awesome car when he eventually passed away. I mean, he only had two grandkids and it was a Gran Torino and I was in high school and everyone would think I was so boss driving it around. This asshole gives it to some Vietnamese kid that he literally had met like 2 weeks before. It was so super messed up because grandpa had been a total racist all his life. No wonder we never went visit him.	I have a cousin who was in a car accident and suffered severe injuries. Another cousin held a big fundraiser to raise money to help with her medical bills, raised a couple thousand dollars and then decided to keep it herself. Last I heard injured cousin said she would never speak to her again.	0
What's the most unhealthy thing that society encourages us to do?	Believing that there is a creator and practicing a religion accordingly. Children are born as atheists and if they weren't brainwashed by their parents/society, they would still be the same all around the world, from Middle East to Texas. Before Edit: I am ready for the down votes! Make it rain! :)	Not think critically or for ourselves. Today is a very interesting time for the world. The fake news is a problem, but that's been around for ages. People need to learn how to think, not what to think. If you don't know that an article is fake research. Put in effort. This censoring fake news is bad because people will need to think "less"	0
People who lived before the internet: what information did you struggle to get back then that would be really easy to find now?	Heh. Song lyrics. You could get almost anything else at the library, or you knew someone who knew someone. But wha that line is in *Stairway to Heaven* was the subject of many a late night argument.	Back in my day, we mostly rempucked with the spinter when we needed a terringo thort-mummer. (That's like a clown or something. Google it.) We couldn't just epper on the frilt, though, of course: Rechinning took *caravant* in those days, with a lot of shammy wilt and tenk dumpster. Then the world went and got itself in a right timpy. Nowadays, it's an urdle to wengast the most obscure detail, and a chemdurg isn't the ferronacks fumper. **TL;DR: Google made the wurgle lon mare connected.**	1
What never fails to make you sleepy?	Benadryl. took some the other day with it knowing it makes you drowsy and then proceeded to fall asleep 30 minutes later instead of being productive whoops	The tv show How its Made, the narrator in that show was super soothing to me, and when I used to watch it, I’d fall asleep almost every time within minutes.	0
My visit to the USA has gone horribly wrong, can you help me turn it around?	To save money while traveling From DC you can take Bolt Bus or Mega Bus to NYC/Boston/Baltimore for like $10-$25	PRO TIP FROM AMERICAN MAN: I've been much happier with my Euro-woman than I ever was with all the American women who preceded her.	1
Girls of Reddit, what sort of hints do you drop to guys to let them know that you're interested?	My boyfriend and I, before we got together, kept magically getting to the bus stop at the same time. Our timetables coincided nicely, but I did occasionally have to miss the very first bus that turned up in order to make it happen.	God, this type of question again.. I wish there was a reddit for adults or something. I'm tired of this teenage shit	1
Those of you who shit the walls on public toilets, why do you do it?	About 1 in 85000 Americans has a bifurcated anus. That means that instead of one hole in the middle of the butt, I have two anuses, one embedded in each of my butt cheeks. This means that, rather than poop directly into the toilet, the poop comes straight out of my butt cheeks and coats whatever I'm sitting on. I rely on other people to then get the poop into the toilet. It's a serious disability, but it would be great if people were a bit more understanding.	This question has been asked so many times and I don't think we've every had a wall-shitter actually respond. I have come to the conclusion that the people who shit and piss all over public bathrooms probably can't read......although my husband's cousin was proud of what he called "rocking the toilets" in public places. He'd shove as much toilet paper as he could into the bowl and then flush, causing floods. He thought he was really cool. He did it at my husband's house once (before we were dating). This guy was a thick-necked male stripper who has spent his entire adult life cheating on his wife and being an all-around douche.	0
What's a good off brand item that's just like the "real" thing?	The generic greeting cards at the Dollar Store I buy for one dollar are just as good, or sometimes better, than Hallmark's for $4-6 each.	Off brand power supplies for your computer. Way better than the real deal. I never pay over $20 for my psu's! /s	1
How many of us are famous IRL, but use reddit incognito?	I am an exec producer of a sitcom that a bunch of you like a lot. Not BBT or HIMYM.	I'm a fairly famous musician, probably on the scale of a Josh Homme or Kim Thayil. If you listen to that kind of music, you *probably* know me. It's a comfortable level of famous.	1
Have you ever left a subreddit because it was too toxic? What was it?	r/Canada. The level of racism was too high. Now I hear the main mod is some kind of Aryan brotherhood member it all makes sense.	r/woooosh, many of the jokes werent even funny in the first place and it was clear that the person understood the joke but it was just so shit, however, a sub to substitute this is r/im14andthisiswoooosh Edit: im14andthisiswoooosh link had typo	0
What is a social faux pas in your culture that is not seen as such in other cultures?	Canada, letting people die from easily preventable diseases, while spending more money than you would with universal healthcare on people through subsidies. Also, pretending that the rich are the middle class's personal bank account.	Blocking pavements. I don't get it but foreigners seem to be okay standing around in groups on narrow streets. In the UK the only people who do that are chavs and tourists. Both considered unacceptable to locals.	0
What little everyday thing makes you happy?	Elderly people who want to chat with me in the public transportation. Afterwards, I always feel like, this day, I was useful to someone.	It doesn't make me really happy nor is it every day but sometimes there's a girl on the bus which I'd like to get to know but I'm too afraid of talking to her.	1
What is the strangest way that you have been woken up?	Long time I ago I had a sleepover with a friend, who used glasses. In middle of a night, his N64 controller fell down from a tv-table and landed on my face. When I woke up, I had his pair of glasses in my hand.	I literally sneezed myself awake once. The funny thing was that it really left me feeling refreshed, and I had a pretty good day overall if I recall correctly.	0
I got sick of hearing the loud guy upstairs, so I put "Who Let the Dogs Out?" by Baja Men on loop for hours and just left. What things have you done when driven to the edge?	How about knocking on the guy's door and asking him to be quiet. I live in an apartment building and get carried away with music/movies/vidya from time to time. If my neighbor asks me to turn it down, regardless of their tone, I turn it down. You are deliberately being a dick on purpose.	Had a housemate when I was at university who was an absolute jerk and a pig. Ate us out of food repeatedly, never had money to buy any himself, never respected anyone else's belongings or space, had no boundaries whatsoever. One night the other housemate and I cooked up a pot of tinned dog food with some herbs, spices and laxatives and then left it to cool on the stove top and went out. Sure enough, ate the lot...	0
What had so much potential but instead was just really bad?	The movie scene in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows pt 2 where Harry kills Voldemort. That scene in the book is so satisfying with all the dialogue and everyone watching it go down. In the movie they like make out and Voldemort turns into evil confetti.	I'm probably going to get downvoted for saying this but screw it. I'm gonna have to say Star Wars The Force Awakens. I was so pumped for an exciting new Star Wars movie that helped expand the lore of the universe and show what happened in 30 years since ROTJ. Instead what we got was a plagiarized version of A New Hope with unidentifiable characters and just a generally predicable story.	1
What video game had potential to be great... but wasn't?	Skyrim. It had so much potential with its open world/dungeon exploration but literally every other aspect of the game was terrible apart from character creation.	Advent rising for sure. This was a game that gave you crazy psychic powers and had an intriguing story line. There was also a million dollar prize offered to the first person to decode their riddles placed throughout the game. Well day one the game had come out and a good number of people already solved all the riddles. The developer claimed there was some vulnerability in Xbox live that allowed people to figure it out too fast, and they gave those people 2 free games instead of a million dollars. Nobody bought the game after the prize was canceled due to the media disaster and they never made the rest of the series. Oh and the first game ended on a cliffhanger.	0
When lightning strikes a body of water, do fish die? And at what distance are you safe from electrocution?	Lightning striking a body of water instantaneously kills all fish in the ocean but only for two seconds. Then they spontaneously come back from the dead...	The electrical current is spread out in all directions and the severity decreases rapidly. I would imagine that if a fish was relatively near to the bolt in the water then it may die.	0
What's your most NSFW family moment?	My uncle cheated on my aunt with her brother's wife for a while about 17/18 years ago. Nobody outside of those 4 people know except me and my eldest cousin because my aunt got drunk one family reunion and told us. Everyone thinks the 2 families just hate eachother for some petty reason. What makes it worse is my aunt has a child who is turning 18 who looks nothing like his dad but strikingly similar to my other uncle. Yet nobody has ever mentioned anything and we have never brought it up. TL;DR My cousin might be my cousin!	My brother forced himself on me. I won't elaborate further. Added for further clarification: I'm not making any of this up. I mention I won't elaborate simply because if I posted without it, someone would've asked about it anyway. That being said, I'm sorry a bunch of you are really butthurt about my decision to keep the details to myself. Added again: I'd like to thank all the people who've messaged me with kind words. Thanks for being good people. Last addition: I just want to express how shocking and disgusted I am by some of the responses I continue to get. I hope some of these people find some humanity in their lives because they sure as hell don't have it today.	1
Adult Redditors, are you still in contact with friends you had in high school and college?	I'm still in contact with 2 people from high school which are my buddies and we hang out and do nerdy shit together. Did I mention that non of these 2 were from my class? Yeah, fuck those guys. Bunch of ignorant "I'm better than you" pricks.	My best friend from college and I see each other for a week every year when he visits me here in the east coast, he lives in SF. We're both 65.	0
What's something people say that makes them unconditionally appear ignorant?	"I HAVE FREE SPEECH!" as a retort to being told their (likely also ignorant) opinion makes them an asshole-- or to anything except being censored by the government, really.	You can't actually expect to deport all illegal Immigrants. Illegal Immigrants should be allowed to stay in the US. Children of Illegals are US citizens. I'm voting for Hillary or Bernie	1
Reddit: admit it, what is something that you just do not understand?	I cannot comprehend the size of the universe I cannot understand the human mind And I can't get fucking 10th grade math right.	People that waste huge amounts of money as a status symbol. Like the retards literally pouring hundreds of thousands down the drain in the form of expensive champagne. Motherfucker you could have provided water, tools and mosquito nets for an entire poverty stricken African town for that money. You could have send a shitload of poor kids to university for that money. Fuck at least buy a car or house or something. But no because your daddy and mommy are rich and you have no concept of money, your own priviledge and how others live you just fucking throw it away and it makes you feel good and shit. Fuck you, you prick.	1
What is the weirdest supernatural experience you've had?	Talking to a Ghost who happen to be in my room, Her name was Polly, died of old age of 89. And shit I Got a lot of questions answered. Dang, I wasn't really scared but more fascinated by what I can get answers too. P.S. Apparently she didn't know that ghost can poses people, and I told her to tried it, and she did. Cool Right?	When I was kid, there was a room in the back of the house I never liked to be in. I hated how I felt when I was in there but it was set up as my toy room. One night, I decided to play in there and I would see quick shadow movement go past the windows. All of a sudden, the light outside by the door that's in the toy room turns on. I never heard the light switch come on or anything. I got so freaked out that I ran out the room. Years later, I find out that a little boy died in the house we lived in.	0
What is your favorite pick up one liner?	Hey girl, I heard your socks are having a party. Why don't you invite your pants down? Would never use it, I just think it's funny.	"Do you want to have sex with me? No? Rape it is then!" Edit: nobody said it needed to be socially acceptable...	1
What's something cool that your ancestors have done?	My Grandfather fought in WW2 against Nazis. In-general, we Greeks invented Democracy and we were the center of the world for couple of centuries.	My family apparently has a monument somewhere in the mountains of China. Etched in the monument is the name of the first son of each generation. I'm #23 on the monument. Just like Jordan.	0
Poor people of Reddit, What do rich people do not seem to understand?	That there is no outside help if you fall down. If you live paycheck to paycheck or are poor in general, one life disaster can completely devastate your life. Many people in these situations do not have family/friend support systems they can fall back on during tough times. Either your family/friends are poor too or don't care to help. It's crazy how many people just assume there is always someone to help you out.	Trying to heat the flat for winter and still smoke weed everyday. *what do rich people seem to not understand?	1
Whats the most fucked up conversation you've eavesdropped in on?	Following an oil field worker walking down an aisle in Target with a giant bag of cat litter over his shoulder holding his young daughter's hand while loudly yelling in his cell phone: "....yeah well he got all whiskey drunk, passed out, and got his legs chopped off by a train...no, train tore 'em all up like hamburger meat....I don't know...guess we'll get 'em a skateboard."	Heard someone praying that they God would take their unborn child if only they would save their grandfather from death's door. I spoke with them years later about it, they afterwards had a miscarriage and it fucked up them, and the positive relationship they had with God before.	1
PhD's of Reddit, Add "Harry Potter and the" to the beginning of your thesis title, What is the new book's storyline?	Harry Potter and the Communist Manifesto, redone. Harry is sent to a gulag where he dies on the 3rd page. The rest of the pages are blank.	Harry Potter and the Influence of the Malleus Malificarum on English Witch Trials of the 16th Century. Ron’s fucking around with a time turner accidentally sends the gang back to 1520. As they are carrying wands, Ron, Harry and Hermione are put in trial for witchcraft. Thanks to Hermoine’s quick reading of the seminal tome by Heinrich Kramer She realizes the book was actually written by Death Eaters. Harry uses a reveal spell and saves the day.	0
I (23/m) really enjoy staying at home alone during weekends. Family starts worrying about it - is it really that uncommon or am I that strange?	You're asking Reddit if it's normal or not to stay at home alone during the weekends? That's like asking Cinnabon if it's ok to like frosting.	you want people to validate your boring life. challenge yourself and go do some interesting shit. you'll never remember an individual night you spent reading alone. you'll remember times you spent with others. edit: this isn't a subjective statement. people who socialize more live longer. fuck your correlation/causation argument: the fact that you want to dispute the statement proves you're insecure about your shitty life. discomfort is good: it's called hormesis. i'm not an extrovert, i'm just against supporting introverts as they lead lives that are absolutely pointless. you know what's a lot more dynamic and thought provoking than a book? a fucking person. reddit's going to be biased to support you, op, but you need to look at yourself and understand that you only asked this question because you realize something you're doing is probably not right.	1
This weekend I unknowingly prevented someone I don't know from committing suicide with a random act of kindness. Has anyone else gone out of their way for no reason and had it help someone more than you intended?	I was at a party and a friend of mine was telling me how she liked this one guy. I went and told him that she liked him, because I always wished someone would tell me that sort of thing. they got married a couple years later.	My best friend is very much in love with walrus's. For some reason I took him to the aquarium for his 22nd birthday and they were supposed to have walrus's there. Well yeah about that, they had an infection in the tank, and they were gone for the next week. He was really sad because he couldn't see them and they were his favorite part. Because he was sad, I had to cheer him up so we went to a baseball game, this one time I saw a famous football player at a game and was so confused So i asked him why he wasn't playing football, like at the Superbowl I'm so glad the giants won.	1
Guys, what's the most obvious hint from a girl you've missed?	Well you see... this one girl told me that she was crazy. Pretty big hint but I totally missed it. She ended up slashing her wrists, throwing a stick through my window, and running around the city stark naked. Should have paid attention to the hints. *I know that this isn't the type of hint you mean. This question just comes up so often I thought I'd appropriately answer the question without appropriately answering the question. Cheers.*	When I was in middle school this one cheerleader was "totally in love with me". I found out decades later at a reunion. She was always touching me and laughing at anything I said and always just staring at me. My only thought at that age was, wow, girls show friendship in very weird ways. But..... whatever.	0
Non-Americans of reddit: Where are you from, and what is your view of the of the gun laws in the United States?	UK: It's ridiculous. We have strict gun laws, so we have much less gun crime. Just burn the second amendment already, it's the best thing, even if the horde of mental gun nuts on Reddit disagree.	Wales. I've never seen a gun of any kind. Not even the police carry them. America has all kinds of random people, I'd carry a gun incase one of the nutters come out of no where	0
In America, if your loved one gets hospitalized, rushed to surgery, and dies, do you still get saddled with the bill?	Yes. The debt falls to your estate. If they think the debt is worth as much or more than your estate, your children/family will get nothing. Because US hospitals are insane, the kind of situation you're describing would likely leave you well over $20,000 in debt.	You don't get saddled with it, but the person's estate will. It then becomes the responsibility of the deceased's Will Executor to take care of.	0
Women of reddit, what is your "nice girls finish last" story?	"Nice" people, in the sense you're talking about, are often anything but nice. They are either manipulative or they are pushovers/doormats. Kind, caring, sensitive, thoughtful, confident, strong people never finish "last."	I had spent a year building up the confidence of my ex boyfriend who was extremely insecure. Consistently reinforcing him that he is attractive, smart, worthy of any women's time, you know, stuff a girlfriend should do for their partners. He left me for the girl he thought he never had a chance with because in his words, " You made me feel like I could do anything I want." I did not realize that involved doing other girls too.	0
Reddit, what's the most satisfying sound you can think of?	Farts. Makes me laugh every time. Oh... and the rain. Thunder storms to be exact. So powerful. So... powerful O_O	The sound of ''powering down'' ... when a noisy and complex piece of machinery is switched off after completeing its task, and all the moving parts gradually slow down and become quieter and lower pitched until it is still and silent	0
Aliens visit and take you to their ship and you experience the most amazing hour of your life. A living dream where all your fantasies come alive. They offer you the chance to live out your natural life with them. You have 24 hours - gather your stuff and leave forever. Do you go?	no. its fun for awhile but having everything your heart desires is horrible life is about the surprise the risk the gamle thats what makes these things fun in the first place	My partner would fit into my suitcase. The more important question though: was this just a "too good to be true" testing hour or would it always be like that?	0
What's the hottest thing your SO has ever done?	I had just started dating her and we were attending a frat party off campus. A few too many beers into the night and the frat guy she was chatting with began talking shit about me and she hit him in the face. I've never had someone fight for me before. I've also never gone from flaccid to fully torqued so quickly.	I have a foot fetish so it was the time when she shoved her entire foot in my mouth without me asking for it.	1
I was in the emergency room last night, drunk and covered in blood, when I started playing peek-a-boo with a baby, and the parents thought it was hilarious. Does anyone else have tales where parents were way more chill than you expected them to be?	What were you gonna do? Run with the baby? You were drunk and bleeding how fast were you gonna run anyway.	When I was 15 or so, this little kid, eight or nine, on my bus route kept asking me to come over and play video games. We were the last two stops on the route so eventually one day I just stayed on for another stop. He said that he told his mom that I was coming over. Turns out he didn't and his mom walked into his room to find her son playing Twisted Metal with some guy twice his age. We went into the kitchen and I told her that he'd been asking me to hang out for weeks and that my mom would be here to pick me up later. She told me that he didn't have many friends and that I was welcome to hang out whenever.	0
Reddit, in what ways are you a hypocrite?	I berate people for driving drunk because they might hurt themselves. I don't care what happens if I drive drunk.	Anything involving driving basically. If I do something stupid or dickish, it's justified because of [insert flimsy rationalization here]. Another driver does something stupid, he's just an idiot cunt asshole dumbshit incompetent fucktard.	0
What clichés are you sick of seeing in movies and on TV?	The inevitable love interest sub story. This especially made me angry when it happened in Hunger Games. It wasn't necessary at all, and honestly would've been a better movie without it. I kind of understand the satire they had where as the game show within the movie created it for more views, but I just think it went too far.	When people break up because they see their significant other in a compromising position, which is totally innocent, but looks bad and does not let them explain themselves.	0
Everytime you press a button, you get 1,000,000$ but you have 1/100 chance of dying. How many times would you press it?	1. Cross your figers and press the button once. You will need proof that it works. 2. Trade someone the button for being the sole benefactor of their estate. 3. Tell them they get a million dollars for each press. Don't tell them about the dying part. 4. Wait for your millions.	A 1% chance of dying each time I hot the button? Fuck, I would keep the button forever and only hit it when I need another million. 1% chance... HA! That's like no chance at all.	1
Reddit, what was your "That was close..." moment?	About 5 years ago, I was traveling at night in rural east Texas heading to Austin to hang out with a friend. The road I was on was just two lane with a narrow shoulder on wither side. I was traveling behind one other car at about 70 MPH. That car suddenly decided to slam on it's brakes to make a left turn. I had to swerve to miss him and my truck started fishtailing all over the road. I finally recovered and made it to the next town where I came down off the adrenaline. The only thing that kept me from dying was that there was no oncoming car in the other lane.	I was on a patrol (rear security) when all of the ANP's (Afghan National Police) started running away from me. Turns out I was standing on a 200 pound IED. Luckily it was command wire meaning somebody had to be there to press the button but they must have been on break.	0
You will get $10 million cash but Samuel L Jackson will be there to shout "motherfucker" for every dollar you spend, will you be happy? And Why?	If you just invest it, never touch it, and just spend the actual capital gains/interest does that count as spending the dollars for the motherfuckers?	No, because Samuel L Jackson is the most overrated actor to have ever existed and ruins practically 95% of the movies he is in, save pulp fiction and snakes on a plane.	1
What do you hate most about spending the night (or longer) at someone else’s house?	I was going through a rough patch and a friend let me stay at her and her husband's house. They were great, invited me places. Were cool with just hanging out. Gave me a whole room. Space in the fridge. Didn't even charge me. I spent every minute I could away from that house and trying to avoid being around them. I'd pop in to sleep, and leave asap in the morning for work. I felt I was intruding on their life, even though they said they were cool with having me around and I believe them. It just felt wrong. We've grown closer afterwards though, so that's nice.	I hate if it's a "no shoes indoors" house. Every time I go in or out it drives me battier.	1
Have you had a dream that messed up your day because you thought it was real and you woke up feeling horrible?	I have had, on several occasions, dreams of myself painfully waking up, followed by my normal morning routine, all in a bleary eyed state. Brushing my teeth, eating some crummy cereal, the shocking cold air after a shower. All of this only to wake up and have to do it all over again! I've also dreamt that I've fallen to my death. Usually, like most people I think, I'll wake up right before impact, but I have experienced a 'post-death' feeling, where I am conscious that I am dead. I remember thinking "Hey, this is alright, I am dead, but I'm okay." Woke up with an eerie feeling that lingered for the rest of the day.	Oh God yes! I was hoping someone else reacted this strongly to dreams. I have bad dreams about an ex all the time. They're bad because it's usually me just cuddling with her, or kissing, and they seem so real that when I wake up I feel bad because they aren't real. I actually broke up with her because in a dream she said, "I don't know when, and I don't know how, but I'm going to leave you one day." Talk about a self-fulfilling prophecy. I have other dreams about other people that are more disturbing that usually ruin my day, too. Fucking dreams. How do they work? ;D	1
Why the hell does anyone program their website to automatically play music? Isn't this universally hated?	Because they think it's like tv, where you digest media at their pace, not your own. They don't seem to understand that media consumption online is about moving at the consumer's pace and guiding them.	Do you consider it annoying on a band's website? I feel like that shouldn't be as inappropriate. Edit: Downvotes for a question. That's really lame.	1
Parents of Reddit, how did your kids find out Santa isn't real?	Relevant story: My brother is very trusting by nature, so believed longer than most kids do. He was about to go into 5th grade and my parents were worried he'd get made fun of for believing, so sat him down and told him Santa wasn't real. Apparently he was a bit sad but took it well. He then asked about the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy, and got the answers on those. The kicker though is that after all that, he turned then with tears in his eyes and asked "Mom...is Thomas Jefferson real?"	I have endeavored to never give the impression that Santa *is* real, and to gently disabuse my son of the notion when he picks it up at school. To me, it's fucking insane to lie to your kids about stuff like this. What a huge betrayal of the trust our kids have in us.	1
Suppose I am in a line of a few cars (say 5), driving on the highway in the left lane. All are traveling 15 mph over the posted speed limit. If we pass a speed trap, which position in the line is more likely to get stopped by the police?	From a good friend of mine who is a cop: we just throw the lights on and take whoever stops first. You're all over-thinking it.	I WAS the first car, in the left lane speeding past a cop. There was only one other guy following me and he had been for some time. As soon as we passed the cop, I got into the right lane, slowed way down and was prepared to be pulled over. To my surprise, the cop pulled over the guy behind me instead. I should note that the guy behind me was a cunt! he was one of those people who want to pass you, even if you're going quite fast, just for the fuck of it! He was riding my ass a lot of the time, so when the cop pulled him over instead, I was quite content. This happened about a year ago, on I-75 North around Bradenton, FL. We were going about 95 in a 70. If you were the guy, haha and fuck you!	1
What is the most annoying kind of Redditor?	The ones who spam. I mod a sub where this one dude has created at least 15 alts to try and promote his YouTube channel, and since i don't have permissions to edit Automod or ban the bitch theres nothing i can do but manually remove all his posts. Oh and fuck you inactive head mod!	It's a toss up between SJW's and MRA's. You're both asshats who are distorting issues. Present the kernel of truth and leave it at that, don't overstate your case and damage the cause for the times there is a real issue.	1
To those Redditors who are good at mental math, can you explain what goes on in your head when you solve a math problem like 32x17?	Mental arithmetic has always been my 'party trick'. For 32 x 17, I immediately know 32 x 20 is 640, then I subtract the 96 (32 x 3) to get 544. This takes under a second in real time. Unfortunately I am yet to work out how to monetize this ability.	Break down into components and solve for multiplication then add... 32 x 10 =320 30 x 7 = 210 2 x 7 = 14 Add then to get 544	0
If you knew you were going to die, what is the last thing you would do immediately before your death?	Do the everythin you havnt done... be prostitue run around naked as long as its daring and something i would never do.	Poop and/or pee. Everyone knows you void your bowels when you die and I don't wanna have a big 'ol shit in my pants.	0
Americans of reddit, what do you find weird about Europeans?	When I lived in Italy years ago I thought it was interesting that every day at 12am some of the local channels would turn into a video of a girl touching herself with a bunch of phone numbers on the screen.	Nothing really. I find Americans to be the weird ones. Europeans were here first, they have been living their way for literally thousands of years. Easiest thing to do in Europe is spot an American.	1
Truckers of Reddit, what is something you have witnessed driving at night that gave you chills?	I25 south of Albuquerque, there's a huge dip, straight down one side of a canyon and up the other. I'm a very safe driver, so i took the downgrade slow and crawled up the other side with my hazards on. Looking in my mirror i see headlights from another truck at the bottom, then 2 jets of flame shoot like 20 feet into the air above it. This truck runs past me doing 80 up the slope. I didn't even know it was possible to put nitrous into a semi, i know it ain't legal, but i thought the devil himself was riding up on me.	I love how half or more of these start off with not a trucker but....what don’t you mother fuckers get ! It says truckers of reddit not all yiu non truckers of Reddit	1
Fellow teachers of reddit: what's something your students have said that required all of your strength to not hit them?	Refused to do his work, and looked me in the eye and said "you can't fail me." Which unfortunately given our system policies, is absolutely true.	Not one, but two of my students threatened to tell their parents about our afternoon "tutor" sessions and it would have ruined my marriage and my life. I threatened real quick, but didnt actually hit them.	1
[Serious] What is one smell that you will always recognize and always give you a burst of emotion?	I smelled my late grandmas perfume in public once and started bawling. That was a rough rest of the day.	Moms cigarettes. Still not sure what she smoked. She kept it secretive. I only saw her smoking once or twice. But I could smell it on her all the time. The smell is comforting. Homie. Safe. I dunno, I like it. It's a burst of pleasant calm. The smell of bird guts makes me sad, because the last time I saw my uncle we had gone quail hunting, and we had cleaned our kills. Uncle is dead now. First girlfriends shampoo. Many hours spent spooning on the couch "watching" movies. It makes me feel giddy and excited, and horny.	1
What "NSFW fact" do you know about someone who is famous?	Kanye West is gay or at least bi It's a little known secret among the celebrity circle. It's been known that he's slept with several men	Tom Cruise wanted to bang Scarlett Johansson (long-term banging) and offered her the lead role in M:i:3 as a guise to lure her into the Scientology cult. He arranged a meeting for her at a secluded place and took her on a tour of the place, introducing her to various members holding higher position and according to ScarJo, didn't even offer her as much as a cookie the entire time. She was young and was intimidated by the event that she told her agent to back out of the deal and when Cruise and party called them to move forward with a contract or something, they never heard back.	0
Reddit, what's your best "Good Guy Greg" moment?	I try to be a generous person as often as possible, but perhaps my proudest moment was helping a lost kid find his parents at Los Angeles International Airport.	Alright fags, listen up. Open-book exam last semester, we were allowed to bring one sheet of paper to put all the info we needed on. Slacker in class sat next to me. Slacker in class didn't bring shit. We start the simple exam and as I'm half-way through tearing that shit up, I notice that slacker hasn't written down shit since we've started. I kick it right the fuck into super saiyan mode and slap that bitch around until I'm done in 25 seconds flat. Slide the cheat sheet over to slacker as I'm getting up to hand in the exam, walk past him at the exit where we were sitting, slightest headnod you will ever see came out of that guy. I saved his ass that day and couldn't give two fucks of a corncob, I've never said a word to him before either.	1
Former addicts of Reddit, what do they not tell you about sober life?	It's less fun and sucks, and the only reason anyone does it is to survive longer than you would as an addict.	People say it's wonderfull, you get your life together and everything is sugar and rainbow. Sobriety is a bitch, being an addict is like taking your life and smashing it to the ground in a million pieces, being sober is like picking up the pieces one by one, trying to fix the whole thing, but it's endless, you're an emotionnal mess, psychologically, you're barely there, and you bitch while trying to get the whole thing together, you keep bitching "WHY do i even bother, it sucks", but if you hold on to it, if you keep pushing it, after a while you'll overlook all the things that you've done and finally say "Yep, it was worth it". It takes a while to get over to the happy part of being sober, took me months.	0
Is the feminine voice that many gay men seem to have something that they do intentionally, or is it their natural speaking voice? If it's intentional, why? If it's their natural speaking voice, why don't more heterosexual men speak this way?	Whether the "accent" is put on intentionally, or unconsciously, I have heard from nurses and doctors that men who have the accent do *not* have it when they are waking up from anesthesia. It usually only takes them a few minutes to get it back, but categorically if they are unconscious, they don't have it automatically when waking up.	Ive actually never met a gay man with that sort of voice. And being gay, Ive met a few in my time. Maybe a minority have it. Straight men do too though, they just probably do more to hide it. whereas with gay men, the same tone might be considered more socially acceptable. But like I said, ive never met anyone who spoke that way. I think it might be exaggerated significantly in media.	1
What was banned in your school because of a crazy incident?	In high school a friend of mine was voluntarily cleaning a closet out for a teacher for extra credit and decided it would be hilarious to climb into the dropped ceiling, scale across a pipe to the middle of the classroom, pop his head out, and sing the spiderman themesong from the 60s. Now there is a statement, in bold, in the student code of conduct for broward county, banning students from climbing in the ceilings. He, to this day takes pride for that.	Not an "accident" really, but the kids in my school liked to throw the sliced pickles from the deli sandwiches so that they would stick to the ceiling. After that, no more pickles for anybody, even the good kids who never even *looked* at a pickle with the intention of throwing it:(	1
What TV character/personality do you hate?	Margaery Tyrell. I hope Cersei destroys that fake little bitch. It amazes me though how people take her seriously as a good person who cares about anything beyond being a queen.	The plucky hero who is "down and out" even though they are attractive, live in a nice house, have nice clothes, and everything goes right. Blegh. Such a boring story device.	0
I am moving out of my house in a month and would like to leave some easter eggs hidden for the new owners to find over the course of the next few years. Funny, scary, random. Anything goes. Ideas?	Install a switch into the fuse box that is not connected to anything and label it something weird like "Safe Room" or "Bunker".	Buy some fake body parts from Party City or something like that and hide them all over the house. Buy some extremely ugly colors of paint and do a horrible job repainting some rooms. Buy fake dog crap and leave it all over the house.	1
New Yorkers of Reddit, how realistic is the NYC in Spider-Man for PS4?	It's a bit compressed, and it's missing a pretty significant part of the northern end of the island, but it's about as accurate as you could reasonably expect. Definitely the most accurate Manhattan map I've seen.	It's not NYC, it's Manhattan. It's not even where Spider-Man is from, which is Queens. And that's bogus, in my opinion. The whole NYC = Manhattan thing gets pretty tiring.	1
What TV series isn't worth finishing?	That 70s show. Generally people say that Randy was the reason for the shitty ending, but IMO the show shouldn't have tried to change the original concept, or at least not drag it out. Season 7 ending could have worked fine for a series finale.	I could never get through Breaking Bad. ive tried a few times and just cant. I cant get last season 4 it just gets so slow and boring	1
People who have participated in “Real people, not actors” commercials, what actually happened behind the scenes?	Those commercials are so insulting to actors. They are implying that actors are not real people. You are a real person no matter what job you have.	I was in a Chinese buffet restaurant commercial as our u14 soccer team just won a trophy and one of the parents booked us as the "on screen talent". Idea being we'd all celebrate at this restaurant the big win in the ad and we'd all enjoy it and go there. We all did it for the free meal. Later they got shut down after multiple cases of food poison	0
Have you ever had a meal "on the house"? What was the reason?	IHOP. I had their spinach and egg wrap. It was bland as fuck. Ate it all cuz I ain’t no bitch. Waitress was like wow you really liked that. Tears in my eyes, booger bubbles I looked her deep in her soul. And told her it was ok, not great. She popped my nose bubble, wiped my tears and told me it was on the house. I gave her the tip in form of the meals cost and 20$ extra for being super cool.	I had ordered something from them, but when the time came to pay, I was a few cents short. The lady cashier/owner told me it was fine and waived it, but I promised I'd bring the complete total the next time I dropped by. A few days later I dropped in after work and met the husband of the cashier/co-owner of the store. When I handed him the change (20 cents) and told him why (he was very confused before explaining) he lit up and was like 'wow! :D' and I honestly can't remember what happened next and was bright red but he eventually coerced me into taking a free gelato on the house. Not exactly a meal, but close enough. They know me by name and face now and get happy when I come in. EDIT: Thanks for the silver kind stranger :D	0
What's the weirdest Craigslist transaction you've ever taken part in?	I brain my friend along to help me purchase a bed almost five years ago. The old geezer we were buying it from brings us downstairs to where the bed was and his DEAD WIFE is laying on top of it. HIS DEAD WIFE IS LAYNIG ON TOP OF THE BED THAT WE WERE INTENDING TO BUY. My friend is dead silent and I don't know what to do at this point. Obviously i don't want to buy it anymore, but I just don't know what do do when there's a dead person laying on my potential future bed. He tells us that he needs our help to put her in the trunk of his car (????)	A guy sold me a computer desk and when I was loading it a snake came out. He was trying to reverse shanghai this fucking snake into being *my responsibility!!* The Florida Keys are weird man.	0
What was the creepiest or most paranormal thing that’s ever happened to you?	my boyfriend and i woke up in separate parts of the house in hysterics, naked and covered in sweat. when we both finally calmed down and talked we realized we had the same dream of being surrounded by a group of black and white people with no mouths.	The honest, simple answer for all of you is that nothing paranormal ever happened to any of you. There might have been times where you didnt understand what happened, or how, or why to you or so on, but every time, there MUST have been a logical, cause-effect reason. These questions are not as useful as they appear imo.	1
What illegal thing did you do that you somehow got away with?	Was having sex in a parking lot as a young teen with nowhere else to go when I cop pulled up behind us. I guess someone in the houses somewhat near the empty lot called it in cause they saw our windows fogging. We ended up telling him we were on our way to an important meeting and were steaming our clothing in the back seat (we happened to have a used steamer we just bought with us), explaining why we were naked with the windows fogged. He left us alone, I couldn't believe it actually worked	I hacked the computer of another user of my local district net and deleted all the porn (very big collection) I occasionaly found there. I was just trying an exploit for XP SP1 and managed to get access to some computers, where I found passwords in the *.txt files on desktops, but never used this info to harm anyone or even for jokes. Only in the case of porn my evil radfem nature made me delete it:)	1
Theists of reddit, what are some of the questions you have for atheists?	Not a question, but i just wanted to let you guys no matter what you believe, i still love you all and so does God :)	a lot of religious people get frustrated or angry because of bigoted or ignorant people in their own faith who give a bad reputation to everyone else. do atheists have similar reactions to the stereotypical kind of "reddit atheist"?	0
What is the most random thing a stranger has said to you?	"How about them Muslims?" It was in an empty parking lot early in the morning as I was on my way into work. He was talking about a recent attack that happened in the UK I believe, and starts spouting off some racist nonsense... Yeah, I gtfo there as quick as I could	I was waiting for a bus when a homeless man pushing a shopping cart walked by. He said "Alright! How about a race around the block? Ready, set, go!" then he walked away. He didn't come back, so I'm pretty sure we tied.	0
[Serious] Civilians of Russia, what is your opinion on Putin's military actions in the last six months?	This thread runs a danger of having a North American- and Western Europe-based audience that upvotes Russians with North American/Western European views, which biases our view of what Russians think of Putin.	Save your time and just go to /r/russia and search for anything mentioning Crimea or the Ukraine. Spoiler: There is a reason Putin keeps getting reelected.	1
What video game was ahead of its time?	Battlefield 1942 To this day no battlefield title ever reached that scale again. I miss Carriers, Submarines and all that stuff.	undertale... i will get buried or thrown at with downvotes but imo we have alot of experiencing to do with games before we get to make decisions like that.	1
Police Officers of Reddit, what was the scariest thing you've encountered?	I'm a 911 Dispatcher. I've been getting a lot of juvenile suicide threats and sometimes even acts. I'm talking like 11-14year olds. Its very sad	Now this is a story all about how OPs post got flipped upside down so let me take a minute just sit right there I'm gonna tell you the importance of putting a [serious] tag.	1
What annoying medical problem do you have that is too insignificant to go see a doctor for, but really gets on your nerves?	I can't yawn. I'll get the urge, inhale nice and deep, and nothing happens - that beautiful, muscle shaking release never happens, and it always feels like "I can't get the yawn out". I used to be able to yawn, when I was a kid. I've gotten used to it but it's so stressful. I bet you're yawning right now, you bastard.. Edit: Holy shit, thanks for the Gold! And thanks to the people who have been offering some possible solutions - I didn't even know there were other poor souls like me.. I've been laughing all day reading everyone's battle against yawning while reading my comment, but just so you all know, I haven't been able to yawn, despite all of the wonderful triggers..however, my eyes sure are watering. Lol, there is no relief!	I should point out that while this thread is perfectly fine, people offering medical advice is not. The thread can stay up, but if you see people offering medical advice please report the comments. If too many happen, the thread may have to be removed. EDIT: just to be clear, medical advice constitutes you telling people what it could be, and also could *not* be. So if someone says "I get crushing headaches that last for a split second then vanish" and you reply with "that sounds like cluster headaches" *or* "everyone gets those, you're perfectly fine" then it's not allowed.	1
What rule as a child did you protest at the time but now agree with as an adult?	Its more like the other way around for me, plenty of shit i did not agree with back then but often figured the adults had solid reasoning behind their actions, realized later that is a illusion and much of what we endure as children is authoritarian bullshit by petty narrow-minded people who call themselves teachers but are hardly capable of teaching their narrow curriculum, let alone be a teacher or mentor off a wider scope and making a effect to really prepare you for this world.	Winner puts the game away. I was one of three boys, and we would be really irritating about bragging when one of us won a game (board game or otherwise). My parents wisely instituted this rule to teach us a little humility.	0
What simple fact, if everybody knew it, would cause mass panic?	That hell existed. edit - no, I'm not saying that hell actually exists, I assumed we were talking hypotheticals. Good grief.	There are microscopic mites that live on your eyelashes, and bury themselves under the follicles. They don't like light and so they wait until night and come out onto your eyelashes to reproduce. Millions of people have them and don't even know.	0
I'm sorry I was a bitch in high school. What have you done in your past that you need to apologize (even anonymously) for?	Nan, I'm so sorry I never visited once you got sick. I'm sorry I couldn't look you in the eye once you started losing your mind. I was scared. it doesn't mean I didn't love you. I love you so much.	wow.... apologizing anonymously on the internet, I can see the intent, but I'm sure a lot of those people would appreciate a real apology. And the guy that bought you lunch for a year, yeah you should go find him and blow him as a thank you for all the free lunches its people like you that I stayed far far away from in school, and I know that people can change, but most of the people that I knew like that in highschool are still fucking assholes.	1
A Polish expression translates as "Not my circus, not my monkeys." It means "Not my problem." Redditors, what other great expressions do you know in another language?	In Texan, "Yeehaw, saddle up partner!" means "I am most surely having a swell time, dost thou wisheth to join me in these escapades?"	One I heard in Finland that is said specifically to children who are being stubborn, 'EITHER YOU'LL DO IT, OR YOU'LL CRY AND DO IT!'.	0
What do you wanna talk about?	Girlfriend broke up with me a couple of days ago. All my friends are away at college. After she sent me that last text, I realized I had no friends left. I haven't really been able to talk to anyone about it.	Well the fact that I've been super depressed and kinda suicidal is probably important. And the fact that literally no one cares about me, so... it's one of those things that I really don't want to talk about but I know I need to. Fuck...	1
Have you ever walked out of a movie? What movie? Why'd you leave?	When I was 12, I walked out of The Ring when they showed that girl's face in the closet or whatever. Since I was crying like a bitch, the theater manager let me and my friends see Rush Hour 2 :/	Dark Knight Rises. Because God-Dammit, that movie was a pile of trash. I even went to the midnight showing. Walked out during the football stadium scene, my roommate followed me out and convinced me to come back in because we spent money on it. Walked out again when Batman was flying the bomb out of Gotham, yelled that I'd seen this in an episode of 24, and didn't come back in. I'm so glad I left when I did, evidently the movie became even more garbage as soon as that scene ended.	1
What happened that prompted you to distance yourself from a friend?	She was convinced she was better than me in every way because she was European and upper middle class, while I'm American and lower middle class. She treated me like her little feral child she was trying to civilize and would often show me off to her other rich friends and family to laugh about my poor person ways. We're doing better now, but that's because we don't really talk anymore. The distance is much better for our friendship.	I realized she and her (and mine at the time) friend were SJW tumblrina radical feminists who thought that only white people could be racist and that men should have to take classes in high school to teach them not to rape womyn.	1
Why is the entire internet not in an uproar over two people being prosecuted in the UK for using offensive language on social networking?	Well, it is the UK... between the fact they ban books, have overly used libel laws, allow the Merdouche press to flourish, persecuted Alan Touring, archive all email/phone traffic, believe that observing Shira law is acceptable context for community tribunals, have more security cameras per capita than anywhere else on the planet, paint over Banksey works and generally consist of an overly polite population of people whose empire has collapsed into nothingness, I'd say that it's about par for the course.	Perhaps they are gradually wising up to the fact that their emotions are blatantly exploited and their rage directed at some charismatic individual's cause du jour for about two weeks before they mount some sort of ineffective protest using tired or ineffective tactics without ever asking themselves if this is a genuine manifestation of their principles AND the best application of their time? Hah, I kid! It's probably because no one has made a clever video about it and people hate reading anything longer than a paragraph.	0
What are some not so well known services from companies that are known well that you take advantage of?	Always ask for fresh nuggets and fresh fries at McDonalds. It will take about 5 minutes or so, and everyone in line and behind the counter will hate you for it, but it's sooooo worth it. Also, if you are short on cash one month, you can usually call your cable or satellite company and tell them you are having financial difficulties, and are considering canceling you account. Depending on how long you've been a customer, you will sometimes get a few months or so of discounted service.	My dad pays $5 for satellite radio per month. He doesn't drive often, so called to cancel. They asked how much he would like to pay and he randomly said "$5" and the woman said, "Okay!".	0
People who've had crazy sexual tension with someone else and finally broke it, what's your story and do you regret it?	Had a friend in college, that therebwas some crazy tension between us. She had a boyfriend though, but that did not stop the flirting and all that. After college, I was at an anime convention and was texting her, and she ends up talking about where she would like chocolate licked off her body. Then asked me to come visit her at the different college she moved to. We banged like Jack rabbits in heat all weekend since there was no way he was going to find out. We both decided we just felt too right together to be FWB's. She split with her guy, and told him everything. We're getting married next year.	Had a customer come in for years and we exchanged numbers. There was always tension and looks between us. Other customers even noticed. I personally wish I would’ve been more confident and explored that option sooner because it turns out romantically we weren’t the most compatible. We had very different communication styles and in some ways were on different paths as far as life goals and aspirations. I initiated our first actual date that wasn’t a hangout or party and it went well enough for us to continue dating for a few months. Ultimately it fizzled out but I’m glad we tried it!	0
I have just found an old book...it is one of only four that exist in the whole world...am I rich?	A little unrelated to the book, but you need to speak to an attorney regarding your parent's debts. Unless you inherited something that is being used to secure a loan, such as the house you mentioned, you are not liable for your parents' debts. A collection agency will not tell you that, of course.	Bring it to Pawn Stars: Well, with the economy the way it is, there just isn't a market for an item like this. I'll give a call to my buddy who is an expert in late 19th century german-american youth books. I'll offer you $50 just because I think it is a cool item.	1
What's a weird recurring theme in your dreams?	I have those dreams where my teeth fall out too. Do they freak anybody else out? I know when I wake up I keep running my tongue over my teeth for a while, feeling a profound sense of relief that they're all still there.	I've had the same reoccurring dream since I was about 10 years old. It comes around every month or two and I'm still 10 years old in the dream. It's late at night and I'm lost in a big maze-like warehouse. There's a ninja in the warehouse hunting me. He throws a ninja star at me, cuts off my pinky finger, and I die. ...yep. And now I'm 24.	1
(NSFW) Women with long fake nails, how do you wipe that ass?	Serious answer, as someone who has had to wear long fake nails for a costume: You use way more toilet paper, fold it over your nails, and go for it. &#x200B; You're welcome?	As a cashier, i literally avoid as much hand contact w customers who have talons for nails. In my country it is normal for old men to have a looong uncut pinkie nail for obvious reasons (picking ears nose etc. I googled it out of curiosity during work and its like a status thing where it symbolises that you dont need to do hard labor + wealthy. Dumb Chinese trends..). Its so fucking disgusting.	1
Reddit, I'm toying with the idea of joining a dating site. Is it acceptable yet? What's your best stories from using dating sites?	It's acceptable. I met my SO online. I'm not really the type to go to bars or clubs, and I don't really interact with people while I'm out in public all that much, so, it worked for me.	No man-up and go talk to people. Join a club/activity group that you like and meet people with similar interest as you. And if you are only looking for one night stands go to a club.	1
What's the most unprofessional thing a boss has said to you?	I heard a rumor about you. Are you a single dad? Because single parents and me don't get along. In the past we never have. But maybe you'll be different. Probably not. I assume you're not dependently wealthy. You need this job. Maybe consider getting rid of your kid. You know, if you're not wealthy.	When I was about 23 or so, I was on a business trip and hanging out in the hotel bar with all my fellow coworkers that were at the conference. One of the Vice Presidents was there, drunk, and told me I was a "very sexy woman" and that he would like to "make love to" me. At the time, I was so shocked I didn't really say or do anything about it. Now I'm 30 and I'm like, damn, I wish he would say something like that to me again. Because I'm old enough and confident enough to handle it properly (you know, like, by REPORTING THE FUCK OUT OF IT). But of course he won't, because ... I'm old enough and confident enough to handle it properly. (not because I'm not sexy dammit I still got it)	1
What money mistakes do you see others making?	My dad will use any ATM he comes across. It wouldn't be that big of a deal if he just got the ATM fee, but his bank charges him 2.50 every time he uses someone else's ATM. So he gets charged anywhere from 4.50-6.50 each time does this, and usually it's 2-4 times a week.	I see couples with low-paying, unstable jobs have children, and want to strangle them. The parents, that is. To raise a child and still have some savings for retirement requires way more than it ever did. You're a drain on society if you have just enough to get by but still decide to reproduce. "Well what if it was an accident?" *THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS WITH ALL THE PROTECTION AVAILABLE TO YOU TODAY*.	1
Redditors, what is your top life Goal?	It's funny how your goals get slightly more sober as you get older. I want nothing more than to have only just enough money that I never have to worry about the future - I just want to be FREE. I want to have a huge library, pantry and wine cellar, and a huge collection of vinyl. I've worked my arse off enough of my adult life, that simply being able to read books in the sunshine any day of the week will just about do me. Oh, and I want to have just enough land that I can have bonfires, shoot beer cans or blow things up without having to worry about local bureaucrats being a pain in the arse. Too much to ask for?	To retire somewhere where land and building materials are cheap, then build a big-ass manor which will have all sorts of trap-doors, secret rooms, and a super secret slide system so my lazy ass doesn't have to walk from one side to the other!	1
[Serious] Men who have been sexually assaulted by women, what is your story?	35 years ago, when I was in High School and all of 17, my science teacher let me know she wanted me. Like multiple times. She saw me at the mall (it was the 80's, so mall-duh), & came onto me *hard* we wound up in her car in the parking lot (no cameras back then, thank goodness) and she gave me a hand job. I wound up banging her like 10+ times over the next 6 months while she was in a divorce. No one ever found out. I was a willing participant, after only minor convincing, but trust me, she was on me like a Democratic Senator on an intern. Really. Now I have a hard time with people keeping secrets from me, and i trust no one, except my wife, and that took more than a dozen years of marriage before we got there	It was my 21st birthday party. I was drunk off my ass. One of my friends friends that I didn't care for drove me home. I thought they were coming to pick her up. I didn't know at the time that she told them not to bother. I pretty much crashed and went to sleep. I woke up to her on top of me. I was still to drunk and out of it to get her off of me. She told my friends later that she hoped she was pregnant as she really wanted a baby. Thankfully, she wasn't.	0
What unwritten rules do you follow that some people seem to have no concept of?	Speak your mind. Don't sugarcoat shit. I'm known among my friends as an asshole for it but at least I don't confuse anyone about what I really feel.	If I am going to be late or not show up for something, I call/text to let the person know. Even if it's someone I don't know. I was selling my vehicle recently and I had several people call to say they were coming over to look at it and they would just not show up. I was waiting and waiting...	0
What have you witnessed someone do that made you realize he/she is really, really smart?	One time my drunk uncle was in jail and needed bail money, and being that my dad was the only one in the family with any real savings, they all looked to him to fork up 100% the cash. Having been asked, he realized this situation had two possible outcomes: 1. Pay for his bail and never get the money back 2. Not pay for the bail and the whole family blame him for it. So, my dad decided to throw them a curve ball. He told them that whatever the rest of the family raised for the bail, he'll not only match it, he'll offer DOUBLE whatever they raised together. Nobody offered 1 cent. Blame averted. EDIT: I'm quite amused by the shared laughter from everyone, I'm going to tell my dad about this later. He'll think it's hilarious too.	At Thanksgiving one year someone asked my Father about the blueberries he used in the blueberry pie. He explained it thusly: "It's an equal distribution of labor. Lorraine picks the blueberries, and I make the sun come up each morning so they'll grow". At that moment I realized my Father was on another level entirely.	1
Parents of kids that did not succeed as adults (jail, drugs, etc): how do you feel about a decision and experience of being a parent?	In retrospect, I can see where I could have done things differently in some instances of my parenting decisions and it might have influenced circumstances for the better. That being said, I can also honestly say that even with things as they are, I enjoy being a parent. My children are in their mid to late 20s and their behavioral patterns are pretty well set, but I still have hope that they will find their way to happier, more fulfilling lives. I never loved anyone with my entire being before I had my first child and I hope that I have conveyed that capacity to them.	I had a boy once. I did my best to try to raise him up and teach him some good skills like cooking and car repair that would really benefit him in the future. Then one day about a year ago he just vanished and never heard from or saw him again. I still wonder what went wrong and drove him away... maybe it was the jumper cables.	1
Guys, what the most uncomfortable situation a “Nice Girl” has put you in?	I was volunteering at an event to fight homelessness and I struck up a conversation with a girl while there. The conversation was tame and there was no flirting. I’m married and was wearing my ring. We talked and got along great even making some jokes here and there, but again, no flirting. To her credit, I don’t think I ever mentioned my wife or that I was married as the subject never came up, again, no flirting. Anyway, later that night after the event I log into FB and to find a 3 paragraph PM from the girl about how she felt betrayed and couldn’t believe I was married. Edit: I realize I didn’t mention the she too was a volunteer and not homeless.	ITT: guys desperate to find a "nice girl" counterpart to "nice guy" that they basically describe any girl that's crazy without any other common thread.	1
What do you use daily that wasn’t designed for what you use it for?	Those sponge mops with the roller thing that squeezes the excess water out? Those are great for catching wasps that get into your home. Pin the bastard against the wall with the sponge, roll him up, stick the end of the mop out the door, and release him back into the wild. Hopefully he finds it embarrassing as well.	Growing up we had a knife in our house that we used in the bathroom instead of the kitchen. That's all I can comfortably say.	1
What are some of your worst/funniest gym experiences?	I was working out and saw this hot ass MILF. I was looking just enough to let her know that if she is down to get railed by a random dude while her husband watches, I'm that random dude.	took a sip from the water fountain and as I stood up one tiny drop of water went down my windpipe. I knew I was going to cough and I tried to contain it. What happend was a very strong burst of mist came out of my pursed lips, right into the face of the girl waiting in line for the fountain. I went as red as a tomato and she kind of laughed and asked if I was ok. I managed to get a "I think so" out as she politely dabbed her face with her towel. SO. embarrassing. :(	0
Which country do you know absolutely nothing about ?	Being a citizen of the US: All of them. The level of geography / history of other countries taught during school here in the US is vastly different than that of other countries. The US really only focuses on ourselves like a narassistic child...	Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia. I just don't know. Edit: I just got back to see the replies. You guys are awesome. Thanks for enlightening me and everyone else here!	0
How come science fairs always say "no parental help" and then reward the kids who obviously had help from their parents?	My senior year in high school I cultured functional synapses in-vitro using smooth muscle tissue and neurons (which were dedifferentiated to neuroblasts, cultured, and allowed to mature into functioning neurons). I photographed synapses in culture with a scanning electron microscope and measured the force generated when the muscle tissue contracted. I had no help. I did have many adults pull strings to get access to the equipment, etc. Also I worked on this project non-stop for 2 years. We are not all cheaters ;)	The trick to winning seems to be cheat like hell, but make sure your child can actually explain the basic workings of the experiment to the judges, school seem entirely unwilling to call bullshit on the obvious daddy did it for me projects. I've also lost a science fair to a kid who had some very serious help when I'd had none.	0
Teachers of Reddit (or others who work with children): Have you ever suspected a kid in your class to be a sociopath? How did he/she turn out as an adult?	I work at a summer camp. One year a kid (he was 12 I think) killed a caterpillar and made his fellow campers really upset. I took this kid aside to get him calmed down and explain why what he did was wrong, he said to me "I like killing things. What's wrong with that?"	Many of them are some of my closest friends now, monkey_rapist, cat_rapist, dog_rapist, Ieathorsecock, and jaguar_fucker all had been suspected sociopaths. We never understood why our parents wouldn't take us near animals...	1
What’s something you irrationally believed as a kid?	I thought a grocery store cashier was the best job in the world because of all the money they got paid by the customers.	That there was an all-knowing man in the sky who controlled everything (both good and bad) and who already had everyone’s life planned out. I believed I had to worship and pray to him daily, and confess my kid “sins” weekly or else he would send me to the “bad place” to be tortured for all of eternity.	1
What will you always judge people for doing?	Being picky eaters. Can't stand it. There's no reason a functional adult should say shit like "don't make anything with broccoli or mushrooms". No, how about you grow the fuck up?	Idiots who don't let the people getting OFF public transportation (buses, subway, etc) first. Chill out, the door will be open long enough to let you get in afterwards.	0
What is something that the majority of people do incorrectly?	Apply make-up The personal ads have devolved into a veritable clown show. You're not the Dubai Tower, ladies. Let's cut back on that foundation just a tad.	Everyone's doing everything wrong according to those "you're doing it wrong" pics and videos that got popular a few years ago. Eating an apple? Wrong! Getting a Tic Tac? Wrong! Breathing? Wrong!	0
Now that you have spent a night in your guest room, what is wrong with it?	I thought it would be a great idea to dog sit and the dogs peed all over my guest room. Months later, I'm still trying to get the damn smell out.	It has no insulation so temperature is either way too hot or freezing Its located near a road so can be noisy when neighbors leave in the morning We use it as a storeroom and its collected a good amount of junk over the past few years In all i think its perfect to ensure guests dont stay too long	0
Ok Reddit, What are some Clever questions asked by cops to get you in trouble?	I was once pulled over for not wearing a seat belt even though I clearly was. He then asked, "Are you calling me a liar?". Cool. I say "yes" and I don't know what kind of trouble I am in. I say "no" and I get a ticket even though I am wearing a seat belt. I just replied with "I am wearing a seat belt." and of course he wasn't happy about that either. I just don't like his initial question to which there is no correct answer.	Rule One: NEVER talk to cops without a lawyer present. Rule Two: FUCKING NEVER EVER EVER talk to fucking pigs without a lawyer present!	1
What is a "fact" often posted on Reddit which is just not true, or not as certain as posters claim it to be?	The whole gender wage gap pops up every so often. Turns out women either don't work as much or just choose lower paying professions on average.	In any askreddit thread with the word "history" in the title, the top 10 posts at least are likely to be at least partially untrue. I don't even bother reading them anymore.	0
What has been the worst fashion fad in human history?	Bustles and corsets were fucking dumb. Shit just made women look weird and distorted. I also think men's ties are pretty uselessly idiotic as well. I don't remember ever being impressed at a piece of silk hanging from my neck.	Back in the 17th century, women would take small amounts of arsenic to give their skin a desirable pale complexion.	0
Using only popular references, what is your favorite show/movie?	Just give me all the bacon and eggs you have. Wait, wait. I'm worried what you just heard was, "Give me a lot of bacon and eggs." What I said was, "Give me all the bacon and eggs you have". Do you understand?	Favorite shows: "Bazinga!" "It needs to be about 20% cooler." "This whole evening is roo-eeened!" "What's up, Doc?" Favorite movies: "Leave the gun. Take the cannolli." "Meg's gravy is famous; it's practically a food group." "They're here!" "Answer me, Sen!"	1
What was the saddest realization that you have ever had about yourself or your life?	That I can't be a part of my family and queer at the same time. If I choose my family, i'll never truly be happy because I'll be hiding a part of myself from them. If I choose my queerness, my family is very likely to shun and disown me.	One of the saddest realizations I have ever had about life happened when I was 5. I remember standing in the hallway of my grandmas house on new years eve, and my grandma took the 1990 calendar down from the wall and put up a 1991 calendar. It was then that I realized, I'm never going to see 1990 again. That it's gone now and I can't go back. And it was then that it started to dawn on me that I will actually get old. It was heavy stuff for a little kid, and I still remember that day so clearly.	0
Car salesmen of reddit, what's the most outrageous thing anyone has done while out on a test drive?	One time I left my dad's 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder at a parking garage in downtown Chicago. The odometer was off the charts. It turns out, the parking attendants took it out for a joyride. We tried putting the car in reverse to decrease the odometer; it didn't work.	Friend's story: a customer took a Mazda sedan for a test drive and midway pulled over and asked to swap with the salesman to experience the car from the passenger seat. Just as they were about to drive off again he says he feels sick and can't go on, and thanks for his time. Turns out he just wanted a lift into town.	0
What are signs that someone is secretly unhappy?	Orange skin. Obsession with crowd sizes, hand sizes, vote sizes, anything to do with size, really. Weird defensive tweets sent at all hours. Refusal to accept facts.	Nonchalance about their own personal health or safety. If you see someone start drinking more or smoking out of the blue, it might be an escape from psychological pain. If they aren't showering as much, ignoring people, staying in bed a lot, eating less. These are all signs that they don't have the energy or aren't happy. Many symptoms you'd see on someone with the flu are things you'd see on someone whose depressed.	0
What's the worst piece of advice your parents ever gave you?	Watched my single mother struggle to pay bills and keep roof over our heads which lead to me being cheap and frugal with money all my life.... mom died when i was 16 and her last words to me on her deathbed were "to not be so cheap and frugal with insurance money from her death. And to enjoy it and spend it if it made me happy". Blew all insurance money on stupide shit and drugs trying to fill the void she left in my life. By the time i was 19 i was penniless and homeless cause i had tried to enjoy the money rather than be frugal with it.	"just put it in the brown eye, you don't get shit on your dick," -My dad. On my 18th bday pub crawl...	0
*Not Trolling* Can someone walk me through the argument that piracy is morally defensible?	Let me ask you this: I can buy any popular CD online on Amazon, used, at 1/10th the price that it was new. The record company doesn't get any of that money. Is that theft? Why/why not? Would it be theft if I paid full price, but the record company still didn't get any money? Is the seller stealing by reselling the CD?	I hate all the fucking people who resort to word semantics to feel justified. "Oh, it's not the same as stealing from a store..." Shut the fuck up. There are people making products and you are taking said product without paying for it. That's stealing. I admit that I pirate, and I do so because I'm a cheap shit, but lately I've been trying to pay for more and more things. I recognize the immorality of my actions and I own up to them. I don't hide behind "technical definitions" to save face and the sense of entitlement from the opposing cheap shits make me want to punch their mothers and make them eat compact discs	1
You get one wish, you can wish for anything at all, it can defy all laws of nature etc. What do you wish for?	MORE WISHES. If I can't do that, full control over time. I can make myself old or young again, reverse and top time in pockets, bubbles. Freeze some people unfreeze others. I would just live like gary's mod for awhile.	Ageless immortality with the caveat of intentional suicide. Given enough time you can master everything else. Eventually you will get extremely lonely, and that's when the caveat comes in handy.	0
What impossible situation do you often fantasize about?	Being able to send my consciousness back to myself in the past, with everything I know now. I'd do so many things differently, avoiding the mistakes, having the experiences I never had, etc.	Donald Trump admitting to his crimes and corrupt actions, his thievery and allll the lies. Finally coming clean and resigning in disgrace. It'll never happen. It won't happen because he has no shame. He has no morals or values other than mineminemine, moremoremore. He is the worst thing to happen to my country in all my life. He is evil. I fantasize that one day, the American people will stand up for what is right and good and demand he resign. We are better than this. Or, at least, I thought we were. Fucking MAGAts.	1
To Reddit Parents: as a first time mom, what baby stuff do I really need and what is a waste of money?	DO NOT BUY A BABY WALKER. THEY ARE DEATH TRAPS. A quick google search will confirm what I am telling you ( the American Academy of Pediatrics has been trying to get them banned for years)	Oddly, clothes for when the kidling is about a year old. We got about a metric tonne of baby clothes from friends and relatives. Didn't have to buy anythng. Until he turned one, and suddenly we had not a single thing that fit him. Stroller, yes. Baby car seat, yes. Bonus: car seat acts as baby handbag, making baby easy to transport, and creating instant baby chair wherever you go. More nappies/diapers. No, more than that. No, more even than that. More sleep. But you won't get that :( Take more pictures than you think you'll need.	0
What is the smartest thing you have done while you were drunk?	Cops broke up a party at the small university i was attending. They arrested everyone underage. People ran into bedrooms and shut the lights and closed doors. I ran into a room with a girl, told her to leave the door open and lights on. We went into the closet. Cops arrested everyone in the other rooms. Poked their heads into our room and left.	Tried to wake up another random drink guy I found passed out on the street. He woke up for 10 seconds got really aggressive and then went back to sleep. I was mad and stole the money out of his wallet. I made 40 bucks that night for attempting to do a good deed.	1
Starting this year, Belgium has mandatory classes where you learn things you need to know when functioning in a society (things like taxes, savings, finding a job...). This is given at around the age of 12. What do you think about this, and should other countries do this too?	It's the same as sex ed, you have to teach kids and teens to avoid misconceptions that will only be learnt after having serious consequences (if ever). I really hope media literacy is included in these classes.	The reason they don’t do this is because they want to keep us poor. Who’s going to work the 9-5/6 jobs that are for the most part medial? If we taught people how to make money in school, people would be doing their own thing and not contributing as much to big corporations seeing as though they’d know how to make the money themselves. It’s sad, and disheartening but this is the unfortunate truth.	1
What is the weirdest thing that made you cry?	I watched a morbidly obese man belt out "Proud to be an American" completely off key at a Veteran's Day assembly when I was in 3rd grade. I thought it was the most beautiful performance ever.	Prom episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer when Oz showed up in his tux. I was really, really obsessed with Seth Green at the time and was overwhelmed by his hotness and the futility of my love.	1
Parent's of reddit who let their kids use electronics in restaurants at full volume, why?	Not as bad as the fully grown African American males who walk around with their phone blasting trash music instead of simply putting on headphones.	Currently sitting in the waiting room at the doctor's office. There is a girl watching Finding Dory at full volume. Her mother is watching it with her... There is also a grown man watching what sounds like the Cleveland Show at full volume... 😑	0
Women of Reddit, do you feel that a large percentage of the men that you've been around cannot deny sex when offered? And what would be your reaction to a man saying no to you?	I do not feel a very large percentage of the men I hang around with would be unable to deny sex if offered, no.	I had a girl tell me she'd have sex with if I chugged a can of coke she was holding, true story. I told her no because I did not want to have sex with her. Looking back, I did want that coke, though.	0
What questions will you never get sick of seeing on AskReddit?	"What's a story that you've never found the right AskReddit thread to tell?" Always just loads of obscure, unrelated stories.	Any thread that asks about your country. It gives Australians free reign to be even more Australian than they could ever imagine. It's like a hivemind where we take the piss out of the rest of the world.	1
If a state declares that life begins at conception, can I legally drink when I'm 20 years and 3 months old?	Yes under that system. Also the mean life expectancy goes way down and the infant mortality rate goes way up. Especially among teenage rich white girls.	"In today's news, a new law is passed requiring that someone be 21 years and 9 months old to purchase or consume alcohol because some people were getting all technical and shit."	0
I like to search for things like "recipe for human liver" on a library computer and then just leave with the result page open. What little mean pleasures do you enjoy to freak people out?	I always fake banging my head on signs, doors etc. just to get an "oh my god are you alright" from people.	I keep a few of those family stick figure decals in my glove box. If I see a car with these stickers showing 3 or more kids, I add an extra child from my glovebox. I've done this about 6-7 times now, but never recognized a car I've hit, or stayed around to catch the expression of anyone who stops to count their children.	0
What is your most socially unacceptable opinion?	An opinion against fact is not an opinion, it is bullshit. For example, if someone were to say the earth is flat. Edit: example	Eating dead animals is now nutritionally unnecessary (often damaging) and environmentally unsustainable, and it should therefore be legislated against in the same ways as sugar or tobacco.	1
I only recently read Reddit's Reddiquette only to realize that almost all of the content I have been seeing on the front page, directly correlates with one of the bullet points in the 'Please don't' section. How did this come to be?	Most subreddit moderators do no strictly moderate based on reddiquette. The users vote for which content they want on the front page. The users don't often consider reddiquette when voting.	Can't upset any redditors, they'll all start cutting onions or some other retarded bullshit! Also, the community would be a lot smaller (and probably more mature) if all the little whiny jackasses were banned for breaking it.	1
I had a conversation through my door with a burglar at 3AM, have you had a non-violent/threatening interaction with a criminal in the act?	Had a friend who after falling asleep in a football game stadium toilet caught a taxi home . It was only when she was sitting on the couch eating a slice of pizza that she realised she hadn't lived there in six months and had used her old key to get in the door. Quietly left.	I saw a guy fondling himself in the parking lot of a Steak N Shake once. We didn't really interact.	1
If life had achievements, what would they be?	Toxic Waste Removal - Realizing your roommate from College makes a terrible flatmate and kick his ass to the curb. Edit: Speling.	Part of the System - Get a job Ready and Able - Went through puberty Mini Me - Had a kid What Diet? - Eat 3x recommended daily intake Why isn't everybody naked? - Speak in front of 20+ people	0
Parents of Reddit: Be honest, has there ever been a moment that you regretted having children?	One time when I was changing my daughters diaper she projectile shat so ferociously that it not only ended up on my arms/hands, but on our bed several feet away. I definitely questioned my choice at that point. Otherwise it's been pretty damn awesome though. You get to see a person go from knowing absolutely nothing about the world to figuring it out. Pretty surreal.	Of course it is just biological. What isn't? Unless you have strong religious beliefs then you must see that everything we think, say and do is controlled by our biology. Doesn't mean that it will not give us great joy, love, delight, fulfillment, interest etc . Food, sex, scratching an itch, making friends, fighting wars, wearing clothes, loving our parents etc etc are all based on our biology . Having children gives us huge rewards because if it wasn't fantastic the human race would have stopped doing it and died out long ago. Remember most people do it more than once!!	1
If a woman rapes a man and gets pregnant, what happens next?	Theoretically speaking she would get charged for rape and go to prison, probably a nice one where she is by herself so the inmates don't hurt the baby. I don't think the man would have any legal obligation to ever see or hear from that woman or the child again.	in MOST states: the man will pay child support. however, the man can bring suit against the woman in tort and recover a judgment against the woman. if the woman has assets, it could end up a wash (judgment payments canceling out child support payments). however, if the woman does not, or if the woman has the judgment debt wiped out through bankruptcy.... then the man is involuntarily fucked a second time. source: i am a lawyer.	0
What are your "be careful what you wish for" stories?	Once I wished I had never been born but then the Spirit of Christmas came and showed me what my friends' and relatives' lives would be like without me so I changed my mind and learned my lesson.	Years ago, a week or so before Valentine's Day, my wife mentioned to me how she wished we could spend all Valentine's Day in bed. We got to spend all Valentine's Day in bed. We both ended up with room-spinning, projectile-vomiting flu. We had it so bad, my in-laws had to watch our children for us. About halfway through the day, I turned to her and said, "well, you got to spend today in bed. How do you like it so far?" She just laughed and replied, "not what I had in mind."	0
Maids, au pairs, gardeners, babysitters, and other domestic workers to the wealthy, what's the weirdest thing you've seen rich people do behind closed doors?	Helped my mother in law who was a maid once with a very large mansion in NC. Beautiful house, amazing architecture. They traveled the world all the time. The kitchen had old old appliances from the 70's, the wife's bathroom had a broken toilet seat that was duct taped together. The wife did not rewear her underwear. We were not to go in the basement. I peaked down there, there were clothes three foot deep in the basement where she took off her clothes and just threw them down there. Thousands of pairs of underwear. Very weird people.	I am the assistant of a very wealthy guy. He's pretty awesome and drives amazing cars. However he oftenly beats people up or loses his temper, but that makes him the guy he is. It's sometimes as if he lives a double-life. I already care for him since his youth, as he lost both his parents after some boring play.	1
What's the naughtiest thing you ever did as a child?	Not even fronting, I fingered a girl in kindergarten. My mind was too young the fathom the concept of being horny, but for some reason doing it was awesome anyway.	In 2nd grade, this girl was being mean to me, so I pushed her flower pot (we all made one) out of a 3rd floor window. And when she finished remaking another one, I pushed that one out of a window, too.	0
Climate change deniers of reddit, what is your reason(s) for denying it?	Anyone who denies climate change is a moron. Plain and simple. Sorry to be so blunt, but I think I'll go with what 99.9% of the scientific community says on the subject rather than listen to some politician who has financial interests in believing otherwise. People are so dumb it's insanity. The Republican Party is the only major political party on earth that denies climate change. I hope these kids suing the government right now continue to do so and win. It's their future they're looking out for, not these old politicians who are going to die in the next 20 years anyways. Mike Pence tried to convince people that smoking doesn't kill you or cause cancer...in the year 2000!!! This is now someone who is in charge of our country. Way to go everyone who voted them in to office! Idiocracy is real.	This thread is full of people downvoting climate change deniers and upvoting dumb jokes, therefore negating the point of this thread which is to see why people deny climate change. Don't punish people for giving their opinion when asked. For those who want an actual answer, sort this thread's comments by Controversial, because that's where the real climate change deniers will be.	0
People living in democratic countries, how do you reconcile with the Claude McDonald quote — 'Sometimes a majority simply means that all the fools are on the same side.' ?	That is the reason Thomas Jefferson, in his first inaugural address, said, "All, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail, that will to be rightful must be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which equal law must protect, and to violate would be oppression." The Constitution provides protections for the people specifically for this reason.	Thats why a true Democracy is always destined to fail. That's also why a Constitutional Republic is a much better thing. Unfortunately, our Republic is slowly being turned into a Democracy.	1
What is the most flat out stupid way your company wasted your time and its money?	Sent every engineer 7000 miles away to the mother company for weeks at a time to learn how they do it. Like they were expecting a bunch of American born, bred, and trained engineers to do it the Korean way? Ha!	Had me rip out perfectly good carpet only to change their minds and want the office carpeted again. Edit: All within three hours.	0
My friend fakes proposal (to his wife) at restaurants and gets free food &amp; drinks often. What asshole moves are you not asshole enough to pull off but sometimes wish you were?	OP, I wouldn't call that an asshole move. He's getting free food and drink, sure. But man, is that guy keeping his marriage exciting.	when people complain in a restaurant about a perfectly good meal just to get it for free. the reason I hate this so much is because it's genuinely scummy and makes the server/chef/host feel like they've done a poor job even though more often than not, they haven't.	0
What is your preferred method of dealing with anxiety?	Interracial cuckolding. Hear me out. For white people, most neurosis are due to our inherent racism. By cuckolding, we can undo the anxiety caused by our racism. It's Freudian to the core and unless your a Trump supporter you should give it a try.	Running. Even if you don't work out regularly, just get out and jog. I quickly go from panicked to calm and once I'm done I'm able to think clearly without the anxiety. 10/10 would recommend.	0
What is the most pathetic thing you've ever seen?	I have a friend who was given a trip to Japan by his parents for graduation. It isn't until September, so he had plenty of time this summer to make some money for while he was there. Instead, he set up a Go-Fund-Me page and begged all our mutual friends for money. Whenever someone pointed out that he could get a job to get some money, he had ten thousand excuses as to why he couldn't get a job. We all pretty much ignore him, but he keeps posting it on Facebook with 'please help send me to Japan' posts every couple of days. It's been sitting at $25 bucks from his aunt for the last couple months. I would say it's pretty pathetic.	"All lives matter" This is equivalent to me walking into a child cancer ward. After listening to a child say "child cancer sucks :(" I retort "NO ALL CANCER SUCKS" While I am technically correct, I come off as an inconsiderate douche, who does not know how to empathize with the suffering of others.	1
I've only kicked a kickball three times in my life. Each time has been straight into an innocent bystander's face. Reddit, what's your curse?	Whenever I play air hockey, no matter who it's with or the location, the puck ALWAYS goes flying off the table, into someone. I once got myself and my friend kicked out of an arcade/kids play area because I smacked a 3 year old girl in the head with a plastic puck. feelsbadman.jpg	Blind dates: The first time I was set up on one, a dump truck ran a red light and sideswiped her car. (She ended up being fine, but her passenger was in the hospital for a week). A couple years later, I was set up on another blind date, and she rolled her car on the way to the date. (She was fine beyond the totaled car, never did end up going on a date with her though). A couple months later, I was set up on a third blind date, and a couple days before we were going to meet up, her brother got arrested for meth, and she received custody of her three-year-old niece she had barely seen.	0
Is there a person whom you met once in your life and and are likely to never meet again that you sometimes think of? Who is that person?	When I was like 12-13, I went to a week long summer camp. I was the really awkward, shy girl and I always struggled to make/keep friends. Well at this camp, I was being my usually awkward shy self and putting my sleeping bag and stuff on a top bunk in the cabin I was assigned and another girl walks in and takes the top bunk next to mine. We just instantly clicked. I have never before or since clicked so perfectly with someone before and we were absolutely inseparable for the rest of the camp. I had the time of my life. I never learned her last name and we completely lost touch after the camp was over. Shawna, I hope life is as kind to you as you were to me. Edit: There are apparently a million shawnas that attended summer camps in my time frame.	Yes, but don't want to put in the work to tell it well. Basically girl bartender invites people to have drinks after last call. Giving away shots, selling off sale etc. Doing lots of extra work, I ask her why, she says "because I know what its like to want a drink after last call" super cool, asks me to go have a smoke with her (I don't smoke, but say yes) While I wait for her guys offers me $100 for a 6 pack I bought. I accept, she thinks I took advantage of the guy, so we did not go for a smoke.	1
What is the absolute strangest thing you've ever seen a teacher do?	I had a history teacher. Very calm, collected individual. He was a great storyteller, but he had a reputation for "crazy". During the entire first year, I had no idea where this reputation had come from. He was a good teacher, always had interesting stuff to tell about the subject he was teaching. Then we got to WW2. Without warning, he launched into a *perfect* Adolf Hitler impression.	ugh, mine is so dumb my semester at university he forgets meeting with me all the time...i constantly bring up dates and hes got nothing. its really kind of sad, i really want to pass and im trying at it, but the guy lost any mind he ever had, we became friends, but he can't remember anything other than what the book can tell him.	1
Reddit, as a classical musician, tell me what we could do better. What is it about classical music that keeps you away from our concerts?	I personally just do not like the music. Do you like screamo? Chiptune? Ambient? If you said "no" to one of them, why? How could you change your mind? Another issue to me is that you are pretty much supposed to like it to be cultured. This is ALWAYS something which rubs me the wrong way. Whether it's Mozart (whose music makes me irrationally angry), Shakespeare, Picasso or the Beatles.	The biggest problem I have is that I occasionally hear a piece of classical music and think "Wow! That sounds amazing!" yet if nobody at the start or end of the piece tells me the name or the composer then I have no way of finding it again until i encounter it by chance. There are several pieces that I LOVE but I have no idea what they are called and could only hum them to someone. With modern music, one can generally google the lyrics to find the song and the band/song name will be heavily promoted along with the track. I have no real input as to how this can be solved, but it's something that I've thought for a while and it's a great shame.	0
Doctors of reddit: Have any of you actually had a delivery where a single race family has had a child of a different race? (indicating a cheating wife) Was it awkward?	What does happen pretty frequently is two dark skinned people are a little confused because their baby is born with very pale skin. It usually takes a couple of months for the baby to get his or her "full color". The guys have always asked about it very diplomatically :)	This reminds me of this chinese couple. They get pregnant and when the baby arrives, he's black. So they named him Sum Ting Wong. (say it outloud)	1
When did you realize your parents aren't the smartest people in the world?	The time my mom absent-mindedly tied her sweatpants strings to her steering wheel at a stop light and then had to lift her whole body out of her seat to take a turn	When my dad, sitting at the dinner table one night with the news on the telly in the background, said casually "It's such a terribly wicked religion, Islam." It was the first time that I ever gave in and just stood up to my father and told him he was wrong about something. I won't have that kind of bullshit spoken in my presence. Edit: Downvoting because we all believe that the central premise of Islam is "Be evil"? Really, Reddit?	1
What is something that you are slowly starting to realize about yourself?	I don't give a shit about you, so don't pretend to give a shit about me. This is how I've always gone through life. It works.	I don't have as many friends as I once thought I had. And that all in all, I'm pretty lonely.	0
What double standard, NOT related to gender or race, bothers you?	When I spend my day inside reading, I'm applauded and no one bothers me, even when it's a "easy ready, easy forgotten", Harlequin book. When I spend my day inside, on the laptop, I'm criticized, people want to me to go out, insist that it isn't good for me to not see the sun, even when I'm following an online course.	"Religious people are idiots." No, not all are. Just because something can't be proved doesn't mean it should be treated as if it's been *disproved*. Believing in something *not* proved is not the same as believing in something *disproved*. EDIT: If you downvote, please reply with a reason why. Otherwise I assume your reason can't be articulated besides "I don't like what you said"	1
What are two truths and one lie about you?	I read anime books for the plot, not to jerk off I love RPGs but detest Zelda and Skyrim and Borderlands I drive a 1995 Honda Accord	One time I had sex with a sandwich/ I've lost a total of 250lbs in 4 years/ I have a fear of giant squids, despite living in Kentucky	0
What have you found out about someone AFTER they died?	Nana had dentures. Not even her husband knew. Edit for clarification: She kept them clean, and kept them hidden in a box behind her sink u-bend when she slept. She passed in her sleep. Papa was very surprised. But now we know why she was obsessive about everyone's dental hygiene.	About a year ago, I was notified that my former mentor-turned enemy (now erased from existence) had left me with a video recording. He confessed to murdering my mother, allowing my father to finally be released from prison (he had been locked up in there since I was a kid). My father and I were reunited for about a day or so, before he decided to abandon me and my friends in order to travel the world or something. He came back a couple months later though, so I guess that was cool...until another one of my enemies killed him right in front of me. I wasn't fast enough to save my father's life, but at least I managed to defeat his killer in a race. Now, excuse me while I go stick my d*** in the timeline...again.	1
This month I lost custody of my kids in my divorce, half my income, I'm getting evicted, and was diagnosed with PTSD from the Marine Corps. Reddit, what do you do to keep your head up when it seems you've got nothing going for you anymore?	men need to unite and stop the destruction of men in the family unit. get together and destroy these bitches that would steal a mans children	Similar situation here. I'm a foster parent to a 2 year old been with us since she was 4 days old. We were planning to adopt her. Courts decided to reunite her with her parents which both just got out rehab with a new 7 month old. She went back to them on Monday. Make small plans for yourself. Tomorrow I'm going to gym, visit a friend. Getting up and grabbing breakfast. Etc... Small things. No single moment will last for ever. Those who endure conquer. Good luck brother.	0
Reddit, I just watched my ex in an amateur porn site. What situations have you come across in life that you never thought once would happen to you?	I just MUST comment on this that this probably never will happen to me. My ex has become a radical feminist. She is weird as fuuuck but lucky enough it wasn't my fault so she isn't stalking me. If she did porn, the video sure would be some weird-ass feminist porn... If this will come, I will NOT deliver for your own safety.	I had an ex-girlfriend who took a lot of my money mail me a check for more than a thousand dollars with an apology letter about eight years later.	0
Someone is messing with me and my girlfriend. We think they have access to our texts and vms. Can anyone give us some help?	Create a website that tracks the IP of people that visit it. Send the url to your girlfriend under some pretense, hopefully the person messing with you will visit the website and you should have some more information regarding whoever it is.	If they have access to your virtual machines you should probably just reinstall. Once you've been rooted there's no good way to be sure.	1
What’s the most NSFW part of your job?	I work in security. One company hired us to pentest their server. We got in to the server and discovered that 1 dude in said company was hiding a lot of porn on there..	Doing child safeguarding training every year. Seeing images of the bruises inside kids mouths that were caused by an adults penis. I run a dental practice	0
Married men of reddit: what was that dumb thing you did during your dating phase that you can’t believe your wife ended up overlooking?	I shot her with an air soft gun. I was on the 3rd floor of my apartment, as she pulled into the parking lot with her friend. As soon as she got out of the car I began shooting. I got them pinned down pretty quickly. I thought I heard them laughing, but they were actually crying. The woman who would eventually become my wife stood up and screamed for me to stop.	I get very nervous around women that are into me and especially when I know she's watching me do something. Even something trivial. On an early date, we went to the local shop to pick up some things for a picnic, including some gum. I was thinking really hard and aware that I was being watched. I had this. Money on the counter, gum in your mouth. Money on the counter, gum in your mouth. Easy. Suffice to say when I put the gum on the counter and the €2 coin in my mouth, the cashier was baffled and my girlfriend (now wife) was crying with laughter.	0
"If Bill Gates drops a $100 bill, it literally is not worth his time to stop walking and pick it up." What other "popular facts" piss you off for being non factual?	Men think about sex every 7 second. Why do so many people believe this? You'd think that men who don't think about sex that often wouldn't be fooled by that stat.	People tell me that having sex with my daughter is perverted. Attention everybody, I'm just practicing new positions before I try them on my wife!!!!	1
I got my husband to stop leaving socks on the floor by stealing the abandoned socks and stitching them into sock creatures, then putting them back where he left the sock. How did you get your SO to stop doing things you don't like?	I hate that my husband moans I don't do as much housework as him when he gets up and washes up and tidies up before I've even woken up. I think hes trying to make a point or something, however while hes keeping the house tidy and giving me a lie in I feel I win!!	Ferrets make fantastic sock wranglers. I never have to pick up my socks anymore, I just have to forage in his hiding spot once a week on laundry day.	0
How does one approach shy people?	With caution. Once you break that shell you may discover nothing more than a shell of a human being. Like a Russian doll. Relentlessly requiring you to break through that last shell untill you realize there's nothing for you here. No connection. Just more self protective narcissism.	As a shy person, never leave it to them to initiate the conversation, they won't. Start with some basic small talk. They will also likely not have a clue what to talk about, so you guiding the conversation is probably best. Finally, patience is needed, they're nervous as fuck and you just put them in an uncomfortable position.	0
I watched Toy Story 3 with my 5 year old cousin, after saying it was a sad ending she laughed at me and told me to "grow up". What has a child said to you to make you feel like shit?	I'm a babysitter. One time the little girl asked me, "Why are you always free on Saturday nights? You must not have any friends."	your cousin was probably parroting a reaction she personally received from one or both of her parents. which i would personally argue reflects negatively on their parenting skills. potentially a lesser authority though, like a teacher or such. regardless, id be concerned for her emotional and psychological development.	1
Divorced people of reddit: I don't want to sound like a dick but, help us learn from your mistakes. What went wrong that could have been prevented?	* Rule #1. Don't get married. * Rule #2. If you do get married, don't get married before you're 30 years old. * Rule #3. If you do get married before you're 30 years old, don't have children. * Rule #4. If you do get married before you're 30 years old and have children, then the best thing you can do is to teach them Rule #1	It sounds dumb, but the best advice I didn't take was that even though you're married...hell ESPECIALLY because you're married...you have to remember you're still two individual people. You don't have to like everything they like. They don't have to like everything you like. Your whole life CANNOT be the other person. You lose you and you lose them in the process. That was one of the biggest mistakes with me and my ex. He was the be all end all of my world. I lost so very many friends in the process because he didn't like them. If the other person wants you to assimilate...it's probably not worth it.	0
Reddit, what's the weirdest phone call you have ever received?	Last spring, I tweeted something to the effect of, "I wish I could do my homework outside, but there's no where to plug my laptop into." Almost immediately after, I got a phone call from a number I didn't recognize, with a creepy voice saying, "We've got outlets in the treeeeeeeessss."	So, I was making out with my gf one time when my phone rang. I answered, and the guy on the other end asks what I'm doing with his daughter. I tell my gf that her dad has called me. That's when she tells me her father was dead...	1
What secret will you take to your grave?	I found out that my neighbors were abusing and neglecting their cat, not feeding it for days, hitting him, locking him in closets, screaming at him, not having a litter box or letting him outside so when he would poop in the house they would beat him more. He was a cute little black and white cat. So when they were at work I went in to their house, took their cat and gave it to my cousin whos cat had died the week before. He is now happy and spoiled. they didn't even really look for their cat. Assholes	That I've actively searched for an jacked off to child porn. That I've had sex dreams involving family. (grossed out when I wake up). That I've made my ladycat cum before...real odd. Uhhh...All I can think of...	1
Godparents of reddit who had to assume the role of parenting your godchild: Can you explain the process, and how things turned out?	My godparents became my guardians when I was two. It turned out alright I guess. I definitely could have wound up in a far worse situation, but I think not being their biological child hurt me in a few ways. They were always *so* much more overprotective of me, to the point where I was suicidal for a while because I felt like nothing I did was ever right. My siblings did whatever the hell they wanted, but if I so much as went out for dinner with a friend, it was like I committed murder. I've kind of always felt like a black sheep too.	Well I first notice that the parents of a young girl were treating her terribly. Her parents would spoil their other daughters and reduce this poor child to medial physical labor. So one night, I noticed she was particularly sad as her sisters got to go out to ball as she was left behind to do chores. Feeling Empathetic I put some psychedelic drugs in here drink(Cosby style) thinking she might enjoy a nice break from reality. Unfortunately, I guess I gave were way to much cause she just started rambling about Pumpkin carriages and glass slippers. Poor girl. Edit: I guess no one likes disney princesses.	1
What's your best "I can't believe we got away with that" story?	One summer I used to sneak out almost every night. One night I went through my normal routine of getting ready to go. I snuck down the stairs trying to make as little noise as possible. I opened the door walked out and reached in my pocket to find my keys to lock the door, but they weren't there. So I went back inside, up the stairs, and into my bedroom to look for my keys. While I was in my room I heard my parents door open, so I got into bed and pretended to be asleep, about a minute later my mother walked in to check if I was asleep. I couldn't believe how lucky I was to have left my keys. TL;DR A game of hide and seek with my keys saved me from my mother.	TL;DR: [Murder](/spoiler) ME and my friends broke into a house one day. One went of to find something of interest well me and the other one did some Cocaine. We were high, energetic and i got the most of it. Next house, i was left guard. My friends were inside and i saw a man approaching. I panicked and stabbed him until he died. Turns out he was my friends boss. [Reference is *Horrible Bosses*](/spoiler)	1
What's your best "I told you so" story?	My previous bosses insisted that our sluggish sales were because my staff were too old and unattractive. This is at the height of Las Vegas being brutalized by foreclosure and job loss. I told them for around a year what was going on here to no avail. They finally terminated myself and the entire staff and replaced them with far less qualified but younger and more attractive people. The business has been bleeding money since and a significant portion of the clients I'd built up over the years have stopped going there. In the end it's doing worse than when they sent me in to fix it 9 years previous. Told you so!	I BEGGED my dad to buy shares in Apple in 2002 and Google in 2004. I used to play around in the stock market as a kid using fake money and I was so sure that these "cool" companies would be great buys. If he put $10000 into either I'd be driving a new R8 right now just for my "told you so" commission. I "tell him so" every time I see him	1
What's the strangest thing you've seen at a funeral?	The ex-girlfriend of my best friend committed suicide about a year ago, and since I have several friends who knew her, I ended up attending. Girl was a total weeb, attended cons on a regular basis, etc., So her parents encouraged people to come in cosplay. What followed was the worst event I've ever seen. ~100 people showed up in varying degrees of cringe. They played Black Veil Brides at the ceremony and everyone was dancing. She was buried in cosplay of some Vampire Knight character. I wanted to be the one being buried. At least the food was good.	Strangest/best: when my friend died in a freak accident his brothers performed an interpretive dance to Circle of Life. I laughcried so much I nearly hyperventilated.	0
[serious] With the anniversary of 9/11 tomorrow, where were you and what was your experience when you found out the Twin Towers were attacked?	I was about 14, sitting in my German class, the teacher got a phone call and turned on the TV to the news. It didn't really affect me, terrorist attacks happen all the time and I find it difficult to care about the misery of people in foreign countries.	I was in my first year of college. Since I didn't have class that morning I slept in. I woke up around eleven and went to my friend's house. On the drive over there was no music on the radio, just talking heads taking about something big on every station. It had already happened. The world had changed while I slept in. I got to my friend's house and watched replays and replays for hours.	0
What phrases do you hate and why?	Work place jargon. Usually anything with "synergy" or "leverage" or "robust". These words don't even mean anything anymore, or even when they're used correctly, it's just annoying when you could've obviously just used normal words like "work together" or "use this" or "effective" but you're trying to jazz it up or whatever.	"You can't have your cake and eat it too." What the hell am I supposed to do with it then?	1
What’s the best response when someone knocks on the bathroom door while you’re taking a dump?	I have yelled "No!" I was startled I guess and the lock on the door didnt look reliable. She was also startled...	Don't say anything. Reach into your toilet bowl and take out your fresh poops and toss it over the stall door so that it hits the person who knocked and then leave.	1
As a barista, I always get that customer who orders a "cappuccino with absolutely no foam," in a very confident manner. I just smile and make them a latte. What things do you pretend to go along with every day, just so someone else can feel better about themselves?	Reminds me of a cafe in Vietnam. There was a tourist who'd clearly heard that ice-coffee (ca phe sua da) was a Vietnamese speciality, but that it was not safe to drink the water or ice. So he ordered an ice-coffee without ice. The poor waitress was so confused. She suggested that maybe he meant hot coffee? But no, he wanted ice-coffee. Just without ice. After a going round this loop a few times he was given hot coffee and a glass of ice, and left to sort it out himself!	I don't do this. I call people when they mess up. If you do not tell them they will never learn. I also do not think it is fair to have to just put up with someone being wrong to spare their feelings. Your feelings of annoyance matter too.	1
Hey Reddit, what's one unfortunate thing you've realized or learned about life as you have gotten older?	When I was a kid, my dad always told me "Thomas, you're lucky if you have one truly good friend in life. If you have one, count it blessing. If you have more than that, you are very lucky." As a kid, I had tons of "friends" and I thought it was silly. As I have gotten older, I've realized how true what he said was. It's not that we don't have lots of friends in our lives but the truly close friends, the ones who sit in the mud with you when shit goes wrong, the ones who you can trust with anything, those kinds of friends are very rare and should be cherished.	Government does not exist to serve the people, the only thing that changes in an election is the faces. No matter what party wins we are still fucked.	1
What’s the silliest disagreement you and your SO have had?	She’s always yelling and screaming to get out of the basement like bitch I give you food and a roof over your head don’t scream for the cops.	The nursery rhyme "This little piggy"? Whether the fourth little piggy has "some" or "none". My mother called him in the middle of the argument and I didn't hear his phone ring, just saw him playing with it and then heard my mum's voice. I immediately screamed "did you call my mother to settle this? She's not going to help you! She's the one that taught me the damn song!" My mum had called to check in on my husband's health. She never weighed in on the argument, she called us idiots and hung up.	0
What are some small things you can do everyday to remind everyone that you're an asshole?	The smallest, but most effective behavior ever, keep clicking a pen. This can go either two ways from here, they ask you to stop, to which you say sorry, then continue after 5 minutes. Or they deem it appropriate and they start doing it too, to which you then say, can you please not do that? Enjoy watching them boil with rage.	Use a wheelchair because your fat and lazy, not for a medical reason. I shit you not, I was at a concert last night and there was a wheelchair planted on the rail. The guy who owned it used it to save his space and was *walking* to and from the bathroom/bar and also at points would stand during the show. Lazy, entitled, piece of human garbage that is everything wrong with America.	1
Lately, many women named Karen are probably unhappily walking around with a name that is suddenly code for a mean, entitled person. Is there someone you know who suffers every day with a name forced upon them at birth?	When my daughter was in middle school, her friend's mom was Katrina. After the hurricane of that name hit, she called in to volunteer to help out. After they asked her what her name was, they instantly hung up on her.	My wife’s name has European origin and is one letter off from a common American name. She gets called the wrong name constantly, even in print where she clearly spells out her own name on paperwork. Edited for clarity.	1
If High Fuel Prices Are The Cause of High Food Prices, As We Are Told, Then When Are Food Prices Going To Plummet Like Gasoline Has?	The current high prices for milk and beef in the usa are more related to the ongoing drought in several production areas rather than the price of fuel. Also remember that gasoline is under $2/gallon but diesel fuel is much more expensive still and most farm equipment runs off diesel.	1) Stop Writing Like This, It's Obnoxious. Capitals are meant for the beginning of sentences and for names. 2) High gas is only one of the reasons for high food prices because of delivery but there are other factors, the likelihood of a major price drop is very slim.	1
What are some of those things that you find so goddamn attractive that are not the normal cliche/popular ideals?	I like men who are slightly awkward in their bodies i.e., they bounce when they walk, they swing their arms in a strange way. I have no idea why this is.	dimples above ass, flat stomach and a tight waistline. If you have all those then its game over for me.	1
Multilinguals of Reddit, what is your "they didn't know I could understand their language" story?	I'm a white guy who has been living in Singapore for the last two years. I speak fluent mandarin. I hear a lot of people talking about me but one of the cutest moments was as I was walking out of the train an older lady looked up at me in shock and said "wow handsome man" to her friend in mandarin I replied "wow pretty woman" as we walked by each other. It couldn't have lasted longer that a few seconds. The last thing I saw was her blushing and her friend laughing at her as the doors closed.	I'll flip the script. White male Chinese speaker here. I was at an internet bar in SE Asia a few years back. Everyone in the place was of non East-Asian ancestry, including the young blonde woman sat next to me. I called my GF and spoke to her in Mandarin over Skype. Nothing too raunchy, but some standard private romantic partner talk. After chatting with my GF and saying goodbye the blonde lady on my left turns to me and says "啊，你也会说中文吧。“ Turns out she grew up in Chongqing.	1
As an adult, what has ruined a friendship?	Shitty girlfriends/wives I'm the free spirited successful guy friend that is still out there dating with zero plans to ever settle down. The girlfriends/wives hate that when I am around their dudes they start to realize that they are stuck with these fat evil mean harpies.. so they make sure I am not able to see my buddies. We make plans and usually the day before I get a call or text "uh.. hi.. I can't make it.. I have to do such and such for the woman and gain some wife points" Fucking ridiculous.	Never reaching out on getting together. I was always the one asking if they were available to hangout. They were always willing to do something and we always had a good time, but after a while it felt like a one way street. Once I stopped with the invites and they just fell off the face of the planet. Every once in a while a Facebook comment "Haven't see you forever! Let's hangout soon", or a big party situation (like a birthday), but that's where it stopped. I've had this happen multiple times in my adulthood... wait, maybe I'm the problem?! No, they suck! That's the problem!	0
What lesson did you learn the hard way?	That women will always eventually go for the douche bags and I should never even try to make romantic acquantince.	Actually put effort into choosing your college major. "I like chemistry and math" does not mean you will enjoy chemical engineering.	0
What sentence would you have if you tapped the middle button of your phones autocorrect 20 times?	I am going to be in the polls and I will get you the sheet music and the other is a field trip.	I just got home and I don't think I'm going to the gym today and it is not the same	0
Grandparents disown me, wish I was dead; now years later, they're dying and my other family members are telling them that I've begged forgiveness even though I haven't. What do I do?	Analysis of consequences. You owe these people nothing, but you owe yourself an outcome you can live with. Keep the peace or spit in their faces, but do it because it's what's best for you, not because it's what they deserve. Otherwise you're still just under their control.	re: your grandmother: Let it go. You will not benefit in any way from contacting her and telling her the truth. re: your mother: This is presumably your mother's mother, yes? The death of her mother is hers to deal with. Any steps you take to the contrary will wreck her, and that's probably not what you want to do. re: your sister. Give her a hug and thank her for the sound advice, apart from "don't you dare...". Just continue to avoid contact with your grandmother. She'll be gone soon enough. Dance a little jig on her grave if you feel like it.	1
[NSFW] What was your worst one night stand experience?	Brought her home but she didn't want sex but she wanted to grind while making out. Ended up with fabric burns on my dick and she stole my shorts. They were my favorite shorts.	My one night stand was wild, and beautiful. Was in the room just hanging out having a good time. It went wrong when I stubbed by toe and the nail fell off. It was very nsfw.	1
What are some free services many are unaware of?	If you pay to spend time with a girl they will have sex with you for free, so I hear.	A lot of museums are actually free. Museums such as the metropolitan and the museum natural history have a "suggested price". However that's all it is, a suggestion. You can pay what ever you want.	0
What's the weirdest thing you've ever caught someone doing?	This one is my shame, i was cycling home from work a couple of years back, was wearing lycra 3/4 length bib shorts and it was raining + bloody cold, around a mile from home i was busting for a piss so decided, as i was soaking wet it wouldn't matter if i pissed myself as i was going to wash the kit anyway, in my mind i though that it would just soak into the material, couldn't fucking believe it when it just started arcing out of me straight through the lycra, absolutely no resistance at all, sadly i was cycling past a full bus stop, i can still see the look of confusion/laughter/shock on people's faces as i "wizzed" by.	I once flew to Tulsa to surprise my husband while he was there on business. I got a a key from the front desk and let myself into the room... where I caught him watching shark porn. Weird! So then I had to call my friends from the bathroom and get advice.	1
When I was 16 I thought police wouldn't pull me over late at night if I used cruise control, What moronic thoughts did you have when you were younger?	I believed everything I learned at Sunday school. Then I found out adults really didn't know that any of it was true and that it was actually bunk.	A friend in high school thought it was illegal for kids under 18 to buy condoms. Both 16, both virgins, both parents nine months later.	0
[UPDATE] I've created an imaginary person 10 years ago, and now he's become completely integral to my life. What do I do?	Hello. We don't know each other (and perhaps never will till your novel comes out) but I think there are underlying feelings of hurt that you've kept with you in order to construe this lie.	Wouldn't it be crazy if Brad just showed up some gathering, asking why you haven't spoken to him in months? And everyone demanded to know why you're acting so weird to him lately. You then explained to everyone Brad isn't real and you have no idea who this man is, but then everyone started showing their cell phone pics of you embracing each other at your last birthday or something. This could be a premise of a movie.	0
Have you ever quit a job after the first day? What made you quit?	Worked 2 days at a car wash. Day 2, saw a customer hand the manager a tip for the guy who had just finished cleaning the interior. The guy who had cleaned it went inside for a drink of water, as the customer was taking a second. Anyways, the manager pocketed the tip and told the employee that he got stiffed. Told my new coworker, told the manager I changed my mind about working there, and never went back.	I worked at Hardee's for 3 hours. They said since I was 18, I was old enough to slice the meat, so I'd be the meat slicer (not exclusively), but I was really too short for the machine, so I didn't want to slice it. Plus the decor was brown. And it was boring. I never went back. Or got my check.	1
What was the most "only in my country" moment you have witnessed?	Kid worked all summer as a life guard to save money. He rescued a drowning swimmer. Ambulance came an insisted he also get in and go for a check up. They billed him more than he would make in 3 summers.	American here. I went paintballing a couple of years ago and ended up in a sort of shootout with another guy. We went for a beer afterwards and I found out he had German and Japanese heritage. But, get this: I am about 25% English, 25% French, with a bit of Russian as well. We literally recreated the alliances of WWII - with paintball.	1
Redditor's who won one of those "do x with a celebrity" or "spend a day with so and so", what were those actually like?	This was abt 10 years ago. Won a meet & great with Britney Spears before her concert thru local radio station. We were warned on the night by one of her staff, that she can be rather shy & it was 50/50 as to whether we'd actually get the meet & if we were to meet her, we were told definitely don't touch her. Sounds harsh, but in hindsight I wouldnt want randoms back stage touching me either. We were in luck, got to meet her v briefly, took a couple of snaps where she put her arms around us & then watched the gig front row. She was much smaller than you think & was lovely in that little moment. Show was excellent too. Thanks Britney. Edited to correct spelling & date	My Grandpa once smoked a joint with Mickey Rafael (Willie Nelson’s harmonica player). He does not remember what he was like, God-knows-why.	1
What little thing do people do that takes your anger from 0 to 100 instantly?	They say "Sorry" in an angry 'fuck you' type of way when they are apologizing for something THEY did wrong.	Being cut up on the road. People that merge into by braking zone. When people praise Coldplay for their "talent". Dog owners. Vape culture.	1
People who have been kidnapped, if comfortable, whats your story?	One time when I was 4 some lady tried to take me out of the shoe store to my mom, but my mom was standing in the other aisle. I started to cry and freak out and my mom came running. The lady was like "Shes okay i'm just taking her to her mom". My mom said "I'm her mom." That bitch ran off hella fast.	Mine technically isn't kidnapping because they didn't take us anywhere but back in high school I was at a friend's house when he was the victim of a home invasion.	1
What movie lost its charm when you re-watched it as an adult?	I watched the Inspector Gadget movie a few months ago because I remember loving it as a kid. I've never been so disappointed.	Superbad. It's so cringey. I mean I was like 14 when I first saw it so idk if that counts.	1
What was your most unfair punishment at school?	I was told to go sit in the hall in fifth grade and told off because, instead of reading the first few chapters of *The Giver*, I read the entire thing in one sitting. Apparently reading ahead because I liked the story was frowned upon. It's not like I told anyone else answers to the discussion questions or anything, I just... read. And yeah, I didn't exactly read it 100% thoroughly but we were given a bit to read it.	I told a teacher that she sucked at teaching to her face once...... everyone including my mother and the other teachers agreed with me....	1
What are your relationship "hard no" deal breakers? Even if everything else was perfect about them, what quality or behavior kills any chance of being in a relationship with you?	Treating me like a domestic servant/replacement mother. I've had a few relationships where I had to walk away because the guy was starting to stop taking care of the house/themselves and expected me to take care of the cooking, cleaning and errands 100% while both working 8hr a day desk jobs. No fucking way. Never again. I'm engaged to a man who acts likes grown adult and not a 6 year old, thank god.	Being a republican/conservative. And especially a Trump supporter. Nope. Add to that list anyone who's bigoted in any way. A person who doesn't have empathy or respect for others. A guy who's in a codependent relationship with a controlling/enmeshed mother.. my biggest red flag and dealbreaker ever. Btdt, no thank you.	1
What's the scariest thing you've ever witnessed on a casual day?	I used to be a member of the YMCA in a gay part of time. There would be old naked guy happy hour in the locker-room, and they were not shy about checking you out and making comments.	I left work for lunch walking to a restaurant just 2 blocks away. As I rounded the corner a car accident happens right in front of me. A lady walking just 10 feet in front of me is hit and pinned between the car and a building. She was concious and mad as hell. Despite her legs being obviously broken she let loose a stream of verbal abuse on the driver about her shoes, her dress, her phone, everything except her injuries. It was surreal.	0
What ruins an otherwise good restaurant experience?	American style wait staff. The fake sincerity and smiles, and the pressure to fake sincerity back ruins the experience of going out. I am paying the staff for their services, I don't need them to pretend its anything more than that. I only want to interact with them when they're dropping off food or drinks, or I catch their eye to order more food or drinks. Otherwise, please leave me alone to enjoy the company of the people I chose to go out with. I'm an adult: I know when I want another glass of wine. Professionally distant staff are *the best*	Loud devices. My boyfriend and I were at a tiny restaurant, and some kid was watching an obnoxiously loud cartoon on a tablet or a phone. The kid was glued to it, and his parents were talking over it, oblivious to the fact that it was annoying as hell. But whatever, as long as your kid doesn't interrupt your conversation, right?	0
People who lost their virginity after age 35 (or never did), what's your story?	Women don't like me and I can't figure out why since they won't tell me. I don't get it. I'm well educated and making a very decent living, certainly that ought to count for something but nooooooo	I'm gonna be completely honest here. I'm 38, tomorrow is my 39th birthday and I'm still a virgin because nobody wants me. I'm boring and ugly. I could give elaborate excuses, like I spent a lot of time taking care of my Dad which, although true, aren't the true cause of the problem. What makes it worse is that the longer it goes on, the harder it gets to go out and meet people. You either don't want people to know or if they do know then there's a stigma attached to being an (almost) 40 year old virgin.	0
People who keep an eye on security cameras, what's the most bizzare/disgusting thing you have seen happening?	I saw a cop take a shit between two slices of bread. He then placed the "turd burger" in a styrofoam box and gave it to a homeless guy. **nasty**	Nuclear security here. We're on a river. Our cameras have some decent zoom capabilities and we have seen a few couples get it on on the shore on the other side of the river. The most interesting thing I think would be the deer and the coyotes. A pack of coyotes chased a deer around on the frozen river until it fell in the water right next to our intake. Well it froze to death with just the neck and head sticking above the ice. The coyotes lost interest but a mother and baby bobcat would come over every night and chew on it. The wildlife is definitely the best part of our nights usually. That and Netflix.	0
If America and North Korea actually do go to war, what can we realistically expect to happen?	Realistically it will be a horrible war. Korean agents within the states will set off dirty bombs, quite possible biological agents and what not. Also its already been proven by NASA, the armed forces and other government agencies and the like, NK had the technology to hit as far as boston, but not with a large warhead. Right now they could hit denver with a 25-50 ton warhead which would do far less damage then something like what alot of chinas, russias, and usa nukes could do. Alot of destruction and death yes, but not the end of the world. And realistically it would either be shot down or the only one theyd fire before we nuke them into oblivion.	SK would get bombed to shit. NK would get bombed to shit. USA would get a few missiles that they may or may not catch. Result: A "free" NK with millions of refugees, and somethingsomething a clusterfuck of a cleanup, and someonesomeone fiddle around to grap power, maybe a general, maybe china, maybe a unified Korea, whatever the case. Theyll have millions of uneducated indoctrinated people and an underdeveloped landmass.	0
What is the most unbelievable thing that a stranger has done to you?	When I was about 10, I went to an EB games in the mall to buy Diablo II Battle Chest. As the cashier was ringing me out, he asked "Do you have a guardian with you?", as I hesitantly looked around the store trying to think of a response. All of a sudden I hear "Yes, I'm his grandmother" from a little old woman behind me. He cleared me and I was good to go. Minor, but I always think of how cool that was of her!	I was leaving a bar/lounge after my buddy's birthday thing. Some dude standing on the wall (seems a little intoxicated) calls me over to him and says that I look just like his son who passed away. Naturally, I said "sorry to hear that man". This guy started grabbing my arms and shoulders and started rubbing my face so I pushed him off. He grabs me again and starts leaning in to kiss me, so I knocked him out cold.	1
I accidentally told a stranger I was from his home town. What elaborate white lies have you told for no particular reason?	Best Buy Cashier: ...and can I get your Zip code? Me, (politely lying): Sorry, I just moved here and I haven't memorized it. C: Where from? M: Portland C: Really? Why did you move? M: I wonder that myself. This town is a shit hole.	This last weekend I was with a med student getting drinks at a bar when this older couple started talking to us. About 15 minutes into the conversation I realized that they thought I was also a medical student. They were buying us drinks and I didn't have the courage to tell them the truth because they were talking about how great it was seeing that young people are still good people. We made up that I was 2nd in our class, that my buddy was the people person and I was the guy who just gives the bad news and leaves, that I was in orthopedics, and about 45 minutes more of lies. I felt bad , but I was impressed we were able to keep up the lie.	1
What's the most outrageous price to an item you've ever encountered?	Someone has conveniently made a page of the most outrageously priced items on the internet for this very purpose. www.apple.com Enjoy!	It was a Bank Charge. So it's kind of not an item, but we made a donation to an overseas company, the bank took $99 million dollars out of our account instead of the $740 they were supposed to, which was a mistake, but then they wanted to charge us $413,000 in interest for our account being overdrawn for one day. I actually got a call from the bank manager saying we needed to pay the money. I kindly (not) explained to him to go re-check his paperwork and to never call me again.	0
Dear Reddit , what is a piece of advice that annoys you?	You can't retire until you have a million plus. Yes you can, it's called moving to a country your income exceeds your expenses and retiring years earlier. Screw this 67.5 years expectation to get the money back from SS/IRA's etc.	Any time your place of employment tells you that you "need to be a team player". In my experience that means, "look, we're going to fuck you sometimes. Just loosen your asshole for the good of the company. It'll hurt less, slugger."	0
Reddit, what are your wedding horror stories?	At my sister's wedding reception my Mom's cousin asked to sing, and was told firmly, no. So she got drunk, took the mic from the DJ and started singing, leaving her old-enough-to-know-better, rotten, never-disciplined child unattended, and the child ran her fingers along the wedding cake and other deserts, and then, the child got a cup of coffee and spilled it on my sisters VERY expensive french lace vintage wedding dress. They are no longer invited to family functions.	Was my wedding day. Friends of my wife ask if I want to drive around real quick and smoke a bowl. Hell yea I do! On the way back we get lost. People start noticing the groom is missing. Wife gets pissed and pulls me to another room to tell me how much. Her sisters see this and start asking questions. Should have just hit it real quick and stayed. Next time....lol	1
What makes you feel alive?	Rain. There's just something about the smell and the feeling of cold drops hitting my face. It's peaceful listening the drops hit the ground (especially now with the leaves on the ground).	Being a woman. 26 years of being a man felt like I was just a passenger. The last 2 years I've actually experienced living.	1
Today I received a package in the mail containing my brand new iPhone 4 that I lost last summer at a beach house. Last week a woman who rented the place found my phone, charged it up, looked up my contact info, and mailed it to me. What's the nicest thing a complete stranger has ever done for you?	After being mugged at gunpoint in D.C. the guys who mugged me must have thrown my wallet in a trash can. A homeless man mailed it back to me at his own expense. I got back my license, social security card(PITA to replace) and a few other precious things that I thought I'd lost forever(including my wallet). He wrote a short letter explaining who he was and telling me to basically "pay it forward". I wish I could have gotten a chance to thank him somehow.	I sat on my left hand until it fell asleep. Then it brought me to orgasm. Felt like a complete stranger.	1
I have wanted to ask this for sometime now so here it is. Reddit what are some high paying, high demand jobs, that are highly obscure?	I'm a drug mule, and I frequently smuggle coke across the border. Pays well, but you can only fit so many 2L bottles up there	Translators/interpreters for some specific languages can make a lot. If you can translate between Arabic and Hebrew, for example, you'll be in high demand.	0
Redditors who were previously child-free (by choice) but who are now parents: what made you change your mind and decide to have a child?	GF had her tubes tied. Was adamant hating having kids. Spent a bunch of times with the wilder crowds. Dont wanna know her stories. Bought a weird ring at an auction, proposed marriage. Car accident provided some cash. Got the sterilization reversed. LOTS of work to have two kids. failed with one.. now the 3rd (we call him the Beta and don't mention the 2nd that was lost) is offered a free ride at San Jose.	Married for 17 years, almost 40 & happy being child free. Marriage, life, hobbies, income, etc all good. Always had a VERY small part of me that wasn't 100% sure I didn't want kids and afraid I'd regret it. One day, had the thought "I might regret not having kids... But I know I won't regret it if I do". Talked to husband, agreed to try for 3 months & at least say we tried. Third month, pregnant, now a mom to a healthy, happy 16 month old. It's way harder than I thought and way better than I thought too.	0
Has your pet ever displayed intelligence far beyond the capacity you thought it had? If yes, what did it do?	Once my dog grabbed a sandwich wrap from the counter and tried to sneak it from the kitchen, through the living room that we were in, and into the dining room. He knew if he ran, he would draw attention to himself, so he walked very slowly with the roll in his mouth. He didn't end up succeeding. He drew attention because he was walking slower than he ever does. Still, the fact that he had the brain capacity to come up with this plan and attempt to execute it amazes me.	one ate itself to death while the other presumably starved and shat itself to death...they both got dug up from the shallow grave by cats	1
Well endowed men of reddit. What's it like to be able to reach to bottom of a Pringles can?	Most of the time, if you hit the bottom of the pringles can, it's gonna be uncomfortable for the pringles can and you have to start doing other positions where you don't get so deep.	Some people call me Pringles Dick But I never really found out why I don't really have a Pringles dick I just keep my dick inside I keep my dick inside a Pringles can Because it keeps my penis safe and dry Some people call me Pringles Dick But I never really found out No, I never found out I never really found out why	1
Employers and managers who had to fire their best employee - what happened?	When i worked at a food processing plant, I was employee of the year 3 of the 6 years there. Then we got a new pickle slicer and I could not stop thinking about putting my penis in there. Went on for weeks until one day, I just finally did it. Put my penis in the pickle slicer. At break. Got caught. Got fired. They fired the girl slicing pickles too.	We hire a lot of people in recovery who are a part of the drug court program under the condition that they will be terminated if they go back to jail for drug/alcohol charges. This coworker was our hardest worker and always picked up shifts and got tons of compliments, so it really sucked when she relapsed and failed her pee test with drug court, she got sent to jail for a week and we had to fire her. I still kept in touch with her, and when I found out she was pregnant, I convinced my boss to hire her back. One last chance. I'm so happy I wasn't wrong because she's about to celebrate her 4th year of sobriety and she's now management.	0
Without needing to know the context, what is the best paragraph in any book?	>It is easy to overlook this thought that life just is. As humans we are inclined to feel that life must have a point. We have plans and aspirations and desires. We want to take constant advantage of the intoxicating existence we've been endowed with. But what's life to a lichen? Yet its impulse to exist, to be , is every bit as strong as ours-arguably even stronger. If I were told that I had to spend decades being a furry growth on a rock in the woods, I believe I would lose the will to go on. Lichens don't. Like virtually all living things, they will suffer any hardship, endure any insult, for a moment's additions existence. Life, in short just wants to be. - Bill Bryson, *A Short History of Nearly Everything*	> In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony god’s blessing. But because, I am enlightened by my intelligence. The God Delusion - Richard Dawkins	1
What's the most WTF comment a complete stranger ever made towards you?	I was also 16 when this happened. I have very fair skin and had not yet discovered the magical properties of foundation/blush. A substitute teacher at my school told me I "need to get some sun" because my "face is pasty and disgusting".	If anyone I know reddits, I expect to see a few quotes of something I've said. I just can't help it, I always end up saying something moronic	1
Alcohol drinkers of the world, what is your country's drinking custom?	In America, for some reason we have to play a fucking game that involves drinking like beerpong or flipcup. It's unaccaptable to just sit down and enjoy your fucking beer apperently. Also people have shit taste for beers, so it is always necessary to bring your own sixer to any party so you don't have to down 15 pisswaters just to get a buzz.	England (student) - Typical night starts of drinking copious amounts of whatever is cheapest at Bargain Booze, quick TC (tactical chunder) before going out followed by even more drinking in the cheapest night club you can find. If you find a nice (or easy) girl head back to hers, if not get even more wasted throw up. Head to the local chippy or kebab shop, drunkly order a shit ton of food. Head back home. Wake up the next day surrounded by cheesy chips and no idea what happened last night.	0
What do most people not notice are actually advertisements?	Some kids’ shows are created for the sole purpose advertising toy lines. From my childhood in the 1980s, these included He-Man, GI Joe, and Transformers. I’m sure there are more recent examples, but those are the ones I know.	many of the answers on jeopardy. and also, when the shill trebek stares straight into the camera and says he'd like to thank so and so for giving the video clues. i no longer watch jeopardy.	1
What was the dumbest rule your parents had growing up?	I am the oldest of three brothers. Any time I would "graduate" to getting allowed to do something because they deemed me old enough to, my younger brothers would get the same permission at the same time. This wasn't a rule per se, just something that happened a lot. For instance: later bedtime, being able to watch PG-13 movies, being able to watch R movies, being able to stay out late with friends. This may seem trivial, but I ended up having a much more sheltered life than either of my brothers.	Ah yes, the confusion of down under. This is off topic but how the hell does summer break work down there. Is it just in like December?	1
Does anyone think (or know for sure) that they've met someone in the Witness Protection Program? What made you think that?	I hope everybody posting in this thread realizes that Witness Protection exists for a fucking reason. Unless you are altering every single detail of your story then you may very well be getting somebody killed. Getting an entire family killed. For that matter, telling the story with the details changed may also get an unexpecting family killed.	My manager definitely has some skeletons in his closet. He goes out of his way to avoid recognition in the store. Dark glasses, visor worn so low it almost covers his eyes, 70's mustache...the whole nine yards. One day, I swear he thought he was recognized by some thuggish looking guy, but it turned out he was looking at someone else. The guy was practically shitting himself when the guy passed him by. So much drama at the Omaha Cinnabon.	0
What is the most useful tattoo you can think of?	A QR code, which links to a hidden website on my home server that initiates a script that deletes my internet history. For the curious, tech-savy cop that finds my dead body.	Criminal convictions on the back of someones hand. Petty crime gets 1 small black dot, 3 or more petty crimes forms a triangle with the dots connected. Non-threatening crimes like fraud and tax evasion get a large black dot and threatening crimes get a large red dot.	1
What embarrassing childhood incident haunts you to this day?	When I was about 6 years old my older brother taught me the word "horny." He neglected, however, to teach me what it meant. I wandered downstairs to the kitchen and announced to my parents, "I'm horny!" ...Though I imagine this story may haunt my brother more than it does me, given the amount of trouble he got into.	Well I don't want to talk about it oh god why FUCK YOU LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE I STILL CAN'T FUCKING SLEEP AT NIGHT.	1
What modern day books (lets say last 20 years or so) do you think will be considered classic literature in the future?	I feel really bad for all the kids in the future who have to find the deep meaning in Harry Potter...	Gotta be Harry Potter. At this point if you don't see the impact and cultural relevance and all the complexities that exist to be found in the texts, you're being willfully stupid, you're not as cool as you think you are , and you don't enjoy literature for the sake of literature, you use it as a means to fellate your own ego. Also Patrick Rothfuss's The Name of the Wind is better written fantasy fiction than anything George Martin ever created and might one day deserve to be in the same breath as Tolkien's work	1
Non-Americans who have visited the US: What surprised you the most about the US, and what surprised you the least?	Most: that there are parts of cities where people are afraid to go out of fear of being robbed Least: everyone was fat.	Friends from Ireland were astonished by the mailbox. See, I put in a letter, and lift this little flag up, and that lets the mail carrier know that I have a letter to mail. After he picks it up, he puts the little flag down, and I know he's been there. "Feckin' brilliant, dat."	0
What's the most pain you've ever been in?	A sneeze. I've been shot (once), stabbed (twice), had gall stones, kidney stones, and pancreatitis, but that sneeze was the worst. I had open heart surgery (congenitally bad heart valve). They gave me a little pillow and told me to hug it tight if I felt a sneeze coming on. I thought they were crazy but kept it close. Next day, sneezed without warning. I ceased to exist as a person. The universe and all in it ceased to exist. Reality was a single point of formless, featureless pain, exquisite in its purity, unparalleled in its intensity.	An emotional relationship that I had for 4 years with my SO who I thought I was my soul mate. We’re on break rn and just hearing the possibility of being left alone like that has me broken with physical pain.	1
Reddit, have you ever experienced a single moment of clarity that made you realize you don't want to be friends with a particular person any longer?	I had a friend where everything I got into, he got into more. I loved climbing so he went to El Capitan. I liked a girl, he dated her. I liked cooking, he took cooking classes. As soon as I gave it up, he moved on too. I told him one day: "I have a lot of hobbies, but your hobby is being better than me."	I helped a friend who was struggling financially get a job. For three months I made sure his schedule was cushy so he could both spend time on his school work and see his family often. We had a 90 day hiring bonus that was offered to anyone who brought in a new employer and since I brought him on that made me eligible for the bonus (a very nice $500). I never told him about the bonus, because I honestly didn't want the situation to get awkward or him ask me to split it with him. So, coincidentally he quit exactly a week after the 90 days, forcing the HR department to give me the bonus and make me look like I purposefully worked their system to receive it. He's damaged my credibility at work after all I did for him, the asshole.	1
Are laws banning holocaust denial as much of an imposition on free speech as proposed laws banning blasphemy of the prophet Mohammed?	You know, back when this whole Mohammed cartoon controversy started (2005?), when that Dutch newspaper printed 30 or so cartoons depicting Mohammed, Ahmadenijad announced that Iran would hold a contest for the best cartoons denying the Holocaust. At the time, no newspaper printed the Mohammed cartoons, but you could find them with google. So I was looking forward to seeing the cartoons from Iran to compare the two sets. However, when the Iranian contest ended, I couldn't find the cartoons anywhere. Nobody had threatened to murder anyone, yet nobody printed them. The only cartoon I did see was the winner, and it didn't deny the Holocaust so much as it implied that the Israeli army used the Holocaust to justify human rights violations. I'm still really curious what the other cartoons depicted.	No. The holocaust is a heavily documented event with a massive amount of physical evidence corroborating it as well as living survivor testimony, where as Muhammad was a scheming tribal warlord who made up communication with god to support his agenda as was convenient. Now it could be argued that holocaust denial should be covered under free speech in whatever country it is not, but that's not what you asked.	1
Chefs and waiters of Reddit, what type of dish do you always avoid when eating at another restaurant and why?	Anything you order after 30 minutes before the kitchen closes, just know I’d be doing the Eggplant emoji right now to signify some sort of bodily fluid	I avoid something that I think the kitchen doesn't experience much. If it's a steakhouse, I don't order the pasta. If it's a burger joint, I'll probably order a burger, not a chicken wrap. Don't send the kitchen into a frenzy because they can't remember how to prepare your food. And order something they're good at making. Don't go for half-assed. You're paying for this. Get something that will be good.	0
Hey Reddit, what can you say that would make me think about it for hours?	Do you have morals because you genuinely believe them or is it because society trained you to have them. Best not to think about it too much though, or you'll go crazy like me and become a high functioning sociopath	Your brain isn't always paying attention to what you're seeing or hearing, mostly because noticing everything all the time is impossible. Sometimes it fills in the blanks with whatever seems like a reasonable addition to the scenario. Because of this, you've likely experienced a small visual or auditory hallucination without ever realising that what you saw or heard wasn't real.	0
What movie did you think was a masterpiece the first time you watched it, only to think it was crap on the second viewing?	I'll probably get downvoted to hell for once liking this but the Twilight Saga. I read all the books, watched all the movies, still have a "Team Edward" shirt. I didn't think the writing was particularly great but the movies I loved. The movies now play on FX on repeat, so sometimes when there's nothing on I watch. Oh God, these movies are awful. The dialogue is so corny, so melodramatic. Kristen Stewart may be a fine actress in another movie but she can't be on screen for more than 5 minutes before twitching awkwardly and sighing. Don't get me started on the constipated Edward that Rob Pattinson portrays. I cringe when I realize how much of a fangirl I was.	Avatar. When I saw it on my own TV, and not on the big screen in 3D, I could not understand why I had like it so much.	0
Reddit, is there a time where a 'gut feeling' saved you from danger? If so, what happened?	Was very ill, woke up to vomit and made it to the sink. Thought about rinsing it and go back to bed, but felt like I should turn the light on. Did, and it was full of blood. If I'd gone back to bed I would've bled to death in my sleep. I got a fun ride to the hospital at 2am. Luckily that bleed finally got me onto the transplant list. And 2 years later I got my nice pre owned piece of liver. September 30th will be my 8th liverversary! Yay!	Yesterday, actually. I was slowing down to make a U-Turn on a highway. While slowing down, I noticed a large truck (maybe a dump truck) approaching me at a high rate of speed and not slowing down. Partially in the turn on a wet road, I floored it. I was able to make the turn just in time as the truck passed. Luckily my tire spin was minimal, and that allowed me to get out of the way in in time. Dodge Charger FTW.	1
Your workplace is a video game, your actual job is the "Main Quest" what are some of your obscure "side quests"?	SIDEQUESTS **Where is the Dongle?** You were the last ~~sean~~ seen with the dongle for the 15000€ software. Even though you know you gave it back, you have to find it. Run through all rooms and look at all PCs till you find it laying around somewhere. Optional: Find out who used it last and strangle him. ++++++++++++++++++++ COMPLETED QUESTS **Where is the Dongle?** **Where is the Dongle?** **Where is the Dongle?**	Main quest: military medical secretary. Side quests: - determine who is acting NCOIC this week - supplies order? Not my responsibility, talk to xxx (who just told you to talk to this person) ---- subquest to the side quest, beg neighboring clinic for that printer paper, Lysol spray, and caviwipes you need since all people who are supposed to be ordering it are either gone or passing the buck - track down the correct phone number for this consult you got because SPC Snuffy hasn't updated DEERS in three duty stations.	1
What is so good the first time, that every time after gets worse?	Flying on an airplane. The first time you do it, it's an experience, and you are apprehensive and excited. After 20 flights or so, you begin to feel like sophisticated cattle.	Pushing /r/thebutton. It was cool at first, when people were clicking, now it's been a month, Jesus Christ, let it go.	1
Teachers of Reddit, have you ever seen a student come back after a break(ie. spring break, Christmas break), completely different? What were they like?	Had a 1st grader whose brother had died. She had been an outgoing, bubbly kid. Came back a sobbing mess-she would literally lay on my lap and just sob.	Not a teacher, and it wasn’t mentally different. I was the student. To make a very long story short, I got facial reconstructive surgery and a chin implant over winter break. I had at least 2 teachers who didn’t recognize me at first. It was weird, I don’t think I looked that different?	1
Reddit, what is the worst secret your SO is keeping from you, but that you actually know?	After we found out he was diagnosed with lung cancer he began disappearing for long periods of time and making excuses about how he was going for walks or even smoking Marijuana. He was supposedly getting the money to pay for his cancer treatment from two old friends. After I found out he had a second cell phone and he refused to take the money from his friends I knew something was up. I now know he has been cooking crystal meth to pay for his treatment.	The first time my SO and I slept together I woke up during the night to use the bathroom. I came back in the room and she farted one of the loudest farts I've ever heard. I started laughing like crazy and she almost woke up. Almost. We've been together for seven years.	0
What is hands down, the absolute worst advice someone has giving you?	"You knocked her up, do the right thing, marry her." a) ginger b) alcoholic c) succubus Gonna fake my own death and disappear into the Olympic National Forest...	When I first got my drivers license my grandma told me driving is like playing dodgeball, hit them before they hit you.	0
What's the funniest/most cruel prank you've seen students play on a teacher?	One of my high school teachers always checked under her car for an assailant whenever she had to go somewhere, especially in the evening. One kid got it in his head to stuff a scarecrow under her car and the next day she came back with a hilarious story about how she was shouting at it to get out from under her car for like 30 mins before she realized that it wasn't a real person.	Well this prank was not really on one teacher but on a couple pupils parents and most likely also a couple teachers.. There is a parents-talk-to-teachers day (or whatever it is called) twice a year in our school and they ask pupils to bring cake or cookies every time. One time me and two of my friends decided to bring something aswell so we looked for some ingrediens in my friends kitchen. We ended up bringing shortbread biscuits covered with melted chocolate in which we hid crunched cat-food and chilli. People had to pay for these.	1
[Serious] What is the creepiest confession / most disturbing that you have heard from an otherwise normal person?	I used to help out at a nursing home. This old Russian lady would relate the same tale over and over. Her husband drank and hit her. It was sad for sure. But one day she leaned over and whispered "he was asshole drunk, so I pushed him down stairs. Dead."	When I was 18, I worked in the juniors section at Kohl's. This tiny old man came up to me and said softly, "Please don't freak out, but I need a dress. For myself." I replied, "Well, you don't really have anything here" -gesturing to my boobs- "so we'll have to find something that doesn't rely on that to look cute." I found him a few dresses. He tried them on in the dressing room. (I insisted he use the gender appropriate dressing room for the sake of any junior that might see him.) He thanked me for my professionalism and left. Then, I went home and completely freaked out because I am good during the stressful situation and then panic when it is over.	1
Today I was stuck in an elevator for 20 mins. The woman I was in the elevator with started screaming loudly and holding onto the walls. What is the biggest over reaction you have ever seen?	One of the coffee shops I worked in was in a really nice part of town and we rarely had problem customers. This one night though, I was closing up by myself and this guy comes in like 10 minutes after we closed. I had forgotten to lock the doors so I just informed him that we were closed and his face changed from calm to a look that implied he wanted me dead. I said we were closed again and his response was, "Oh yeah, I take the cookie". Then, he just took a cookie, shoved the whole thing in his mouth and angrily walked out of the door. I don't know if this would have gone different if we were opened honestly.	A bunch of Saudis blew up the World Trade Center and crashed into the Pentagon and George Bush was so mad at brown people that he invaded Iraq and killed a few hundred thousand innocent people.	1
What are you naturally good at?	All things sport. I'm just one of them people that can pick up any sport and be good at it in a short amount of time e.g. anything from tennis, golf, football (soccer for you heathens), to karting, snooker + pool I guess it's down to having good hand-eye/foot coordination or something, I can't explain it	Building myself up for something getting super excited and then discovering one fatal flaw in my plan completely and utterly fucks me over.	0
What is the worst example of spoiled behavior you have seen?	Any time a woman attacks a man because she knows he can't hit back. I've seen it too many times over the past few years with headlocks and bitchslaps aplenty edit: spelling	When I was a teacher (I have a few stories, but this is my favourite), I was teaching a class of kids from about 8-10. At my school, we gave out star stickers at the end of class to kids who did their homework, behaved in class, etc, and the kids absolutely loved it. Withholding a star was very serious business and the mere threat usually got a kid to settle down. So this one girl, usually pretty well-behaved, was acting up in class, and I told her that if she did whatever she was doing again, she wouldn't get her star for the day. She promptly did it again, so I didn't give her the star (first time ever). The next week, she had been pulled out of the school because I was "mean" for not giving her a star one time. Um, what?	0
What celebrity did you used to really like, but don't anymore?	Obama. Sad but true. We expected so much, he under achieved. He let the banks fuck us over and reversed the bill that stopped congresses insider trading. A review of his presidency proves to me that greed won out in the end.	JLo She came to film a movie at my uncles bar. She treated everyone horribly and complained about the town so much that the people demanded that the district remove her. Good thing she’s got her looks because she’s an ugly bitch on the inside.	0
People who act less intelligent than you really are, why?	Built this dumb persona up for my self took sometime but when I say something smart people compliment me and tell me what's wrong with me saying smart things	Life is easier if people think you're stupid. No one expects as much. At my last 2 jobs I didn't play dumb, I was overworked, everything was pawned off on me constantly. This job I play dumb, I get to do just my job and nothing else. I go home with no stress.	0
My manager just called from his boat and asked us to provide reasons why we wouldn't be at work this weekend. Reddit, what incredibly out of touch thing have you seen a boss do?	Had a boss who liked to work early, so he routinely called 6.30am meetings, often sending out the notice at 11pm the night before, even though our contracts clearly stated work was to start at 9am (we could get in earlier if we wanted to, but they could not require us to).	My boss misspelled my first name to a vendor who was setting up an account for me. When I advised my boss that the certificate the vendor issued didn't work on their site because my name was not *"misspelledname"* I was met with an "Oh that's not how you spell it?"	1
What happened at the worst party you've ever been to?	I wasnt at the party to begin with but i got a call from a clearly drunk friend saying that he needed help. So i drove to the house that the party was happening in and my friend walks out holding up another one of my friends, a girl, who was completely passed out. As i was asking him what had happened he told me that he had dragged her out of a bedroom from a guy that was trying to take off her clothes. That made me very angry and i walked into the house found the dude in the kitchen and i sucker punched him so hard that he just collapsed onto the floor. I then calmly walked out of the house and drove my friends home.	I went to a friend's graduation party after high school. I wasn't great friends with him, but I figured I would stop by with my gf because he was nice enough to invite me. The party was so done up, tables full of food, streamers, confetti, all that shit. And my gf and I were *the only ones there*. I felt awful. His parents clearly went all out to celebrate it, and it was so uncomfortable being one of 5 people there (including him and his parents). I felt awful for him. We stayed for hours out of pity, and just kind of made small talk. Super depressing :/	0
Women of Reddit: What was your favorite "drunk girl in a bar bathroom" encounter ever?	A Man of Reddit here with a drunk girl in a bar (well, indoor concert venue) bathroom encounter: I was standing at the ice filled trough at a country music concert that was a benefit to bring back the Huntsville Prison Rodeo of all things.... When I look to my right there's a rather attractive drunk girl peeing into the trough standing up. Her jeans were around her ankles and she was "aiming" using her fingers to pull, well up I guess? I stepped back to enjoy the show and her drunk girl friend took my place. A cop immediately walked in that saw them go into the mens room. He also enjoyed the show, then as they finished up simply said "Don't do that again" and let them go on their way. Tl;Dr: Chicks can piss standing up after all. Stop complaining.	I was out on one of my first nights in Europe and chillin in the restroom, waiting for one of my friends to wash her hands( there was a line). I was talking to my friend and my accent was different than everyone elses, so it got some people's attention. I heard a quiet "foreigner!" And then a random super drunk British girl came up to me, grabbed me by the face, and whispered " you are the brightest jewel of all", gave me a kiss on the forehead, and then yelled " never forget!" as her friends pulled her out of the bathroom. Ever since then I like to yell " never forget!" as I'm leaving a room.	0
Reddit, I leave for University in three days. If you could go back to your Freshman year and tell yourself one piece of advice, what would it be?	If a young man offers to take you out and he pays for your food and treats you nicely, it's common courtesy to at least suck his dick. He didn't invite you to eat out of the kindness of his heart. The social contract dictates that he expect something in return. In college, it is customary to pay him back in oral sex. Refusing will pretty much make you a pariah if he decides to tell your friends and family.	Go to class, but above all *listen* in class, I know countless people who turn up to class because it makes them feel better but don't listen anyway. Learning the material the first time around makes the weeks leading up to exams much less stressful.	0
What's something a friend has said to you that changed the way you look at them?	I have a friend who some how never seems down or sad, so I always thought he was just a happy kind of guy. But one day I was bitching about some stupid shit that happened at work, it was over some small exchange that didn't really matter in the long run, but I was letting it get to me hours later. After ten-fifteen minutes of me venting and saying today was a shitty day, he simply asked me, "are you having a bad day, or did you have a bad five minutes and you're letting ruin your whole day?" Made me realize it's up to me to have a good day, and that he goes through day to day shit too, but knows how to handle it. It made me realize that he wasn't just a happy kind of guy; he was a wise person.	"I'm voting for Trump." Edit: Just to elaborate, I do not think less of those of vote against who I am voting for. I think less of those who think Trump, in particular, would make a decent leader. This man is proven over and over again how he is not fit to unite a nation.	1
What is something you came across on the internet and have never been able to find again?	My work buddies and I came across a series of screenshots of a text message conversation once that I would absolutely love to find again. It was basically between a guy and girl and the guy was essentially just trying to break things off. The girl then said something along "oh too bad I just got you those new nikes you wanted". The dude then tries to play it off as his buddy was using his phone and asks if she really did get those to which she essentially replies "Nah fuck you". I've tried to find it a few times and have had no luck.	An extremely long and convoluted guide on how to get from a certain spot in some early MMO, to another spot (I assume you were not meant to be able to access the area normally or something like that) in the game. From memory it was EXTRMELY long, with screenshots, and even as a teenage gamer I had no idea what the game was or why anyone would bother with such a long guide. No idea on the game, possibly UO. The webpage was geocities level visually too. Always wanted to know what the game was...	0
What is your best ever purchase under $50?	Yesterday I spent $3 and had my donation read out by a robot on stream to over twelve thousand people. Both the message and the name were spoilers for the new Star Wars movie.	Once I saw a panhandler with a sign that read, "Jokes $1." So I gave him a dollar, and he gave me this little gem: "Why are there no Walmarts in Iraq? Because they're all Targets!"	0
What's normal for you but strange for everyone else?	making a shot and pool and then saying 'damn it' in frustration because I didn't have as much control of the cue ball as I wanted.	Picking my nose. It's normal if I do it, but it would be quite strange if someone else tried picking my nose.	0
Mods of Reddit, what's the most fucked up post you had to remove?	/r/HillaryClinton mod here. Constant trolling from Both sides. Get called a shill and told to fuck off several times a day. Their tears are delicious.	On r/TheWalkingDead someone posted that if "Blah Blah Blah" happens then he'll cut of his dick. Well "Blah Blah Blah" did happen so he posted a gif of I HOPE someone else chopping their dick off.	0
What do most people find sexy but is a turn off for you?	Being serenaded. I was kicking it with a guy who was convinced he could be on American Idol (his words). We were watching a movie at his place and he looks into my eyes and starts singing a Boyz 2 Men song. I didn't know where to look. It was so uncomfortable. I now know that I never want to be sang to ever again.	What is a turn off: -The whole "daddy" thing is weird. You want me to act like a child, call you daddy and not think its borderline pedo? - Men wearing make-up. (i.e Johnny Depp, Justin Bieber, Adam Lambert) - High heels. Would not be caught dead in them. I'm a sneakers, tshirt, sports bra kind of girl. Life is too rough for all that sissy stuff - Feminine Men. I guess women would say these are the types that are in touch with their feminine side. It is NOT a turn on. I like big & tall roughnecks.	1
How did you come up with your online alias or nickname?	Years ago I saw a user called /u/The_Penguin_In_A_Zoo and thought that it would be fun if I became his evil counterpart	I woke up with the lyrics to a hip-hop vampire musical in my head: How does a bat-faced undead son of a whore and a vampire Dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot in North America By providence the pride of Transylvania Grow up to suck the blood of Pennsylvanians	1
Black Friday insiders of Reddit, which deals should we stay away from?	Just stay away on black friday, stop supporting the ever growing window of shopping that takes workers away from their family earlier and earlier	The TVs are usually bare bones models of the real thing. Like lacking a lot of options/features. Look up the model numbers. They make a lot of them just for Black Friday.	0
What is the most trouble i can get in for $5 without hurting anyone?	I have done this prank before: Put on suit, fill a briefcase with bouncy balls, go to a business district and 'accidentally' have the briefcase fall open, proceed to frantically run around screaming "MY PRESENTATION!" and attempt to gather the bouncy balls. Be very gracious to anyone who tries to help.	Break five dollar bill into singles Go to shitty titty bar Throw a dollar bill at shitty stripper When she comes over, touch her v You'll get into a LOT of trouble And haven't hurt anyone Note: strippers aren't people	1
If you could genetically modify your child before they're born, would you do it?	No. 1. only people with money could to it, so the cap between rich and poor would grow drastically. there would be like one superiour group of people and one inferiour. that is ethically so wrong that I don't think I have to explain how our world would look like and what consequences this would have. 2. Life is a miracle wheater your a scienstist, spiritual, relgious or an internet user. You don't mess with that! edit: grammar etc.	Yes. Give it the advantages I always wanted in life, or remove the drawbacks I had? You better believe I'd do it.	0
What’s the worst meal you’ve ever been served in someone’s home?	So my father had a special medical condition where he had to get more protein than average, so he ate a lot of meat. If a meal didn't have protein, he wouldn't be able to digest it properly. We get invited to someone's house, he explains repeatedly about the condition, we get there and they say "here's this vegan meal." We didn't stay Edit: these people literally decided to be vegan that morning but didn't know how to eat vegan. The food they served had some protein, but not enough for my dad's medical condition	My Grandma had signature dishes, which meant it was all she made, ever. "Swiss steak" consisted of the cheapest cut of meat, cooked until hard and gray and then she'd dump a can of mushrooms on top and burn those until they turned into a congealed topping. Ramen noodles were usually cooked just to the point of liquidity, if she was feeling fancy she'd dump in a can of tuna and mix that all together with the seasoning packets. "Fruit salad" was orange or lime Jell-O mixed with canned fruit. The topping would consist of mayonnaise and cream cheese spread over the top. She also served reheated McDonalds french fries and used expired condiments and seasonings, she also washed her dishes with Ajax or Comet.	0
Teachers and students of Reddit, what is the most ingenious method of cheating you have witnessed?	I knew an Arab girl who would write chem notes and formulas all around her hands and wrists in Arabic so it looked like henna designs. Never been so jealous in my life	This is secondhand, but a friend had a student who signaled the answers to a multiple-choice exam by eating m&ms of various colors. The person was caught, presumably because he or she was holding up each m&m like an idiot before eating.	1
When browsing comments, I sometimes upvote people who have been downvoted when they don't deserve it. I always hope that OP sees it and that little bit of, "ugh a downvote" feeling goes away. What small things do you do to try and make other people feel better on reddit or in life?	I upvote most every reply to my comments. Firstly because I'm just happy someone thought enough about my comment to take the time to respond. Secondly because when someone is being a dick I can take away two points (the one free upvote and the downvote.)	I help out people on their way to oblivion. For example, when they say, "I know this will be downvoted to oblivion but..."	1
Aggravated grudge-holders of Reddit, what businesses are on your "No, fuck those guys" list?	Activision. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was one of my favorite games of all time and I was super pumped to hear that it was coming bundled with the newest game this year. However, it only comes with the deluxe version, which is $110 fucking dollars. Fuck those guys.	There is a 'wheelchair accessible' pub reasonably close to my flat. I even called ahead to say 'my SO is in a manual chair, and I am not strong enough to lift/manuever him over anything more than a small bump. Are we going to be able to eat/drink inside?' They assured me I would have no trouble, and even offered to reserve us a table. I declined, since I was relatively new to the technicalities of his chair, and didn't want to be late for a reservation. Come to arrive, and the front door has steps. Ok. Fine. My SO says he'll wait while I figure out how to get in. I ask. 'Oh. Well, we have outdoor seating accessible around the side, if he can go over a couple of potholes. But it's not accessible inside'. Like, really? I even called ahead.	0
Hotel workers, what is the worst thing you have ever had to clean up in a room?	A cop murdered a guest in the hallway. After the guest went to pull his pants up because thay had started to come down as he crawled terrified to the cop.	Guy had an stomach ulcer that burst while he was on toilet. Imagine a normal hotel bathroom in size, the entire floor and about a foot up each wall was covered in blood. I was DM and had to clean it as we couldn't ask the night porter to do it, he was squeamish around blood. Threw everything I used to clean it in the bin afterwards. The best part was this congealed lump of blood that would have been between his feet. I did have fun though, called the porter to stick his head around the corner, held up something and said "look stomach lining". First time I saw a person go green in the face in person.	0
Electric car owners: how do you rate your vehicle?	I really frustrated that mileage on US model cars is so low. Top Gear did a bit testing mileage and the diesel Jaguar XJ (the same on the Queen drives) got better mileage than a Prius, and you know fuel efficiency really wasn't the top priority for the engineers at Jaguar. Fuel-efficient diesels in Europe get more like 75-80MPG. Unlike most hybrids, they are cheap and reliable.	Another question I'd like to add: Those who have made the switch from gas powered cars to electric powered cars (including cars powered by both); do you think your decision was a good one (based on factors such as gas mileage, repair costs, reliability etc), do you prefer driving one or the other? would you rather stay with an electric car or go back to driving a gas powered car?	0
Psychologists of Reddit, what is normal to feel but yet many of us think only we and a few feel?	Competence It seems like everyone suffers from Impostor Syndrome but in reality a lot of people are good at their jobs and know it.	When you try to remember how many windows your apartment/house has it takes you the same time as if you physically walk through it	1
People who dislike sports: why?	I never had fun doing sports myself, so I never got the hang on watching them on tv. For me it´s just a bunch of people chasing a ball up an down a meadow, or throwing a ball up and down a meadow or whatever they do with their balls.	QUALIFIER; I no longer enjoy watching professional sports. Why? I did a degree in Human Kinetics and did courses in Philosophy of Sport, Sociology of Sport and Psychology of Sport all three together juat make professional sports atrocious really, bringing out the worst in humanity. Basically we've prettied up Roman Gladiators and call ourselves sophisticated. ALSO many professional sports have underlying sexism and racism and discriminate against at least one socioeconomic class. Its just annoying. We pour tons of money down the drains on HUGE arenas and economists agree they bring actually little economic return to their host cities. I could keep going but I stop here.	1
What's supposedly unattractive that you actually find attractive?	Pale skin and/or freckles. Some people are all about the tan, which is fine, but fluorescent-white skin is eye-catching to me. :D	When women don't have makeup on! I think women are so much more attractive when I can actually see their face. The natural blemishes are what make everyone different, and I love it.	1
What’s the most interesting documentary you’ve ever watched?	I love the Up Series, which follows a group of British children from age 7 into adulthood, putting out updates every 7 years. 63 Up is the next installment, due in 2019. I sincerely hope they’ll keep going when Michael Apted is no longer able to helm the project. It’s groundbreaking in the documentary form, and just fascinating to see some of the ways class, sex, personality and circumstances shape our lives. Also, HELVETICA is truly great.	The red pill (2016) by Carrie Jay. It's the true story about a feminist (Carrie Jay in fact) who try to find the other side of the argument and go seek and interview people from the MRA, the Men's Right Activist, and find the aren't the monster the feminist press try to force on them and just want to show the equality women don't want and try to change all the things in the system that go against men like the work injuries or guard of a child in a couple. It's a really great documentary and can change mind if people takes the time to watch it and it's also great to lose all your friend when you explain to them the movie and just shut you with "Yeah but women make less than men so you're wrong" 10/10 would watch again	1
People of reddit, what's your "I survived" moment?	I got to work before anyone else was there. I started eating a corn muffin and a huge chunk got caught in my throat. I couldn’t breathe and was choking to death. I finally dislodged it by ramming my body against a chest height counter over and over again until it popped out.	I was riding a bicycle on a road down a hill, having a grand old time, when I come upon a fairly sharp turn that is covered in gravel. I break to try and slow down enough to make that turn, but it's not nearly enough, as I reach the gravel, I feel the bike slide from under me and I'm due for a fairly brutal landing, because I'm going fast. Instinctively, I jump off the bike, holding on to the handle bars, and find myself standing, bike in hand on the gravel, slide another 3-4 feet, and come to a stop, completely unharmed.	1
I heard all of the horror stories about the TSA but always thought it really couldn't be that bad. Now I just moved to the U.S from Ireland and the TSA has stolen thousands of dollars of camera equipment from me. Is there anything I can do to get it back?	My brother travels a lot and told me it's the baggage handlers that steal his stuff. He wasn't sure at first but after a few incidents and checking his bags more often, that's his conclusion. They stole jewelry, watches and even clothes from him. Putting valuable stuff in the carry on is still the best option to avoid this, sadly.	So why the hell are you in Texas of all places? You come from a beautiful place, and you pick the most redneck, fucked up state that exists? Wtf?	1
Parents of Reddit, what "secret" do you know about your kids that they don't know that you know?	I know my daughter’s father isn’t her real father. He’s sterile, by choice. We were heavily involved in the lifestyle, and for my birthday seven years ago he set up a party with a bunch of strangers he found off Craigslist. Neither one of us knows who the father was, as we didn’t have any contact information besides email addresses. I’ll tell her the full truth when she gets a little bit older. Maybe when she turns 11 or 12 or something.	My son is 4. He still thinks he is invisible when he covers himself with a blanket. Our whole family has made a pact to act like he is. Things should be interesting in a few years	0
[Serious]Reddit, how did someone show you so much kindness, you couldn't find the words to fully express your gratitude?	A couple years after graduating college I was in a dead end job that I hated. I realized that I really wanted to go into digital art, but I was in a lot of debt and I couldn't afford it. My gram called me and told me that she had some money saved up and that she wanted to give it to me so that I could go back to school and do what I wanted. It was $20,000. I think I just started crying on the phone. I did go back to school and I won an Emmy last year. She passed away two years ago. I wish she could have seen it.	I used to work at a convenience store. One night I was sweeping the parking lot and, since I was out, I asked a guy in a car if I could bum a cigarette. He said, "Here, take these." And tossed me a brand new unopened pack! I was so thankful I wanted to kiss him.	1
What's the most pathetic way you've ended up in the Emergency Room?	Standing with a cup in my hand, cup breaks off handle, handle enters hand. (Was less than 1cm from severing nerves in hand that would probably have caused permanent damage) Lesson learned: Don't buy cheap-ass cups!	After suctioning a plastic drinking glass to my face at age 10 or 11 for an extended period of time, I broke a perfect ring of the blood vessels around my mouth. The resulting rash looking bruise stumped doctors for hours as they tried to figure out what kind of mystery infection I had and why it was forming as a perfect circle around my mouth... All the while my mom was crying because she didn't know what was happening to me. Finally, I asked the doctor "could it maybe be cause I sucked a glass to my face for a while at dinner time?" Noone in the situation was amused. TL;DR - Sucked and sucked until my blood vessels exploded.	0
What is the worst thing you've ever seen happen at a wedding?	Having a very expensive reception. Wait until the marriage lasts 10 years then you have accomplished something. Anyone can have wedding. It is really nothing but a big party to celebrate that you met someone. Love needs the test of time or it is all fake.	Divorced father of the groom started up about how much better his new wife was compared to his old wife, during his speech. On and on and the qualities of Asian women vs white women. I've never looked at my shoes so hard in my life.	0
Redditors who have objected at weddings or seen someone object, what happened in the next 5 minutes?	You won't believe it but the groom's fiancè claimed that she was part of some space government and shot up the groom! He was cool. I'll miss him. There was a huge gunfight afterwards and we had to bail. Fucking crazy!	My dad marrying his third wife. My step brother and I were in the wedding party. He was about 6, I was 10. The preacher asks if anyone objects and my brother raises his hand so very politely. My dad asks why, and my step brother replies, "because I want you to promise to take me fishing whenever I want, first."	0
What's a good example of a really old technology we still use today?	Mirrors are pretty old, several thousand years BC. If that's not "technological" enough, magnetic compasses date back to the 1100s.	Turn tables. They were supposed to be replaced by cd's but they are still going strong. Most die hard music listeners still use turn tables in fact.	1
If your username would be your superhero alias, what powers would you have?	The general populace pities me for my appearance, respects me for my former presidency and hates me for my shoveling puns. The criminals think I'm a joke. That's a *grave* mistake. Shovel to the face, baby! Yeah! My nemesis is Dr. John Wilkes Bulldozer	I'd be like a werewolf, but have control over my actions and the ability to morph at any time. I'd also be accepted as alpha male amongst other wolves and canines, giving me power to command hordes.	1
What "old person" name should make a comeback? What "old person" name has come back, but shouldn't have?	Augustus. Augie is a fine nickname, and Augustus is just boss. I have ancestors (both male) named Ninian and Confederacy. Those should never, never return.	I love how all these comments are off eurocentric/white names. Anyone here - have names from different countries - like for me as an Indian it would be Basanti.	1
[Serious] Redditors who have died temporarily and came back to life, what did you see?	No one in this thread has ever "died". They brains continued function the entire time. Any "supernatural" visions or distortions anyone claims to have experienced are easily explained by lack of oxygen being fed to the brain.	When I was dead, it was black. I didn't hear, see, or smell anything. It might be because I was only dead for such a short time. When they restarted my heart, I felt a pull on the center of my chest and it was like I was literally ripped out of the dark.	0
Dear Reddit, if there is one thing you regret not doing in your twenties, what is it?	Back when I was in my twennies had a problem making 160 so I moved up, had a probem making 168 but took the fight I shoulden have. I want the rematch, ROY JONES!	Right now, the top two comments are 'travelling more when I didn't have so many bills' and 'putting more money aside in savings'. So, basically you're going to regret one or the other. Don't worry about regret, just open yourself up to being satisfied with whatever choices you make.	0
What was the internet like in 1998, 2008 and 2018?	In 1998 it was a few odd sites by nerds and people jumping on the novelty of it all. In 2008..... SO much misinformation and trolling. Cyber bullying was a celebrated art in many circles and the entire internet was starting to resemble 4chan. Meme culture was on the rise. 2018... memes everywhere, sites now have reputations for being good or bad, WAY less pop up ads than the last two decades due to consumer complaints.	1998 hey cool I got email 2008 oh fuck more emails 2018 are my emails being watched and used for advertising purposes	0
I'm pretty sure my neighborhood is about to get robbed in the next week. What should I do?	My house got burgled just this month. I bought a $600 Revo 8-channel home surveillance kit with a 160 Gig DVR. Wired it up and caught a kid casing the house. Printed his pic, put it up on fliers. Haven't seen him since.	>I already called the cops So let them handle it. Otherwise, be smart and leave lights on, or buy timers that will turn lights on/off, have someone else pick up mail, etc.	1
What video game has brought you to tears?	First of all, **MAKE SURE YOU PUT SPOILER ALERT BEFORE SPOILERS PEOPLE JESUS FUCKIN CHRIST** Second, the first time I ever cried was a few months ago, when I beat the first video game I ever owned: Zelda Oracle of Ages. I had had it since I was 6 years old, and I never got past the second dungeon because, well, I was 6 years old. Awhile back I saw it on the 3DS eShop, so I obviously bought it and beat it. The feeling of completion coupled with the nostalgia was enough to bring a tear to the eye. I fucking love Zelda, man.	Most of the Kingdom Hearts games, save for CoM, which I just can't get the hang of. Xion and Roxas' subplot is particularly sad.	0
Does Anyone Sell or Know How To Create The Smell of the Disneyland Pirates of the Caribbean Ride?	Stand in a line for an hour then piss yourself. The smell on that ride is of disappointment and being overrated.	I go to Disneyland every year to visit my american side of the family and never really thought about the smell until now. ...It is a good smell. Like L'odore de Pirates. I'd buy that cologne.	0
What book has changed the way you see the world?	How To Win Friends and Influence People. It's also the best book with the worst name. As someone who is as profoundly socially inept as I am, this changed how I treat people. Tuning into people's emotions is very difficult for me, and it explained things very well. So, for example, rather than challenging people on details, I learned how some things are best left unchallenged for the sake of a person's integrity, ego, and emotions rather than the truth itself.	Das Kapital. Even if one cannot understand all the mathematical formulas in the tome, the mere complexity and bullshittery of the capitalist system appears in how illogically the ideas connect. The ideas that capitalism is based on is perhaps the most complex "bread and circuses" scheme in all of human history.	1
What's one moment in your life you wish you had recorded?	That time when I was a confused 13 year old who played drums horribly at a tavern. Oh wait, that is recorded.....	A couple year ago I leaving class with a few friends and jumped in an elevator. Just as the doors were closing I saw a few more friends hoping to catch us. I acted on instinct and threw the water bottle I was holding towards the door. It was a perfectly timed and perfectly aimed throw as the bottle got wedged between the doors and forced them open. I causally walked over, grabbed my bottle from the doors as they opened and let my friends in as if it was no big deal. I'd rewatch the shit out of that moment.	0
Straight people of Reddit, what questions do you have for LGBTQ people?	Whats LGBTQ? And before youre calling me "an ignorant piece of sh**" like people tend to do... please acknowledge im one of many who dont care if youre whatever except an unique individual like everyone else	I’ve always been curious about the gaydar. The consensus seems to be that all gay people can tell, but how accurate is it really?	0
Gay People Of Reddit: What are things that you don't have to explain to each other, since you're dating the same gender?	Lesbian here. My wife and I understand the subtleties of the patriarchy. It's nice to come home and tell my partner about something that was said or done on the job and not have to then explain the misogyny behind it and why it was offensive. The shared journey and validation helps us navigate this crazy planet. (Not saying that men can't understand it, but it's nice to be with someone who can truly empathize.)	Person A: Wanna have sex? Person B:Hmm, not right now. Person A: Okay, I'm gonna go jack off. Person B: Enjoy! No muss, no fuss.	0
Reddit, how did you get sent to the principal's office?	I threw one of those oversized suckers into a bear cage when we were on a field trip. The bear ate it, died because it was diabetic. Whole school applauded as i walked through the lunch room and straight to the principals office.	Eddie squirted ketchup on his hand, then slapped me. We both got in trouble for "fighting." Fuck you, Eddie, I didn't even do anything to you.	0
Homeowners/Renters, what's the strangest discovery you've made in your residence?	I moved into a flat along a quiet road of really old buildings. One day when i was in the kitchen i stepped on something loose that seemed a bit bigger than a floorboard. Being the nosy bastard i am, i pulled up the linoleum and there was a hatch. I opened it and about a dozen stone steps led underground to this really long corridor with what looked like bricked up rooms. My landlord did some research and discovered that the flat was my towns first ever police station. Made sense really, because there were still bars on the kitchen windows. Me and my landlord really wanted to knock one of the walls in to see the cells behind but we didn't want to compromise the safety of the building. It's also how i got into urban exploration.	This would be a fun thread if the op was not constantly demanding PICS OR IT DIDN'T HAPPEN on every comment.	1
In TV and movies, who would be most likely to win a "father of the year" award?	Uncle Phil from Fresh Prince of Bel-air. He was awesome, he always kept his kids in line and was able to take all the fat jokes	Walter White. The lengths he went to to provide a secure future for those that came after him were extraordinary.	1
Teachers of Reddit, what is the most disrespectful thing a student has done or said?	When I was student teaching, a senior thought it would be funny to go rip the wig off of a teacher who was going through chemo at the time.	Was laughing with my friends at our lunch table in middle school. This rather large black woman who was the special ed teacher of some sort proceeded to come over and yell at us about how our grandparents were all racist and taught us to be racist as well. Fucking yelling in the middle of the lunch room was baffling for us little white kids haha	1
Employers/hiring managers/HR people of Reddit has anyone ever given you a reference that ended up costing them the job? If so what happened?	*I* was the reference that cost someone a job. This dumbass was my roommate's boyfriend. I hired him on at my shop because he needed some extra cash. He barely worked for the two months he worked for me. Like most of our lazy employees, we just phased him out rather than fire him. Anyway, he applied for a job in his field at a petroleum engineering company or something. It was a management position and he needed management experience. He put himself down as *my* supervisor. Well they called me because they wanted to know what it was like being managed by him. I thought it was a mix up and they said "no, he put himself down as the manager of the shop." Yeah, no. I told them that was a straight up lie. He didn't get the job.	I was hiring a receptionist. I called her reference she was an old manager. She just said your hiring her good look with her showing up and hung up.	1
My best friend is in a bind. I really want to help her like she has helped me in the past, but I have nothing to offer. What can reddit suggest?	I Wouldn't post this much detail to reddit, what if she's a redditor? Edit: on a serious note, that bus monitor got 700,000. I dont see why you couldn't do something like that for her?	As someone who works in a disability law firm, just tell her to keep applying everyone gets denied at first. The process does take an extremely long time though, if she really is in a dire situation (i.e. eviction) she can ask to have her case expedited	0
Have you experienced anesthesia awareness? What was it like?	My cousin had to have an emergency c section before any anesthesia set in. She said it felt like her bladder was being ripped out. Cute kid though.	I was having knee surgery. And apparently my eyes were taped shut but I saw the entire thing and heard everyone's conversations. I was asked about it later and the softer said that, and I quote, "so, you saw me pick my nose" to which I replied something along the lines of "what the actual fuck, no, fuckstick." And he said well I guess that checks out. And left.	1
What’s a common myth about your job that is completely false?	That men don't suffer sexual assault in the workplace. I was working hard yesterday and my boss decided to pull down my trousers and furiously beat me off sitting at my computer desk. Being self-employed aint as easy as you think.	Road construction workers stand around doing nothing all day. Wrong! Occasionally we find a tailgate to sit on while we wait for our turn to hold up a sign for a shift.	0
Have you ever read a story on Reddit and realized you know the person in real life? What happened?	Oh man the first one of these i get to answer and it's so lame. I sold a baby parrot I hand raised for work to a girl and later saw her post pictures of him in a parrot subreddit.	I read a series of comments and realized it was ME, from the future stealing all my karma before I could attain it.	1
I dug up a WWII dog tag. Can Reddit help me find the owner or next of kin so I can return it?	Has anyone considered he might just have a huge hard on for some chick named Opal Bjorklum, and is just using reddit to track her down? This is better than facebook!	I looked him up on Ancestry.com. He was a Sgt. Maj., and arrived in New York City on the ship Charles A Stafford on 24 Feb 1947. His next of kin there is Opal C Bjorklum, Manitow Springs, Colo. Alvin and Opal Bjorklum are also listed in a 1995-1996 telephone directory in Sun City West, AZ. This directory entry has address and phone number, but I won't post those here.	0
What was the dumbest assignment you were given in school?	That's super easy - reading Hamlet. I hadn't learned how to do taxes, perform an oil change, write a resume, cook a meal, understand nutritional macros, change a diaper, write a check, bench press a barbell, start an IRA and invest in securities, select a presidential candidate to vote on, or even solve for x in a simple algebraic equation. Somehow Hamlet was prioritized above all of that.	The teacher for my AP Government class used to make us grade the tests and papers from his other classes because "we were smart enough to learn the material on our own." We never really complained about it because grading tests is more fun than doing actual work. But in the end it kinda sucked cause most of us did bad on the AP exams...there are three branches of the government and by the time the AP exams rolled around, we had only gone over two in class.	0
I broke both of my arms on Sunday, now what do I do?	If you haven't already, go to a hospital. Your bones need to be set in line otherwise they are going to heal all wonky, and you'll have wonky arms for the rest of your life, or until you break them again. Tell a doctor what happened (no need to be embarrassed, doctors deal with this kind of thing all the time) and they will help you. Good luck!	I cant hold my 360 controller either :( Funny thing is first thing my uncle said when he walked into my room was " You could probably get a few sympathy handjobs out of this."	0
People who get up immediately when your alarm clock goes off. How do you do it?	Honestly I mentally have to kick myself in the ass everytime, when I get the thought of staying in bed I have to replace it with "don't be a pussy"	I had to decide I was going to wake up at that time. I had to want it, because I want to succeed, and because I know I can do it... as opposed to waiting for my alarm to force me out of bed like a parent. It's all about taking ownership, and realizing that there are millions of people working 10x harder than me on less sleep, for their entire lives, in situations way shittier than I can imagine.	1
What game do you know a lot about but never actually played it?	Rugby. It's nice to watch and I'm pretty familiar with the rules, but I'm way to small to actually play it.	I know a lot about monopoly. I'm the king of it. I don't play it much anymore these days. It's a great game.	1
What social experiment would you love to try but is impossible to conduct?	Take a bunch of children and raise them to believe they are living in the late 19th Century. All their caretakers would keep up this charade, and every detail and social event would be replicated. Then introduce them to modern society. Closest we could get to time traveling.	id like to see the results, but id never want to actually try it because its morally fucked. the experiments where you take newborns and put them in crazy environments, in order to try and ascertain what is nature vs. nurture could be used to study language, intelligence, social attitudes, anything	1
Divorce lawyers of Reddit, what things do clients always think is unique about their divorce, but is actually common?	ITT: men who should easily realize how horrible of a deal marriage is for men, but don't. Women strike gold in marriage. Men lose their life.	I often receive warnings from clients about how "clever" or "smart" their spouse is and to be careful as to not let them manipulate me. I don't want to be insulting so I just say something like "I am a professional, etc." In reality the other spouse has never been very clever at all. They just had power over my client that they've built through long term emotional and psychological abuse. The client is usually pretty delighted to finally see their abuser get ripped to shreds in court. (context: family lawyer working with domestic violence survivors)	0
People with a mother tongue that isn't English, what are the most annoying things about the English language when you are trying to learn it?	That most native speakers can't even speak their own language, yet I'm supposed to learn the proper grammar and I'm judged by my accent.	Pronunciation of words. Took me years of watching tv shows in English for it to sound natural. It just seems like there's no firm rules to follow. Edit: spelling	0
Reddit, what are your top "This wasn't in the job description" moments?	I work for a comic book/record store. On my first day, my boss told me there was a dead possum outside. I was handed a broom, a cardboard box, some packing tape and a plastic bag. I went outside and got it in my head that the possum might be *playing dead* and not actually dead at all. So I poked it a couple of times, pushed it into the plastic bag, put the plastic bag in a cardboard box, taped the box up and left it outside by the door. Someone later that day must've walked by and thought the box was a UPS delivery or something, cause they took it home. Fuckers. Enjoy your possum.	I work at a leasing office, and live on the property for the complex I work at. The other morning, at 6AM during FINALS WEEK, my manager starts blowing up my phone asking me to go walk to the other end of the property, and shut off some kid's fire alarm. I told her I would do it later, but it was about 50 degrees out, my hair was sopping wet, and I was naked. Not to mention I had been up all night studying. She kept calling me until about 7:30 and then she gave up. My job is simply to give tours and sign leases during the hours I am scheduled. Just because I live on the property does not make me their on-site 24hour matinence girl	1
Cult survivors of Reddit, what is your story?	I wish I knew his whole story, but I met a patient who was one of the few survivors of the Jonestown Massacre. He had gotten out a few days before the mass suicide, but sadly he was unable to get his wife and child out. You could tell (and I am sure it would be the same for anyone) that he had carried some serious guilt the rest of his life. Unfortunatley he passed recently.	I was mormon until I was 8 and then my parents decided being mormon was dumb so we stopped. I didn't give a fuck and was glad I could sleep in on Sunday. The end.	1
What is the boner policy with nudists?	Every time a nudist does an AMA it gets asked. And every time the nudist gives a bullshit answer (like: Oh, that doesn't happen here, nudists are more mature because we don't treat people as sex objects). This then starts a giant circlejerk of people stating the obvious: it's a biological response. Nothing gets answered and everyone's time is wasted.	Summertime nudist here. They're actually INCREDIBLY uncommon. Your body just knows that when you're naked in public it should stay flaccid. When it does happen you pretty much just sit down, lay down on your belly, or go for a swim until it goes away. Just don't walk around with it like you're proud and everything's gonna be cool.	1
Reddit, what does that one guy at work do that you cannot stand??	Guy I sit next to one day just takes his shoes and socks off, puts his crackled ass feet up on his desk and start lathering his feet in lotion. The sound of lotion going in between toes and what not gets me sick, but his grunting while he does it sends me over the edge....	got a co-worker that comes to work 10 minutes early so he can take a dump. I don't get it and don't wanna ask. But every single morning like clockwork he's in our only office bathroom taking a poo. I mean, we all know ever if he is there at 7:45 not to bother him or give him any work until 8:00am because he's occupied. He's got to know we all know. So he clearly has no shame.	1
Got my iPhone stolen by TSA and I tracked their home address. Does reddit have any ideas?	Where at in Alabama? I'm currently down here on business, and I also have a friend of mine who is currently a news anchor down here. I may be able to help you. PM me if interested.	Ok, as a sysadmin and part BOFH, I award you no sympathy points (for the pics- sorry about the phone, that's dick). If the pics on the phone were so priceless to you, why not just recover them from your backups? Oh, no backup of these **years** of priceless photos? C'mon... when will people realize that technology doesn't run on fairy dust and unicorn blood?	1
Which sport is your country most successful at?	Norway here, we are quite good at everything that involves skiing, also we have the most medals in the winter olympics. Proud of this small nation.	Basketball, baseball, bowling, golf, downhill skiing, swimming, snowboarding, figure skating, boxing, womens soccer, wrestling, skeet shooting, gymnastics, cycling, judo, rowing, tennis, volleyball, water polo, diving etc.	1
What's the strangest thing you've ever walked in on?	Walked into my dorm. One room mate was sitting doing homework at desk, and the other was having sex on her bed.	After a night of drinking and getting high at a friends house it was time to head home. It was just a cheap 2-bedroom ground floor place. I walk into the place and see my roommate standing/straddling over his ex after apparently punching her. The community bong was broke and the place was a mess. Looks like there was a huge fight. He looks at me and as if nothing was happening and asked if I wanted to get high. It was then I noticed that his 15 year old girlfriend was also there crying on the couch. I politely declined and decided to tell them to keep it down while I go pass out. The next morning he made me breakfast and got smoked me out. So many strange stories from that place.	1
What's the weirdest/most incredible thing you've seen when casually looking out the window?	A bear looking back in at me. I mean, "paws on either side of the window frame" looking in. He'd been doing it for a while, I think.	ghetto ass arguments. I live in a pretty wealthy area of chicago, but every so often I'll hear something like this: "Hey Chinaqua, I still love you" "Tyrone, then why did you fuck Veronica" "Cause her titties are big, but I LOOOVE YOU" "Oh Tyrone... no I can't take you back, FUCK YOU TYYYYROONNNE" "I Have weed" "Tyrone I love you!"	1
What fucked up thing did your school do?	My public grade school forced us each morning, while we children were sleepy-headed and especially brainwash vulnerable, to recite a propaganda script of nationalism pinned with religious righteousness.	Junior High: students were locked into the lunch area during lunch period to prevent students roaming the halls. I didn't realize how dangerous it was (e.g. in case of fire) until one day some kid poured superglue in one of the locks as a prank and everyone started to get claustrophobic and freak out.	0
You get two Midas Touches in the next 5 minutes. What do you turn to gold?	Myself. Let the history books be forever confused at where I went and why there was a gold statue of me.	I'd punch Donald Trump in the face. That way there will forever be a solid gold statue of Donald Trump midway through being punched in the face.	1
Driving instructors of Reddit, what did your worst student do?	My drivers ed instructor told me about 2 different people: The first asked what the big circle thing was. He assumed she meant the speedometer and other gauges, so he started to explain what they all meant, and she stopped him and said, “no, this!” And pointed at the steering wheel. The second student was super nervous and when merging onto the freeway, she fainted.	my driving instructor told me he once taught a girl who went the wrong way all the way around a roundabout... during her test. she just panicked, I guess!	1
Which book changed your life and when?	The Bible. Read it as a young teenager and have not stopped reading it since. Seriously, like no other book I've ever seen.	I read The Phantom Tollbooth in elementary school, and ten years later it still makes me consider how interesting words are. After reading that book I thought more seriously about how I spoke and how I wrote.	0
What small thing takes your anger from zero to 60 in one second flat?	Feminism Saw a post yesterday that said “What if men were as disgusted with rape as much as they are with periods” @feminists Im a man who is disgusted by rape and could give a shit if a girl is on here period. Still gonna smash. How could this help your cause? You lose the support of all the men who feel the same way. Makes you more of an asshole than a feminist	People who don't understand how right of way works while driving and then proceed to honk at me because they made an incorrect and unpredictable maneuver almost causing an accident	0
In the wake of Fyre Festival, what is your own terribly planned event horror story?	I found this leather bound "pitch book" in a motel dresser talking mad hype about this festival called "Heaven"... See, these famous dudes got together and planned the "ultimate after-party-after-party," the main selling point being that not only would *everybody* that was anybody be going, but that it would last for *eternity*... Turns out they just made it all up, the ticket price can't ever be fully paid no matter how much you give and all the celebs are actually going to this *other* party (that was supposed to suck, probably a competing festival,) instead... I think it was in a volcano or caldera or something. Sounded hype. When asked to comment, promoters just said I didn't believe in it hard enough... No refunds.	In St. Augustine, Florida 2 years ago, there was a Bacon Festival where you could pay something like $12 or $15 at the gate to get in and eat all things bacon. Every vendor there was supposed to be feeding you something with bacon in it. Most things were supposed to be free after you paid your entry fee. It was supposed to be an all-day event. After 2 hours they ran out of bacon. They kept charging the entry fee and letting people in, though.	0
Happy Mother's Day! What did you get your mom?	... You actually saved my ass. My family and I are Lithuanian, and it's ACTUALLY Mother's Day today. Ran out to get some flowers. For this, I thank you.	you mother fucking idiot you dont put a fudking dumb asss fucking title like this unless you want to get your fucking dumb ass murdered who the fuck do you think you are you dumb son of a bitch faggot	1
Which movie had the best 'one liner' that people still say from time to time?	I know you can be overwhelmed and you can be underwhelmed...but can you ever just be whelmed? I think you can in Europe.	"I didn't want to say anything, but with those narrow hips that woman couldn't have more than six or seven children."	1
Anyone know someone who had a Russian mail order bride,how did it go?	I used to work with a woman who was a mail order bride from Siberia. She was really smart, good looking, and fun to work with. Her husband was a decade or so older than her, but they both really loved each other. I think when I met her they had been married about 5 years at that point. Back in Siberia, she was a high school physics teacher, but the economy there was such shit that she ended up not getting paid for several months and just quit showing up to teach. Here, she was a volunteer at a local high school even though she didn't have any kids of that age.	Met a guy that has a African bride. He's about 20yrs her senior and she's about as civilized as a stray dog.	1
What quote from a book that you've read has stuck with you?	There is probably no more terrible instance of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a man — with human flesh. from Collected Sayings of Muad’Dib by the Princess Irulan	And so God sent His one and only Son so that whoever believed in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. John 3 : 16	1
A friend of mine living on minimum wage recently waited in line for an iPhone 5, yet is so destitute that her 18-month old has been fed mostly Ramen and Cheetos for the past year. When have you seen young parenting go horribly, horribly wrong?	I go into the ER lobby and call in a 4 year old kid. Mom starts walking towards me, the boy is behing her crying his eyes out. It was not a painful cry or a scared kind of cry, it was a mad type of cry. As we were going into the office, I asked about that. Her reply was that, "he's just mad because he did not want to go to the hospital so I told him I was taking him to Chuck-E-Cheese."	Am am a long time pediatric ER nurse. I was assessing a baby that the mother brought in with a complaint of troube breathing. While I was checking him out, I caught a wiff of bug spray. I asked mom about it. She told me that she saw a bug crawl in his mouth so she gave it a squirt of Raid. I was dumbfounded. Speechless. I just looked at her with my WTF face. She told me not to worry, it was only a little bit. That woman was around 16. TLDR: Mom sprayed Raid into her baby's mouth.	0
Be honest, what's the most cringy thing you've done?	Tried to start a chain email when I was in 5th grade or so, emailed it to like 6 people, 5 never responded (and never forwarded it) 1 just replied "dude, no" I was thoroughly embarrassed, it's one of those things you think about randomly at night and hate yourself for.	I just killed a microwave because I made popcorn and didn't pay attention. It might not be salvageable(the microwave). Which has ruined things for the rest of my dorm mates...	1
People who stutter, do you prefer that we help you or should we wait for you to finish the words yourself?	I used to have a severe stutter. Sometimes I appreciated it when I just wanted to get my meaning across. Most times I just felt defeated, because someone finishing your word / sentence for you meant that I didnt manage to do it myself. I wasnt mad at you for interrupting me, you were just trying to help. I was mad at myself and my condition. Thing is, even if I did get the word / sentence out after a strong block, I felt defeated, because I didnt manage to speak fluently, and the intended effect of my speaking was completely butchered by my symptom. Personally, I didnt really care or mind either way. I just hated myself because my stutter prevented me from being me.	Let us finish our damn words. You're not helping. We know how to say the word it just takes some effort. Have some goddamn patience.	1
Reddit, I don't want an autistic boy with behavioral problems to be my ring bearer, and at the very least I want to warn my family that he'll be attending my wedding. Am I being a dick?	Fuck no your not being a dick. Its your wedding. You can do what you want. Keep the retard in his cage.	This same scenario happened at my sisters wedding, my brother in law has a cousin that's autistic (not as high functioning as your wife's nephew). What they ended up doing was give the rings to the best man to carry and just give the ring bearer the pillow to carry. He ended up walking down the aisle then went and sat with his parents for the ceremony. Besides a few vocal outbursts everything went fine. I think if you take the same approach and have him sit by his parents then there shouldn't be a problem.	0
What's the weirdest or dumbest thing you've done because you were horny?	On a bench on a public walk way in front of the beach at around 10pm, fingered a girl while she had her super long legs (she was like 6"2 in flats, I'm 5"10) spread wide. She's moaning like hell then another couple of course came around the corner and stood for 5 seconds watching before we realised.	Once I came home from school and I was super horny, I think no one is home I check the kitchen and I see an apple pie, I think to myself "why not" so I whip my dick out and start to fuck the apple pie and out of nowhere my dad walks in and finds me fucking this pie it was so terrible.	1
Reddit, what is your best badass/don't fuck with me moment?	this wasn't me, because i am not nearly badass enough to do anything like this. my friends dad is a truck driver, and he used to pick up hitchhikers ALL THE TIME. one time, he picked up two of them, and they started on the journey to wherever they were going. after an hour, one decides he's going to try and jack the truck, and pulls out a knife. well, my friends dad, being super badass, floors it, and says "you're going to put that knife away, or i'm going to kill us all" and steers directly towards the concrete dividers that were splitting the highway up ahead. the would be truck-jackers, put away the knife and sit quietly for the rest of the ride, and he STILL drops them off at their destination.	One time on WOW some guy tried to kill me so I killed him using my level 50 magic. I had to show my dominance.	1
I'm usually easy-going and quite shy, but yesterday for the first time I yelled in public at a bunch of complete strangers for their behaviour. Reddit, have you ever confronted total strangers about their actions and how did you do it?	I had just gotten off work and was sitting on the bus waiting for the bus driver. I work in a mall, so needless to say I was not in the mood to deal with people anymore. There was a group of teenage boys being loud and harassing other people on the bus. When they weren't getting a rise out of them, they turned to me and started catcalling me. One of the kids grabbed his junk and said "hey girl, I got something for you." I stared him right in the face and said "fuck off or I'll rip your balls off and shove them down your throat." He went completely pale and didn't say a word the rest of the bus ride. One of the most satisfying things I've ever said to anyone.	I saw people feeding fried chicken to a bunch of chickens at a medieval festival thingy. They were laughing and taking photos while everyone else stood around watching, completely grossed out. So I intercepted and got more than a bit arsey with them in front of this large crowd. Am so not the type.	1
Reddit, what's your best "I like my _____ how I like my ______..."?	I like my women like I like my whiskey. ten years old, full of Coke and locked in my basement.	"My dad works in on an airline, and one day, a flight attendant asked the pilots if they'd like any coffee between flights. They both said yes, and she asked how they took it. The captain replied "like my women," in an attempt at humor. The flight attendant, without missing a beat, answered 'no, sir, the coffee here is free!'" - /u/Enect	0
What parenting mindset is the absolute worst to go by?	As a teacher I am SICK of parents telling their kids "well in our house if someone hits you you hit them back." No. Do not tell your children that. In the real world that's called **assault** and you go to **jail** no matter who "started it."	"My kid's an extension of myself" Fortunately my parents made it very clear that I was expected to find my own identity in life, but some parents get *bizarrely* attached to the idea of their kid carrying torches for them.	0
A creepy customer used to come into my store and hit on me. Today he was arrested for the murder of a UNH student. Anyone else have a "bullet dodged" story?	I literally dodged a bullet. I was about 14 and sat in the tram. In our trams, on the right side there are double seats and on the left side there are single seats. I prefer sitting on the single ones, but the tram was full and I had to take a seat next to a scruffy, smelly man. Some stops later, people are leaving the tram and a spot on a single seat on the left opens. I want to sit there, but I figured it would be rude to the guy next to me to stand up and sit somewhere else. So I didn't. Minutes later, a bullet flies through the window at the exact place where my head would've been had I taken that single seat.	There was this guy I met at a card tournament where my bf at the time was playing. Later on this guy found me on Facebook. I just thought cool he wants to keep in touch. He started flirting. I alerted my SO, who got him to stop. I was 14 at this point in time, he was like 21 years old. I got in contact with my ex recently and he told me this guy was sentenced last year to ten years for rape and extortion of women. THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ME!!!!!!	1
Which inventor would be disappointed with how we decided to use their invention?	Richard Jordan Gatling, inventor of the gatling gun, intended it to reduce the size of armies and therefore dead and wounded, as well as to highlight the futility of war. It didn't work.	Albert einstein was pretty disappointed how E=MC^(2) was used on japan by the USA EDIT: The country, not its capital city	1
What are some interesting original theories/thoughts that you have?	I have the theory that a large percent of the posts in /r/askscience are of people writing science fiction novels that want to give their work some accurate science background. Also, a large percent of posts in /r/askhistorians are of people writing historical novels that want to give their work some valid historic background. I often imagine what those novels could be about, it's rather entertaining. EDIT: yes, I've heard about your theory that they are also students procrasti-researching their paper. That's the more obvious one.	The earth and human are older than people think. The Big Bang isn't the start of the Universe, but the height of humanity engaging in Nuclear war. A few survived and started from scratch and passed on the story and making a new beginning from the Big Bang... But the story got muddled Edit : Fictional thought, not factual one	1
What is your biggest "it's not what it looks like" moment?	Alright, so it was like a day or two after Halloween. So I bumped into a little girl when I was taking out the trash. I felt bad because i knocked her over, and trying to be nice offered her of the rest of the Trick or treater candy I had in my house... She said no thanks and then proceeded to RUN full speed to her apartment.... Then I realized I just became the creepy stranger with candy. Fml	In school a while ago, I was walking down the hall behind this hottie wearing white pants and you could totally see her black thong. Well, she turned around and I did the only sensible thing to cover my staring at her ass...I told her the time and walked off.	1
What are subtle red flags at a job interview that verbalize, "Working here would suck"?	Went on an interview and the hiring manager said the culture of the office was for everyone to try and arrive before your boss arrives, and leave after your boss leaves. He told me a story about how he arrived at 4am once and his boss was already there that day so he stayed even later that evening to “make up” for arriving “late”. Nope!	To every autistic person, everywhere sucks when you're looking for a job, because there's always a chance a manager will pay you a lower salary than everyone else. If you want a real job, go to those places where they only hire autistic people. Bing bang boom. You learn interviewing skills, but know you're going to get the job.	1
In all seriousness, what do you do when you feel helplessly lonely?	I'm a pretty spiritual person. Because of my relationship with Jesus Christ, I don't get the feeling of being helplessly lonely.	Usually I visit my parents. It's a good way to get grounded, plus I get to see the dog and the cat, which is good for my sanity.	0
What is a scene from a movie you watched as a kid, then saw later as an adult, only to realize you had completely misunderstood the scene?	Army of Darkness. I was terrified when I saw it as a kid. Then I got the satire and couldn't stop laughing. Edit: The mispelling.	In Back to the Future, I knew Biff was in the car with Marty's mom and I knew she didn't want him there. I knew he was trying to kiss her and she didn't want it. But I just kind of thought it was because she thought it was gross and wanted him to leave. It wasn't until I was older that I realized that Biff was about to rape her.	0
Teachers of Reddit, what's a situation that you thought was hilarious, but had to discourage?	I student taught at a catholic high school, and one day during a quiz I was browsing the school website for teachers that had the personal/ behavioural histories of each student. There was a full paragraph about an incident that involved one quiet but friendly enough 16 year old boy. In religion class they had been making rosary bead necklaces. He made his into a long rope shape instead of a necklace shape and was whipping it around at the other kids while laughing and saying they were anal beads. The old female religion teacher was VERY upset with this behaviour and described it in vivid detail. Apparently when she reprimanded him he responded by telling her that he was an atheist so the anal beads were fine. I laughed out loud, breaking the silence of the class.	A boy called a girl 'a retard' for pushing through the door before him. He denied it, I heard him say it. Took it to the teacher, then head and then the parents got involved. The school decided to back down, but I said to the kid 'You KNOW I heard you'. What a little twat.	1
Redditor's who were stuck in a pyramid schemes, how did you get in, what trapped you, and how did you get out?	I almost got trapped into a pyramid scheme when I was a bit younger. My boss did *It Works* and I needed extra money to buy a car. She jumped at the opportunity and hounded me about joining for months. She wouldn't stop calling me, texting me, messaging me on all social media. Regardless of how many times I told her no, she didn't quit. I've never experienced anything like that.	I went in to a mini pyramid. There were too many passages and when we emerged we came out to a different location. Interesting holiday.	1
If you told the nearest person to you right now to 'F**k off' how much trouble would you get into?	The owner of my company works right in front of my current desk. (He thinks I'm fixing a co-workers computer while she's away. I just don't like my desk because everyone can see when I'm on reddit.) If I said fuck off to him I don't think it would matter. He's 90 and basically deaf. He would have no idea what I said... There' an idea... I will let you know how it goes.	My nearest person is my 80-year old grandmother who is currently baking cookies for me. I would go to hell or reincarnate as a pill bug for the next millenia.	0
Travelers of Reddit, what is the most over-hyped destination that is not worth traveling to?	Paris and London. Some of the most impolite people I've ever met. Plus, London is semi-hideous, just this absurd mishmash of architectural styles that would probably all be fine on their own, but mixed together is extremely ugly. There are plenty of great places in the UK, but London is not it. France, well I'm not really a big fan of anywhere in France, which is mostly personal opinion, but I can definitely say the people are much nicer outside of Paris. I've traveled all over Europe, and I would say go just about anywhere other than Paris or London.	Leaning Tower of Pisa. It's a tower. It's slightly leaning. It's surrounded by 5000 tourists photographing themselves holding up the leaning tower. They're surrounded by 10,000 grifters.	0
[Serious] Reddit, what is the worst secret your SO is keeping from you, but that you actually know?	She didn't really get her tire slashed while she was at work - she hit a curb hard enough for the tire to blow while turning into the parking lot.	My ex gf, Debbie, was planning on having sex with a guy in February a few years ago. She thought I didn't know but I sure as fuck did. Long story short we broke up. Am I angry about it? No. See she was an older women who never had kids and was never married. At her age she'll be barren soon if she's not already and she's so crazy that nobody would marry her. I take solace in the fact that nomatter how much she hurt me she will never have a family and she'll die alone. I'd say that is punishment enough.	1
Your son can become a wizard by never having sex or masturbating until age 30. How would you raise him?	My "Son"? Bitch please, I'd be a god damn wizard already, ain't nobody got time for spitting out no babies.	If he can't keep himself from masturbating and having sex for wizard powers then it's probably for the best that he's not a wizard anyway	0
Law Enforcement Officers of Reddit: What is your opinion of the current state of affairs concerning American police brutality?	LEO here: To be quite honest, it isn't as bad as it seems. "Police Brutality" doesn't really exist in the way that people believe that it does. Contrary to that popular belief, the majority of cops do not wake up in the morning and tell themselves "I'm going to beat the shit out of someone today". Officers are more concerned about going home at the end of the day than anything else. These situations of Police Brutality seen in the media has mostly been an officer following use of force procedures. It is really hard for an officer to make any arrest, where someone is passively resisting, look pretty to the public. The people do have power and when they see something they don't like it pressures officers to resign and destroys their public image even though they were only doing their job.	In a country of 300+ million people, if the media wanted to, they can portray just about any event as an epidemic in order to stir the pot and sell more ad space. And that's exactly what they want to do, so they do it. They know what sells in today's climate.	0
Have you ever hit on the cute cashier? How did it go?	Cute cashier girl keeps making mistakes. Ringing things up twice. Ect. Cashier: "im sorry about that this is only my second day" Me: "hey, no problem. Its uhh... Kinda cute." Cashier: "really?" She blushes. Dude behind me:" your both cute. Want a threesome?" What the fuck is wrong with you dude? Easily the weirdest cock block I've ever experienced.	I told her I liked her dreads and that I used to have them in college. She asked why I cut them off. I told her because I had to get a real job. "Well this is my real job" I don't go to that Whole Foods any more	0
what irrational fears did you have as a kid?	I once saw my parents putting on new wallpaper *on top of the old*. This lead to nightmares about the room getting smaller and smaller, too small to live in	Tornados, from the time Twister came out even still to this day at the age of 27 99% of my nightmares involve tornados and whenever the weather gets bad I'm scared ones going to touchdown out of nowhere... fucking Bill Paxton	1
NSFW If men menstruated, how would personal hygiene products be marketed to them?	I feel like if men got periods they wouldn't work through it, it'll be like the man flu to them. So the products would encourage them to take a day off. But then you'd have drugs to help with symptoms which would be like the snickers advert, 'youre not you when you're hungry', type thing. Because everyone knows popping pills makes you feel better, the same way that eating nuts dipped in chocolate make you less hangry.	Nose bleed metaphors everywhere. You'd see like lumberjacks who get a blood nose and keep on working anyway. They would never actually show the hygiene product, they'd just put huge emphasis on working through the problem	0
What would the last 5 pictures on your cell phone say about you?	It would say, "Hey, why doesn't this guy have any pictures on his phone?" "Is that weird,.....I think that's weird."	My 16 year old drove off for the first time. My dog is adorable when she sleeps on the couch on her back. She snores, too. My 14 year old figured out the password to my phone and took the ugliest selfie that is now my wallpaper. I was having a great hair day so I took a car selfie to show my bestie. My husband's day was brightened by a picture of boobs after I came down to a cleaned kitchen.	1
What's something you HATE hearing people complain about?	People who complain about the current generation. They don't seem to realize that the same thing happens with every generation.	Rape Culture. Apparently because I'm not talking about how awful it is 24/7, I support it Edit: *sort by: Controversial thanks for my my first top controversial comment	1
What is one thing everyone should know?	If your resting face does not have a smile on it, make an effort to change that. The world treats you better when you're smiling/	That you aren't under the microscope you think you are. So be yourself, enjoy the activities, music, movies, books and people you like and stop worrying about what other people might think or say.	0
Reddit, what was 'The Scandal' at your high school?	A lot the guys shared an email file with over 200 different female students nudes and one students moms nude photo. One of the boyfriends got mad and ruined it for everyone.	We had a charity thing in highschool where you'd raise money for cancer. The amount being raised was shown on a thermometer and every limit would force a teacher to shave their head. On the very top was this french teacher. Anyways the initiative was due to finish after lunch recess, a bunch of people are in gym shaving their heads and trying to raise money, bills are flying down from the bleachers and we raise justtt enough money right at the bell. The french teacher was not down and ran away causing all the students to chase her into the bathroom banging on the door and shit. She soon after had a bit of a mental breakdown, someone at school found out her lava life profile and she left. Also, some student stole all the money raised in the initiative from the gym.	0
What is something you've been doing for a long time that you then achieved in a much painfully simpler way in a sort of shortcut manner?	Trying to fuck women by dating, spending money and being witty charming and funny etc to end up not getting laid or having to commit and a disdain for oral sex. Jus fuck guys with zero of the bullshit and a tighter hole	Unloading the dishwasher became so much simpler when i started grouping like utensils together in the basket. When I realized there's an arrow by the fuel gauge telling me which side the gas tank is on.	0
Parents of Reddit, do you regret what you named your child(ren) and why?	Not for a second. My daughter is named after my wife's mother (a shortened version of her name) who passed away when she was a girl, so that choice was really easy and we love the name. We agonized for months over my sons name. We finally just picked one and we both love it, now. Once it is your kids name it stops being a name and becomes a part of your child, and at least in my experience, I don't regret anything about my kids.	My name is Princess and my mom has mentioned to me before that she wished she would've given me a Hawaiian name since I was born there. I don't like my name sometimes but I've gotten so used to the "Is that really your name?" question that I've started introducing myself as "Princess. Ya, for real."	0
Airport employees of Reddit, what is the strangest, funniest, scariest thing that happened at your airport?	I just want to shout to to any TSA employees who work the checkpoints. You guys get a lot of flak for TSAs policies that you have nothing to do with. You're just trying to start or maintain a career, or waiting for the next thing. You guys bust your ass and work all kinds of crazy hours and shifts for a bunch of people who aren't grateful at all. Oh and you get paid absolute s***. Props, thanks for keeping our skies safe, and keeping out the crazies. Edit: downvotes? You people are monsters, I'm speaking to real people, like you and I, with jobs and ends to meet. Not a government agency.	A little different, but I work Avionics on F-22s in the Air Force. Most of the work is done outside. One day on mid shift we get told to go inside, turn off the lights, and not look outside. Not knowing what the hell was going on, we obviously complied. Once everyone was inside, the big stadium lights that covered the entire airfield were turned off and all the entire airfield was dark. We heard low rumbling in the distance that was getting closer and rumors started flying. We were under attack, aliens, you name it. Eventually we could hear 3 large planes fly very low overhead and be gone. After 15 more minutes we were given the go ahead to go back outside and back to work. To this day I still don't know what the hell happened.	0
Appraisers of Reddit, Have you ever seen anything on Pawn Stars that you know the appraiser got wrong?	Not Pawn Stars but once on Storage Wars they found some old German currency from the 1910s. I'm a collector, so I knew the pieces were worth only a few dollars each, but the """""expert""""" valued them for thousands and awed at their rarity (they aren't rare at all). It was pretty funny.	They had a guy named Robert Moseley (VideoBob) come on and hawk his replica proton pack from Ghostbusters. That they gave him any money was insane, as his props are shoddy pieces of shit on their best day. Edit: Thanks for the downvote, Bob. Keep up the shitty recasts and warped shells, you useless fuck.	1
Formerly racist people of reddit, what happened that made you think "Maybe that group of people isn't so bad after all"?	Not necessarily racist, but after living with a Muslim and having stayed in two different Muslim countries I realized Islam wasn't just bad, it was fucking horrible.	Not really just racist but aslo homophobic... my husband had some very narrow views when we were first dating. It was nearly a deal breaker. Also raised in the south and had teenage years in a rural town in CT. I talked frequently about my friends and family, he liked them when they met, and he'd be surprised about their race or sexual orientation. He came around 100% when we drove by a park, and from a distance saw a couple making out. He said, "awww, they're in love!" As we approached he said, "That's 2 dudes." *pause... "but they're still in love!! Love is good." And gave me a smooch.	0
People say in order to become an expert at something you need to put 10,000 hours into it. What have you put at least 10,000 hours of your life into?	Twerking, everyday I get home from work and twerk for four hours, on weekends eights hours. I once unzipped a girls fly with my sweet, sweet buns.	I just checked my /played in World of Warcraft to see how close I was...I regert everything. Worst part is, it was >10,000 hours in one class.	0
What was the worst period of your life, and how did you recover?	I dated a lowlife. Then the heavens opened up and I found my Angel. He completes me. There will be nobody else for me but him.	I spent 1 year getting rejected at interviews. I used to be excellent at academics and go to a brand name uni, and yet it was hard to get an interview call and even harder to crack the final round. I have a huge student loan and was crumbling under immense pressure. It seemed likeit wouldnt end but i kept working on it thinking I just need to crack one interview. I dealt with it by letting myself cry, it hurt a lot. When I received a job offer, i cried out of exhaustion it felt like i had been running a race. I just want you to know that this will pass and there's sth good in store for you.	0
What about this sub do you hate the most?	People complaining about reposted questions. Shut up. Most of the time you'll get people who weren't around the last time the question was posted, or got there too late, who will post new stories and stuff in the comments	Not hate but I find it strange that the same question gets asked over and over again. Sometimes it gets the the front page and sometimes it doesn't, I feel it's the answers that get the post to the front page.	0
People who took a year or so off before starting college, what do you learn and where did you go?	70% of students who take a year off do not go back. 90% of students who take a year off never graduate. So it's going to be tough to find a person to answer this.	I learned that 1 year turns into many years which turns into a military enlistment to pay for college. Then you go back feeling like Billy Madison.	0
What's a job you romanticized in your head that was not as fun as you thought it'd be?	Stay at home mom. It's NOT the Peggy Bundy lifestyle. I still have to maintain a house which is destroyed several times a day by a rambunctious toddler, I'm up numerous times with him and the baby during the night, there's never a day off, no sick days, and free time is limited to their naps. I'm much more exhausted now than when I was working full time plus overtime.	I always thought lawyers lived the high life. Nowadays there are a lot of unemployed law graduates or those that have been hired but don't make much. Also, most never go into a court room.	0
Reddit, would you/did you circumcise your son? Why or why not?	> I want to circumcise any future sons of mine Mind if I ask why the fuck you'd like to take sharpened tools to hack off part of your newborn son's body? I'm guessing "because skywizard", but am also willing to accept "because pseudoscience" or "because ill-informed".	I'm surprised no one has pointed out that if you have a foreskin, you can hold onto the end of it, pee, and laugh as your foreskin inflates like a balloon.	0
Reddit, what's the single greatest thing you've witnessed someone do in public?	I once saw a man running to catch up with friends trip on the uneven sidewalk. As he was falling he put his hands down and used his momentum to perform a handspring sort of move, land on his feet and continue running. It was fucking fantastic.	_..--""-. .-""--.._ _.-' \ __...----...__ / '-._ .' .:::...,' ',...:::. '.

What's the ballsiest thing you've ever seen someone do?	I watched a guy steal a girl's iPod and, as he ran off, she threw her backpack like you'd do a hammer toss and nailed him in the back of the head. She casually caught up to him, picked up her backpack and iPod, and returned to where she was standing.	Last night I saw a general who became a slave. The slave then became a gladiator. The gladiator (still the same f**king guy) defies the f**king emperor!! And, oh yeah... he wins.	1
Men of Reddit, which behaviors of other men would you like to see less of, or more of?	More cleaning up after yourselves in the fucking bathroom. I shouldn't have to clean another grown man's piss off a toilet seat because you're too lazy to lift it.	Not apologizing all the time. Not being ashamed of being a man. And stop treating women like flawless angels, always having them take the lead in relationships. And realize that if you choose to open up your emotions to a woman, you will be seen as less sexy. Women will tell you that this is not true, but it absolutely is. They want "guys" to be more emotionally open, but the sexy guys are the "naturally stoic" ones. Decide for yourself which is more important.	1
People who've had a breast augmentation - what do you wish you'd known before your procedure?	They will grow back!!! I was young when I had my surgery.... 6 years later, they are back to the same size, just shaped better.	I'm a nurse in a plastics clinic and I wish that peoole understood that the post op care is not a suggestion, it is mandatory. We have seen many people that did not follow the instructions and came back with hefty complications requiring more surgery. It is a MAJOR surgery, it is not something that you decide after discussing with your girlfriends over a glass of wine. You go through consults, the surgeon tells you what he's going to do and how he will do it. The recovery is 2 months, you will have sutures and drains sticking out of you, and you will have to wear an ugly binder.	0
What is the most inappropriate answer you've ever given in an interview?	Dumb broad for not being amused. It's the perfect answer. I was interviewing for a bank teller job, and the branch manager asked what my best attribute was. I scratched my chin beard and looked at the ceiling, deep in thought, and replied..."Geez, I'm not sure which one to pick...there are so many." They sent me a "Don't call us, we'll call you" e-mail a week or so later.	In an interview for a programming job I was asked to pretend the interviewer knew nothing about computers and to try to explain to her what the internet is. I replied with "It's a series of tubes."	0
What's the worst bullying you've ever encountered/witnessed?	Are we going to answer the question or sit here and tell "true" stories of how we stopped bullies in non-remarkable bullying scenarios? My worst: girl (quite striking I might add) was bullied so much she transferred schools all because she was a redhead with freckles and dated an unpopular guy. Called her burn victim and shit like that. Should have been a white knight and gotten a piece of that (I reiterate she was sexy as hell). Damn.	I attended college in Buffalo and someone pulled a fire alarm at 3 am in the beginning of December. That sucked. Two kids decided to completely pants this kid who was there on a special needs program (he was autistic). As them and their cronies were laughing up a storm he nervously laughed and pulled up his pants. Me being a 6'6 barrel chested viking/gorilla hybrid, I went up to the kid who did it, and shoved him to the ground. His buddy approached me as if he was going to attempt to get in my face and in the most furious moment of my life screamed at him to back the fuck up or I'll make sure he ends up in the hospital. I've never seen more terror in a mans face. I got an applause and was sort of a hero in the dorm	0
Today, a homeless looking man handed me $50 and this note. Do any of you have any idea what it means?	132.96.235.251 converted to hex: 2220944379. That IP is from Fort Huachuca in AZ. Edit: Fort Huachuca is the command center for NETCOM, which "protects and operates Army Cyberspace" Edit 2: Friedman Hall at Fort Huachuca is named for a famous cryptographer, and apparently well a guarded "Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility."	I bet OP will bring the girlfriend (or SO) and ~~purpose~~ propose. This could be an excellent stunt to stir up a very public proposal	1
What is the most brutal, emotionally destructive insult you know?	My older brother and I were adopted. Our parents got divorced, and our dad remarried. He and our stepmom had two biological kids. Our youngest sister once said to me, “Dad doesn’t need you anymore now that he has his real kids.”	Besides the N word which is obvious, I once had someone call my husband a murderer for being a military serviceman. That really hit home, maybe because like many other military personnel he has had to take lives and it pissed me off. So much so that I retaliated against her.	1
How would you feel about a law limiting the top earner of a corporation to earn 50x that of the lowest full-time earner (i.e if the people flipping burgers full-time at a fast food chain earn 30k a year, the CEO is limited to making 1.5mil a year)?	Swiss here. We had an initiative (vote) on a law like that (limiting the possible salary of the boss of a firm to 12x the salary of the lowest paid employee). The pros were: "that should reduce the huge inequalities in income in the same firm", but the big con was: "well they would just create a sub-company with the low paying jobs". The law was rejected by the people.	I said this as a warning to my former business partner, and I'll say it to the next employee that turns out to be a lazy piece of shit: I'd rather throw an extra $3k on ads than pay you for riding my coat tails. I don't work 60+ hours a week to pay someone else for my hard work. I'm currently working out licensing structure that will reward good workers with a chance to own their own business, while paying me licensing rights for the brand, the buying power. But they how get to turn that hard work and willingness to grow into their own business. Make your own way, whatever that means, or don't bitch about not making enough money.	1
I quit my job after telling off a four year old for shaking his cup at me. What's the dumbest thing that has set you off at work?	Not me, but an acquaintance. She was worked at a grocery store in the produce section for a few years. She was stocking the bananas and a customer came up to her, grabbed a bunch of bananas, held it up and said rather sharply, "These bananas are green!" To which she clapped her hands and said, "Very Good." Got Fired	I dated this girl for six years. I had intentions of buying a ring. Two weeks before we were supposed to visit her folks upstate (which I had decided was a good time to ask her father for his blessing) she dumped me, claiming that she just didn't see our relationship going anywhere. That would have been nice to know, oh, I don't know, *sometime in the last 5 years..*	1
Reddit, what's something stupid you've done recently that (thankfully) nobody else witnessed?	I scooped the litter box and put all the poop and piss back into the fresh litter jug. I just tossed the whole thing and bought a new one.	Got into the elevator and pushed the button for the floor I was already on instead of the floor I wanted to get to. Spent the next minute admiring my new mittens in a stationary elevator.	0
My friend recently came out that he's gay, which is cool. But he thinks I'm gay too and it's gotten violating. What should I do?	He doesn't think you're gay, he wants you to be gay because **he's attracted to you**. You need to be very clear and assertive about what you want and what you don't, and if he doesn't stop you need to put some distance between yourself and him. As for you being uncomfortable around gay guys. They feel the same way about men that you do for women, it's that simple. Your friend sounds like he's being a pushy sex pest, this could happen with women too, it's not just a gay thing. Please keep that in mind.	It sounds to me that he might be attreacted to you. What you may want to try doing is sitting him down in private, and telling him "Look, I am straight and your making me a little uncomfertable with all of this, I enjoy our friendship but thats all it is right now" On a side note if you are still figuring your self out you could always just think things over or give some things a try. After all sexuality changes over time for some people.	1
What are people in your country proud of that actually kind of sucks?	Our working culture. Some people take pride in the fact that we get screwed by our employers. Its not admirable or healthy to work 51 40+ hour weeks out of the year for shit pay and zero/terrible benefits but if you don't you're considered lazy.	Rednecks driving around with big US flags on the back of their 4x4 truck and wearing a don't tread on me shirt.	1
Can you give one example of how easy it is for you to die during a typical day of yours?	It all depends on if the 30,000 gallon bottle of liquid propane outside my office decides to blow up or not.	In the warmer months I travel around riding dirt bikes on terrain that no body has business being on even to hike. Also I am constantly souring 100+ feet 20-30 feet in the air with dozens of people behind me and in front of me doing the same thing on 200lb+ dirt bikes. I also ride a jetski at 70mph, wake board and tube. In the winter I am constantly at around 80-100mph on snowmobile on tight terrain where one wrong move can throw me into a tree or another snowmobiler. I also snowboard on terrain not suitable for hiking down 70%-90% grades, jumping off cliffs into trees that are barely shoulder width apart. I have a choice to be in these situations but it's the only way I can survive.	1
Identical twins of Reddit: what are some of the morally questionable things you've done to people around you that no one knows of?	When I was overseas on a deployment, I had fraud on my bank of america account. They wouldn't do anything for me unless I went into the branch. So I sent my sister my ID and she went in for me to fix it.	Am identical twin. We looked a lot alike when we were younger, but I really have nothing to contribute to this post. Sorry. Have an upvote for trying though	1
What is something someone said that changed your way of thinking forever?	"Big government" is like giving a man a fish. "Small government" is like teaching a man *how* to fish. It was a relative's way of teaching me about Democratic government and Republican government when I was 12. Edited to add: I *knew* this would get ignorant down votes with no discussion. pfft	Got this one from someone on reddit: "If he/she's one in a million, there's 11 of him/her in Ohio." Edit: gender neutral	0
Ladies, what are some things in a guy's apartment that set off red flags?	His pet rat free to roam the dining table. I'm fine with rodents, but not where you make food. The 3 other rats in the freezer, waiting for the fourth and lone survivor to kick it so they could all be cremated together, was a line well crossed however.	Toy figurines still in their packaging. Edit: negative? Wonder how many boys with sheathed Hans Solo’s are on this thread then!!	1
Police Officers of Reddit. What are the best speeding ticket excuses you've heard? Did you let them go?	Once I pulled a kid about 11 years old over that was driving his Dad's truck without his knowledge. The kid ran through a couple of trash cans, hit a mailbox, then stopped dead and the kid jumped out, laid down on his tummy with his hands behind his head. I walked up to him, pulled him up, calmed him down and asked him what was going on. He confessed that he stole his dad's keys and wallet in order to buy Borderlands 2 from Walmart. Got the whole thing on dashcam if anybody wants to see it. Edit: I wanted to let him go, but he damaged property and his dad needed the police report for the insurance. No charges were pressed.	When I was an MP I had a 1 star tell me "I'm General such and such!" I looked at his uniform, then to his ID. I told him, "Yes sir, that seems to be correct. Here is your ID, registration, and DD FM 1805 (army tickets)	0
What is one thing about the opposite gender that boggles your mind?	Women holding grudges against other women for seemingly no reason. A man will hate another man for a reason, like so-so got you fired, or fucked your woman, or slew your family. With women it's: "I hate that bitch" "What did she do?" "She is a total bitch to me" "In what way?" "I think she's talking about me behind my back" "What's she saying about you?" "That's just it, I don't know, she's such a sneaky bitch about it! I hate her even more now." "Has anyone actually said she's talking about you?" "No, probably cus her rumors made them hate me now!"	Penises. Seriously, they're just so weird. I can't imagine what it's like to have this floppy appendage between your legs, that apparently has a mind of its own. And just the whole notion of erections, and adjusting yourself is just bizarre. I'd seriously give just about anything to swap bodies with a man for a day, just so I could see what it's like to *be* a man. Edit: for those of you commenting about women having "floppy appendages" on their fronts, yeah, sorry, that's another thing that boggles my mind. I only wish I had much in the way of floppy appendages to have to adjust and deal with, but some of us aren't so blessed. (and yes, I know I'm about to get deluged by comments from women with huge tits about how much it sucks. I've heard it before.)	0
Dear reddit, do you think it is more difficult to be an Unattractive woman or an Unattractive man?	Unattractive man. Even unattractive women can get laid if they advertise that they're cock hungry. There's a reason stereotypical nerds/virgins are mostly guys.	As a guy, I think being an unattractive woman might be more difficult. It just feels as if men can get more attractive with way less effort than women. That said, being an unattractive anything is pretty much fucked in general.	0
To Non-Westerners: What things about Western culture in general do you find odd?	Kenyan checking in. *Eye contact. Oh my God, SO MUCH eye contact. Meeting people for the first time and having them peer into your freaking soul. Took some getting used to. *The low power distance between authority figures and the general population. Teachers/politicians/doctors/parents... etc command a lot more respect here and people are more reverential in their dealings with them. *The power play and divisions within schools, especially high school. I thought Hollywood had exaggerated this, but reddit tells me otherwise. (More American, than 'Western') *The fact that you can spread peanut butter and jam on bread and call it a sandwich. Wut? :P I have more but I'm on my phone right now, will update.	Lots of people are saying they think it's weird Americans wear their shoes in the house. Personally, I'd rather you wore your shoes in my house. I hate feet. I hate knowing bare feet are in the room.	1
What are some good ways to burglar proof your home?	Just having a sign outside your home that says you're protected by XYZ security company is a good deterrent, even if you don't really have the service.	This might sound a little dark, but laughed hard when my friend told me... Her bike kept getting stolen from her out house / shed type thing... So after the 3rd time of it happening, before she went out of town one time... Strung up by the neck a dummy... (Burglars broke in, immediately faced with what they believe in the dark, a hanging corpse) LOL .. She heard screams and no one ever stole her bike again . Love that bitch haha	1
Do women find penises attractive the way men find vaginas and breasts attractive?	I want to jump in a bathtub full of them. Especially if they aren't circumcised. I'm also aroused by severe cases of HPV and herpes.	For me, a married female, it works kind of like food. You know how things like Mac n Cheese or stroganoff aren't really that pretty, but they are awesome and make you feel good and you want them no matter their presentation? Penis. And then there are things that catch your eye because they are pretty and interesting but not necessarily what you'd want for dinner, like fruit tarts or a cake from cake boss? Boobs. It's not like I don't like Mr. Profits's penis, but...it's a winner more for its personality than its looks.	0
Redditors who have gone to customers homes for your job, what is the worst you've seen?	Delivered furniture to a house that stunk so bad we had to like hold our breath. It was a brisk 55ish degrees outside but it was like 85 in this house. All the lights in the house were off except for the light in the room down the hall way we were supposed to put the new sofa in. We asked to turn on some lights and were told "nah, it's good, it's just going in here." there were probably 20 people in the house and when we entered the room for the sofa there was a teenage kid that came out of a little closet with what looked like puke on his shirt and said "where u taking that sofa?" We said we were just delivering it he said ok and went back into the closet. Weirdest day of my life.	I saw someone let their kid sleep on an old dog bed stuffed with wigs. Saw a prostitute stab a clown One time saw a basketball hoop was that was actually made out of a ribcage A blind guy bite a police horse A bathroom so bad it made a puppy commit suicide One houseowner bit into a burrito and there was a child's shoe in it. A hooker eating a tire outside on the sidewalk. A pack of wild dogs took over and successfully ran a Wendy's. One time had to go to a housing project named after Zachary Taylor, generally considered one of the worst presidents of all time. Once saw a baby give another baby a tattoo and they were both very drunk.	1
What first date behavior is a deal breaker, regardless of other qualities?	The only tinder date I have ever been on. Things were fine until I noticed that the tops of her feet were tattooed with portraits of John Wayne Gacy and Charles Manson. Across her toes were the words "party dudes". When I asked her what was up with that, she said "I just think they were really intelligent, misunderstood guys."	Being a social justice warrior/third wave feminist. Believing the gender wage gap myth. Calling themselves an "activist". Supporting ANTIFA. I just couldn't see myself being with a staunch liberal.	1
If a hacking organisation managed to systematically wipe out all forms of debt, both international and domestic, in a 1 hour period, what would the next year to a decade look like?	Most average people would be in good standing. Even if this lead to massive unemployment, most regular people work primarily to pay off their mortgage and their car note. With those gone, all you need to worry about is food and the necessities. Universities run on a debt based model. Most colleges would go bankrupt, and in many instances, the students will respond to this by taking over the colleges and conducting education themselves. Need textbooks? well fuck a contract with pearson, we are pirating everything and distributing it to the students for free. I imagine there would be new focuses of study coming to prominence, like training urban farmers and a new wave of electrical engineers to rig up the existing electronics to meet new purposes, because with the national and global economy in crisis I doubt the new iPhone 7 is going to be shipping.	Isn't my bank account basically a debt that my bank owes me? This would effectively wipe out the entire financial system except for actual physical money that people have in their possession.	0
For the redditors that have retired and are living off their life savings. Do you wish you had spent more or less money when you were younger, living in the moment vs. saving for the future?	I'm not retired. But I'll tell you what. My friend who has a networth of well over 2 million bucks spent a LOT of his money on Chocolate Turtles. And I like apple pie but he disagrees so we just argue back and forth about ice cream most of the time.	I'm in my 40's and recently moved about 600 miles. I did a lot of purging along the way. My greatest regret that will probably haunt me in my later years is all the impulse purchases. The THINGS I buy, not the experiences I've paid for. I have no regrets about how much a hotel cost me or a great dinner in a fun city. I hate that have boxes of clothes and things in my garage that I don't need and haven't touched in months. I imagine when I'm retired, I'll feel the same. Never too late to change, right? Right? RIGHT?!?!	0
People of Reddit, what’s one seemingly insignificant decision/mistake you made in your life that actually completely changed your life?	Being to nice? Got stabbed, lied to, pinned on the be the scapegoat and bullied. Finally learnt my lesson and returned the favour to those who used me, now when they see me they walk the other way (not gonna lie, I might have went a bit overboard but years of depression and sadness turned into pure anger. I was out for blood~)	June 6th, 1994. Dad came to our house to take my 12 year old sister to see The Flintstones in the theater. He asked if I wanted to come along as well. Being 17 and having just graduated high school a week before, I thought I was way too cool to see the fucking Flintstones with my dad and sister. About 30 minutes later I find out they were in a car accident. At the hospital I learn my sister instantly died in the passenger seat because she was facing my dad with her back to the window. Car hit my dad's side and messed him up real bad, but the force cause her to hit her head back on the window. If I had gone, she would have been in the back and I likely wouldn't have been sitting like that. It's something I think about every day.	0
elementary school teachers, what is the most disgusting thing you have seen a child do?	I took over coaching for a 9-10 year old's field hockey team in NZ. Partway through the game, I asked one of our players to take over goal-tending so he ran back to the goalie to send him up to defense. The kid in net popped out his mouthguard and handed it to the new goalie, who then popped it in his mouth.	I was a student so... I don't know fucking stab me I guess but anyway the kid shat his pants, let a little, tiny bit out onto the floor, and tried to hide the rest in his pants... yeah... Also a cunt once put my hat in the urinal... that was pretty disgusting.	1
What is the fastest you've seen someone get fired?	5 hours. I told the story yesterday. Guy faked his way into a job with fake references and fake transcripts from LSU. He only passed the interview because the interviewer was a moron (also fired shortly thereafter)... this guy had no clue about the job. 5 hours into his first day, we confirmed with LSU that he'd never been a student there and this was the THIRD time he'd pulled this stunt. He had already displayed his LSU diploma, tiger statue, and a commemorative football helmet in his office. Watching him pack up his shit was glorious.	I work in an accounting firm and this one guy comes in and was being shown around the office and he just casually hit on one of my coworkers. Our manager then just asked what accounting software he preferred and his response was: "oh I lied about all that stuff on my resume. I don't know what you're even talking about." and our manager just said aloud: "your fired!". Dudes response was: "So I just go out the way a came in?" He *literally* did one circle around our cubicles and was fired. Edit: I must've missed the serious tag. My bad.	1
Teachers of Reddit, what is the weirdest/stupidest thing a student has done?	Saw a fourteen-year-old boy stuffing tissue down his shirt to staunch bleeding from several wounds. Took him out in the hall to ask him what was up. Turned out that he had discovered some blasting caps in his dad's shed. He placed them on an anvil and hit them with a hammer. KABOOM and the shrapnel went into his chest. "Please don't tell my dad; he'll kill me!" Took that lad to the hospital.	My mother is a teacher. Her student a few years ago swallowed a living goldfish whole for ten bucks then accidentally dropped the money in the tank. He didn't notice until the bill was completely soaked and just about destroyed.	1
What's the smallest purchase you've made that changed your life?	An OBD-II reader. That's what those guys at Autozone use to scan your check engine light. It cost me less than $20 and has probably saved me hundreds. You can plug it into just about any modern car, write down the numbers it spits out, and throw them in google to find out exactly what's wrong with your car. Half the time it's something you can fix yourself instead of taking to a mechanic and that saves a lot of money. I've become the go to guy for any of my friends and family if they have a check engine light come on.	A bought a 25 sheet of LSD from the blackmarket 12 years ago for $100. It came in fine but sure enough I got too cocky and sold to an undercover and got 10 years in jail	1
Teachers of Reddit, what's the most heartbreaking thing you've ever discovered about a student?	I'm not a teacher but I won't answer the question because I fail to qualify for the basic requirements to do so.	My wife’s story who is a 3rd grade teacher Had a young boy in class who was deaf. She found out that his parents were meth heads and actually were sticking q tips and other things in his ear causing them to lose hearing. He lives with his grandma now and his parents are in prison, thankfully. Not a lot of shit makes me cry but every time I think about this it makes me tear up. We went over to their house and me and my wife’s brother built a wheelchair ramp for the grandma so she could get her grandkids to school easier. Meeting the little boy made it all the more real. It’s truly heartbreaking	0
What is the dumbest way you've ever injured yourself?	I shut my own head in a car door while trying to quickly get into said car. To this day I'm still not sure how I managed it.	When I was 13 or so, my sister and I were in the kitchen, joking around. She pulled out a big ass knife and pretended to threaten me. As she did this, she began to sneeze. This was no ordinary sneeze, however. The build up sounded like a bloodthirsty battle cry, and as I turned to face her (I was initially turned the other way) I saw her screech and lunge (sneeze reflex) towards me with the knife. Being the coordinated person I am, I jumped up, and smashed straight into the fridge, dislocating my shoulder.	0
People of reddit, instead of missed hints what hint(s) did you catch that got you laid?	I was playing Halo with a bunch of people in my dorm, and this one otherwise-polite girl kept humping my corpse. We're married now.	She said "Oh don't you dare look back, Just keep your eyes on me" I said "You're holding back" then she said "Shut up and dance with me" I got laid that night.	1
Today in school, a guy hit another student over the head with a baseball bat because he stole a firework or two off of him. What is the absolute craziest shit to have ever happened in your school?	When I was I'm school one fine young gentleman through the front window of our school right next to the front door it remained covered with plywood for the rest of the year.	We had a minor "race riot". 8-10 black kids jumped two white metalheads in the parking lot. Well the metalheads at our school were a serious minority and tended to stick together so about 15-20 metalheads jumped in to help the victims so more black kids jumped in. The really bad part was most people don't realize how well armed an 80's metalhead was just by the virtue of their clothing. The spiked belts and armbands started flying and about a dozen people went to the hospital.	0
Doctors of Reddit, what's your "I got it wrong" story?	Not a doctor, or a nurse, or have a job in medicine or a related field, or in med school, or in school for a medical field, or have any interest in understanding medicine and the human body, but one time, at my current programming job, I sent too many changes at once and our internal server crashed multiple times. I learned to try to send code changes in small pieces, because it helps to prevent bugs and make any bugs that do appear easier to track down.	Am in medical school and will be a doctor in 8ish months, I get it wrong all the time. My teachers get it wrong significantly less than me, but they do look thinks up on UpToDate at least once per day. I'm hoping I'll eventually become competent to only look things up once per day. My worst example: thinking a female patient had vaginosis because there was a strong, pungent odor when conducting a pelvic exam. Turns out she just had really smelly feet.. EDIT: thank you for the PMs, didn't think this would be a post that would prompt them, but I'll take it lol	0
What's the coolest story you've ever heard about one of your ancestors?	One day my grandmother's uncle was sitting on a bench in Poland. A stranger sat down next to him on the bench. The two got to talking and had a great conversation. Eventually it comes to light that the stranger is actually Pope John Paul the second. My relative didn't believe him when he said this. The Pope told him to visit him sometime at the Vatican if he didn't believe him. He would eventually visit the Vatican and when he asked to see the Pope he was denied. He told them to tell the Pope that he was the man from the bench in Poland. Pope John Paul said to let him through and they had another conversation and it turns out he he was actually the Pope.	I had this one relative a long time ago who Conquered England. I hear he was kind of a Bastard though because of his iron Will.	1
What's the worst thing you've ever tried?	Beer, I can drink any hard liquor you set in front of me, but beer is fucking gross. Edit: I guess there are some beer drinkers who take offense?	Tried climbing over an electric fence. Touched it first to confirm it was off and then grabbed with both hands and swung a leg over. I now know the electricity comes in pulses vs. a continuous flow.	0
Why don't we buck the trend? Guys of reddit, when have you been awkwardly hit on by women?	All my stories of creepy getting hit on by women occur with cougars. I guess its my fault seeing that I do hang out at a cougar bar with my bros from time to time.	Way back in HS I was working with my lab partner in marine biology and she got really close to my face and asked if I had pizza for lunch. I looked at her confused and said yes then went back to the project. She moved in closer and just kept looking at me and then said that I wasn't very good at flirting.	0
What is the most misused word in the English language?	Depression or being depressed. All these people always tweet about being depressed. As someone who has it, I don't think it's something everyone should act like they have. Mental illnesses aren't fun.	I'm shocked that it hasn't already been mentioned in this thread, but "travesty" should be near the top of the list. Many people think that it is a synonym of "tragedy," and it's not. It really means a mockery of something in a serious sense of the word...for example, a travesty of justice CAN be a tragedy (and almost always is), but that phrase is used to described something that has made a mockery of a legal system.

What's the cheapest thing your family did growing up?	My dad never liked paying for the bill at Red Robin and that's where I liked to go for my birthday every year, so my dad would always make a scene and complain to the manager until her at least got a free meal coupon	My dad and I would play "hit the log with the rock". We played it a few times a week when he got home from work and i loved it. I would get home from school before him and gather about 30-50 "good" rocks for throwing. Little did I know, dad was stressed at work with very little money and that was what he came up with to play a few evenings a week. My dad was embarrassed by this game and some of his home made toys although I look very fondly on these memories.	0
Waiters/waitresses of Reddit, what do we do as customers that we think is helping you out but actually makes your job more difficult?	There are times where I actually want my tables to hang out and camp for a little while. If it's towards the end of a shift and I see a fat, ugly family waiting up front for the next available table, I will do whatever it takes to keep my section full. If your server ever buys you a dessert for no apparent reason this is probably what's happening.	I disagree with what most servers are saying. The only thing that bothers me is when people take things off or load up my tray while I'm carrying it. Just don't touch it! It isn't always easy to balance a heavy tray of drinks and you will throw off my balance.	0
What is the best or worst experience you've had with the police?	Got woken up in the middle of the night to cops breaking in my front door and coming in with dogs through the window, and made to lie face down on my living room floor (nude, because I'd been sleeping in the nude) with their guns drawn on me. Turned out that my neighbor thought he'd seen someone breaking into my apartment and called the cops. Thank god I'm not black, or I probably wouldn't be typing this right now.	First time in Vegas I got so drunk I was committed to sleeping at the base of the stairs on the exterior of our shitty motel. It was part of a contiki tour and a total dump off the strip. I was so wasted I couldn’t walk up one flight of stairs. Out of the dark, deserted area in the middle of the night came a solo cop on foot. If I had been more with it I would have freaked out that I’d get arrested for public intoxication. But instead he proceeded to lift my deadweight (and fairly overweight) body up the flight of stairs and put me to bed. Another tour member informed me I tried to tip him $30, which he wouldn’t take. Then he vanished back into the night like a guardian angel.	0
Hairdressers/Barbers of Reddit: What's a hairstyle someone has requested that you've almost said "no" to?	Not exactly what you're looking for, but: I tried to 'tidy up' my cut between cuts. Used the equivalent of a '0' on the sides when I thought I had a 5. Tried to blend it out. Not a hairdresser. Finally decided it looked actually kind of gross, like 'I think that man over there is sick mommy'. Entire shop of about 10 hairdressers saw me walk in, left their chairs and crowded around to inspect the horror.	I've never been turned down by a hairdresser...? You gonna cut my hair or tell me to clean my room? Now give me that Adam Lambert fauxhawk and stfu	1
Who likes pineapple on pizza?	I like pineapple. I like pizza. I don't like pineapple on pizza. There's just something about mixing pineapple with cheese and tomato sauce that makes me gag.	So pineapple and black olives had been my go to pizza order for at least 15 years and was always the one with the disgusting pizza order. Then Deadpool had a pineapple and black olives pizza in it .... I felt validated. I will also always order a gourmet pizza if it has fruit on it, roasted apples on pizza is fantastic!	0
What cringey moment in your life still keeps you up at night when you randomly remember it?	When I was religious...yuck....asking strangers if they know Jesus....how could they not? He is mentioned in every script and there are ten churches on every road. People usually try to hide the truth and stuff the lies down your throat so which one do you think Christianity is?	I was either in first or second grade when this happened. Anyway our p.e. teacher was testing us by making us do sit ups. We were grouped in pairs and when it was my turn my partner was holding my ankles and foot. I did it but every time I did it I would fart and it wasn't one of those silent farts. No it made sound but stupid me didn't want to stop and neither did the farts.	0
What is something that most of Reddit acts like an expert on when in reality very few of us are experts on that topic?	Anything involving science. You can immediately tell whether or not someone on this site has been through the academia machine. It disturbs me how most redditors talk about scientists, like they're a collective of enlightened beings who have evolved beyond pettiness and bias toward their own work/source of funding. Scientists are people. Some of them are liars who will fabricate data and think nothing of it. Some of them are opportunists who will milk cancer research grants for all they're worth. Some of them will deny repeatable, verifiable data if it means protecting their own life's work.	Science, the amount of overly philosophical left wing liberals that collide in that section of this website make me vomit	1
Lawyers of Reddit, what are some of the strangest "Would it be illegal if I..." questions you have been asked?	Another sad one, but during the financial crisis I was asked numerous times whether a family would still get the life insurance payout if the person committed suicide.	Not a lawyer but I have a question. Say I'm taking a college course and I just bought the book. Would it be illegal to go home, scan every single page into a digital copy on my computer, refund the book the next day, then use my "free" e-copy for the class?	1
Ongoing sexual harassment from my landlord is making me extremely uncomfortable. What options do I have here?	I'm sorry but I fucking hate these posts. "Reddit, I believe the man I live with is a sexual predator who is constantly making unwanted, creep sexual advances. What do I do?" How old are you? 10?! Fucking leave or alert the authorities. I'm sorry you're in this situation but this is common sense 101.	>He got my room mate a Hello Kitty poster, telling her that he knows she likes Hello Kitty. The only Hello Kitty things she owns are 7 pairs of Hello Kitty underwear. Whoa whoa whoa, time to go!	0
Professors of Reddit: What is the most interesting way a student has tried to raise their grades in your class?	The other way around in my case: Teacher wanted to start a company with me and some friends; so he let us pass with best grades and no work done in his class. We were like unsuccessful versions of the *21* kids.	A fat guy in my class tried to come onto our 50 year old fat chemistry teacher during class to repeat an experiment. Needless to say megalulz	1
[Serious] Gun freedom advocates of reddit, how do you think we can decrease the number of mass shootings in the US?	I would think there has to be a major change in how mental health is done in this country. Also, there needs to be more open and honest conversation about how we as a culture can be better people. I don't think censorship will end these insane acts of violence, but better support, structure and comprehension of what is the root of the issue may help. Lets promote being good people. edit: Just got home from a funeral and didn't realize my inbox imploded while I was gone. Thank you to everyone who inboxed me with their opinions and sorry I didn't answer anyone!	A lot of gun advocates say they need protection from criminals with guns. I have a plan that will severely curtail illegal guns: 1. Every gun must be registered. All gun sales preceded by background checks. Govt pays for all of this. 2. If you lose or have a gun stolen, you report it immediately. 3. If you keep "losing" guns, you don't get to buy any more. 4. If a crime is committed with a gun you owned but sold without a background check, you are charged as an accomplice to the crime, unless you can prove you could not reasonably know your gun was missing.	1
What hobby can be done for cheap, but is full of snobs that will hate you for not going the super expensive route?	Drinking beer. If you don't want to pay extra for a craft beer which tastes marginally better than beers from the bigger breweries, then that is your preference.	You could get a fully functional remote control airplane for $100 and it'll fly fine. It'll teach you how to keep it airborne, it'll survive your inevitable wrecks and it'll be great fun while you own it. Show up to any kind of hobby meet with a $100 foam plane and no one will take you seriously. Apparently you don't know how to fly unless you invest thousands into basically the same design.	0
What is a massive plothole in a movies storyline that really irritates you?	When parents in Christmas movies don't believe in Santa but don't seem to realise the gifts that he left their children	In inception, they claim that you get stuck in limbo. So i don’t get how they could so easily get back to reality? It wouldn’t be such a problem since they can just die in limbo to come back.	1
What screams "I'm a terrible parent"?	People who spank their kids. They manage to resolve conflicts with their coworkers and peers without violence, but feel the need to beat someone who is powerless against them? I call bullshit. Edit: Wow downvote the person who doesn't hit kids. Looks like we have a lot of people on Reddit that can't handle their shit when confronted by a 3 year old. Hitting a person that has no recourse makes you lazy and a terrible parent. You are there to protect and teach them, not cause them pain.	Looking at your child and saying "You are the reason I don't want to come home after work" and "Nobody likes you when you (insert typical behavior of small child)", then after saying this to the oldest child, going to the youngest and saying "how's my baby? Awe such a big man, Mommy loves you".	0
What "deep thought" gives you the chills when it crosses your mind?	(1) We look at and learn about atoms and think "omg, so much empty space, electrons, tiny things, i bet tiny organisms are on these things." Meanwhile some kid in 10th grade in bio is looking at milky way through a microscope thinking, "omg these cells are so cool, what if (1)" boom.	Death, but not in a omg I dont wanna die kind of way. I try to imagine what its like to die, at that exact moment when you no longer exist, but my brain cannot comprehend what is happening, I then get excited about finding out (Not in a morbid way) what happens when I die, lets face it, its the only thing I have to wait my whole life to experience.	0
Let's talk airplane ettiquite, what are some do's and don'ts of flying on a passenger airplane?	The arm rest marks an invisible plane that extends to the ceiling, one which your arms are not to cross.	Please don't lean back all the way in your seat. You don't need to and it makes the person behind you very uncomfortable	1
What's something worth spending extra money on?	If you live in a country where it rains a lot: spend the extra bit on a WATERPROOF jacket. Not "rain blocking" or "shower resistant", waterproof. No worse feeling than cycling to college/work in the rain and sitting in damp clothes all day.	Tipping. Round it up. Give a little more than what's expected. I've never been regretful for tipping too much - but the feeling I didn't tip enough is uncomfortable.	1
The Guilt of (moderate) Wealth. Do any of you feel bad/guilty when you spend money on stuff that are not really essential for survival?	The money you give to a restaurant isn't lost; it goes to the restaurant's owner, to the employees, etc., who in turn use that to feed their families.	FUCK NO. I don't have anythign another human being doesn't have. I just work my ass off. When I was younger and my kids were kids (not adults like they are today) I worked 7 days a week 12-18 hours a day. Yes I am well off now, yes I enjoy spending my money on things, and not a single fuck is given.	1
Reddit, what was the meanest thing you have ever done to someone?	I had been dating my boyfriend for over a year, so, as expected, he had some "sexy pics" of me. Apparently he'd been dating another girl for almost just as long and she found the pictures. This girl decided it would be so hilarious to send them to my dad, resulting in me getting sent to an all female boarding school for two years. So i took the pictures of her on Facebook drinking and smoking and sent them to her college volleyball coach and dean. She lost her D1 scholarship and got kicked off the team. She goes to community college now. (yes, i feel guilty. No, I'm not usually this terrible of a person.) TL;DR Got a girl kicked out of college	Told a house-mate that it was no wonder her schizophrenic mother couldn't bear having my house-mate living with her... (she'd been in fostercare) This was after she had collected all of the dirty dishes etc in the house and placed it in front of the door to my room and had taken the vacuum and tied it around the doorknob so that I couldn't get in before I had removed everything. **EDIT:** They weren't my dishes	1
Why are you not friends with your former best friend?	It was pretty clear that she only moved in with me so I'd be the rent subsidy to her and her boyfriend (who was not on the lease, but moved in first week). I let that go on for six months before demanding to only pay a third. I was still naive about her and didn't realise I wasn't really her best friend until we stopped living together. And she didn't contact me for six months unless it was about me babysitting her cat for free.	My close friend in law school was in favor of the Confederate statues remaining and slowly revealed himself to be racist in his reasoning -- he literally *did not care* about the opinions of people of color on the matter, because "tradition" and "respect" and blah blah blah. Tradition and respect don't outweigh valid considerations about racism. What sort of "tradition" stems from 100 years after the (American) Civil War? And "respect" is one hell of a dog whistle in this context. Unfriended. Haven't spoken to him since. He wasn't like this before a year ago (we graduated in 2008), or he hid it very, very well.	1
People married over 10+ years, how often do you have sex with your spouse?	Sometimes every couple days, sometimes every couple weeks. In our 30's with 6 year old twins so life allows us to do it when we do it.	Been together since we were 15, now 27 with 6 kids. We have sex usually ever day on average. It wasn't always like that can we've been through a lot but lifes better when people get affection and jollies.	1
What was your #1 childhood fear?	Going to hell, my parents going to hell. I was raised Catholic. Needless to say, I no longer consider myself Catholic. I despise the religion now.	I was terrified of toothpaste for the longest time. My brother told me that the reason it made your teeth white was because little elves inside the tube went into your teeth and scrubbed them clean. He also told me that the elves hated cake, and they would take my teeth if I ever ate cake and would turn me into an elf. So there I am eating cake, and an hour later one of my baby teeth fell out, I ran to my parents screaming that the tooth paste elves were stealing my teeth because I ate cake and that i didn't want to become an elf. I didn't eat cake for like 3 years.	0
Girls of Reddit, what are some hints you gave to a crush which flew right over their head (the more obvious, the better)?	I was persuing him HARD. He was making me dinner at his house and we are chatting. He makes a joke about the hoops he'd have to jump through to get a classy woman like me to sleep with him. I respond with "It wouldn't take all of that for you to get me in your bed..." as I flirtatiously grin at him and roll my eyes towards his bedroom. He laughs and responds with "so what do you like on your salad?". Thankfully I didn't give up on that dork and now we are happily living together in the mountains.	I might win from the guys perspective. Hung out with, texted, and had sex with this girl for over a year. Legitimately thought we were just friends. She stopped talked to me out of nowhere lol	1
Why do Americans not care that Nike uses sweatshops/child labor but get pissy when Nike chooses a man who exercised his right to freedom of speech (which is supposedly a big deal in America) as their face?	To be perfectly honest, the people who truly "care" that Nike picked Kap as their rep is a minority. But the dumbest people usually have the biggest mouths so thats all you ever hear.	Why do leftists not care that Nike uses child labor but want to defend it because they desperately wish that whiny loser Colin Kaepernick was relevant or heroic in any way?	1
What was your 'holy shit, this is amazing' moment in gaming?	The ending of Bastion. Carrying Zulf to safety despite what he'd done, his people forgiving me despite what I'd done.	First clear of the Vault of Glass was something special. Too bad they couldn’t bring that feeling back with any of the other raids (including Leviathan)	1
Dentists of Reddit, what is a lesser obvious thing you can tell about patients lifestyle and habits when treating them?	My dentist kept saying, "So, you're diabetic." and "Are you sure you're not diabetic?" A year later... diagnosed with diabetes.	Ex-gf was a dentist. You can tell how good a parent someone is by how fucked up their kids teeth are.	1
What's something rich people will never understand about being poor?	Well, most rich people didn't work for their money, they got it handed down or got it from a business. Poor people or lower class people like me, often work for their money or have a job. While others use welfare to their advantages.	How stressful it can be when you have to bring your car into a shop for repairs. You just know its going to make you go broke	0
Every house has that one drawer, where you say "fuck it" and throw anything in it. Reddit, what is the weirdest object in your "random drawer"?	I remember when my brother and I were kids, he put a slice of Swiss cheese in the junk drawer for unknown reasons. It smelled SOOOOOO bad. Thats the best I got, I don't have a junk drawer now	Why, I have a whole chest of random drawers. So, best item from each of them; Top Drawer - a pocket folding frisbee Second Drawer - some easyjet headphones Third Drawer - Oh my fuck, I just found my driving licence! Bottom Drawer - Dentures that don't belong to me Edit: having found my driving liscence less than half an hour ago, I have now managed to lose it again. Wonderful.	0
What's the MacGyverest thing you've ever done?	Years ago I worked as a nightwatchman at a construction site. And when you work nights all you want to do is sleep on the job. The problem was that the supervisor would come around at random and if he caught me sleeping, I'd be fired. So I came up with a solution. There was only one entrance into the site so I rigged a sort of alarm to wake me up when it opened. I used a battery powered radio, a length of wire, a spring-type clothespin and some screws. The way it worked was that the clothespin would close and make electrical contact when the door opened. This would send battery power through the wire and turn on the radio, waking me up when I needed to. And nobody suspected a thing. I got plenty of sleep on that job.	Cooked a hot dog by cutting off a lamp cord, splitting out the two wires and stripping them, taping each one to a fork, each fork in one end of the hot dog, plug 'er in.	1
What are you not patient with?	Fat apologists. There is literally not a single redeeming feature of being overweight. It is a leading cause of death, and even if you're fortunate enough to not suffer to that extent, your ability to do every day things is severely hindered. Worst of all is, you're probably going to share your bad eating habits with your kids, and fuck them up too. And no, there is not a single shred of scientific evidence that **YOUR** specific metabolism is faster/slower or that a conventional lower calorie diet won't work for you, you should just EAT A LITTLE BIT LESS, CONSISTENTLY.	Tehnology. The moment it doesnt work I go inferno inside. Then I think of that Louis CK bit where the guy is complaining about his phone taking ages to send a text, and he's like "it has to send a message to space and back! Would you give it a bit of time to get back from space?!", which calms me down because then I feel like an idiot.	0
You’re the literal fashion police, working day in and day out to rid the world of bad taste. What do you arrest people for wearing?	Out of place frills. Sometimes I will see the most lovely shirt or dress, but then it will have the most awkward looking frill.	Guys who go shirtless. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. All black. I don't care how lacking of a personality you are, black is a base, not the feature. Post ford gucci. Those weird cannonball cheek studs. Saggy pants. HOW IS THIS STILL A THING 'traditional' tuxedos. They look good, but they've stagnated. Force evolution. Children who dress too sexy/adult. You gotta be a potato before you can be vodka, do your time. Kardashians on principle. Instagram makeup where you smudge dirt on your cheek that only looks good from one angle under filters. There's a lot of fashion I don't like, but it's gotta be pretty fucking bad or unhealthy for my fashion student self to make illegal.	1
What is a job that you wouldn't or couldn't do, but respect and why?	Shout out to janitors for putting up with people's shit. I know it doesn't happen often but the stories I've seen here of people smearing shit on the walls/toilet/floor/mirrors/sink/anywhere, I'd just walk out. So kudos to those who have the stomach to clean it up, knowing that it will likely happen again soon.	I walked round the corner and met, for the first time, Sewer Sucking Man. I'd had no idea he existed. A long truck with a hose coming from it; the other end of the hose went down through a manhole cover to the sewer. Bad, bad stench. But he was brave and true and did not run from it. Why does Sewer Sucking Man have to do this? Doesn't the crap swim down to the sea naturally without his help? What does he do with it, there in his truck barrel, and where does he take it? --I want there to be a holiday to encourage all such men & women who do this. Without them, apparently, our nation's streets would flow with doo doo.	1
What is ruined by adults?	YOUTH SPORTS! I've witnessed too many literal fights at youth sporting events that are 1000% the parents fault, I feel so bad for these kids today	Never reaching out on getting together. I was always the one asking if they were available to hangout. They were always willing to do something and we always had a good time, but after a while it felt like a one way street. Once I stopped with the invites and they just fell off the face of the planet. Every once in a while a Facebook comment "Haven't see you forever! Let's hangout soon", or a big party situation (like a birthday), but that's where it stopped. I've had this happen multiple times in my adulthood... wait, maybe I'm the problem?! No, they suck! That's the problem!	1
Redditors who live extremely near to a time zone split, how does it affect your daily life?	I commute to work across a time zone change. Its an hour drive, but basically it takes me two hours to get to work and zero hours to get home.	This will likely get buried since it is so late, but near where I live in Indiana, there are two small towns: One is on Eastern time and the other is on Central time. The two towns have a joint high school so in those communities you have to specify whether something is town time or school time. Indiana time zones are ridiculous!	1
What are some signs that a person is manipulative?	I dated a guy that didn’t want any of his close friends or connections to be friends with each other. He told me his best friend male friend and best girl friend didn’t like me, and when we broke things off I found out he’d been telling them I didn’t like them (and that they didn’t like each other). He was manipulating us so we couldn’t talk about what a dick he was with each other.	They listen twice as much as they talk. It's easy to manipulate someone with their own words if you pay enough attention to twist them later on.	1
The 35 year-old effect, anyone else feel it?	<~ 31, Female. Understand completely. Although, Im in a bit of a different boat... the 20 somethings all are into PARTY! PARTY! SLEEEEEP SLEEEEP SLEEEEP...which is cool but DOES get old when You have to work everday...and the 30 somethings (and 40 somethings & FUCKING PARENTS) are all on the baby train...WTF? What part of I do not want children do these people NOT Understand? & IF I did, I certainly wouldnt have one, I would adopt one...There are many who need a home, why add a child when there are still children who need homes? (another concept these 30/40 y/o women REFUSE to get) Frustrating @ times.......... I have learned to say Fuck It...and do what makes YOU happy and fuck everyone else. In the end, its only you thats gotta live with you, might as well make you happy. =)	I am 58 yrs old and have been outworking people 1/2 my age for many years. I don't think of my friends as a peer group. ... Rather simply as friends. F*ck it... quit worrying about where you as an individual fit in and start being just yourself.	0
What overlooked fact from a movie will completely change the way I see it?	In Return of the Jedi, it's implied that the Ewoks feast on human flesh when they were going to cook the gang on spits. At the end of the movie, there's certainly more than enough storm trooper filets to go around.....	Beauty and the Beast 1991 If you look at the time line, the rose is going to die during his 21st birthday/year. Lumiere said they been like this for 10 years. So if you do the math, the witch put a spell on a 11 year old. So of course an 11 year old wouldn't let a stranger in his home. Witch was being a bitch	0
What’s a good book that got turned into a terrible movie?	Unpopular Opinion : The Neverending Story and The Princess Bride are both awful pale imitations of the books. Nostalgia aside, those movies suck.	Could probably fill this thread with Stephen King novels, as for some odd reasons therea re only two types of movies based on Kings´stories; Absoloutly fantastic or absoloutly terrible, no middleground as it seems.	0
What foods do you eat in an unconventional way?	With tacos, I'll put a new dab of salsa, pico, sauce (whichever is available) on each new bite instead of just dumping it on the whole thing.	Whenever I eat small things like nuts, m&ms, etc, I eat them two at a time, putting one one each side of my mouth.	0
Reddit, what still makes you cry?	As a coach and youth sports observer. The kid who knows he going to be last but just doesn't quit.	How hard it is to get a decent consistent fuck buddy who you really vibe with. Been frustrated for weeks.	1
Women of Reddit, what are some things a dad should know about raising a girl?	After you wash her hair, if you have to comb it, start at the bottom and work up... don't start at the top and muscle through the knots!	If she turns out to be a he or a they, or not straight, take the time on your own to learn about it. There are more sources of information than your child and they don't want to answer all your questions. Edit: Aight fine. Y'all wanna be transphobic and homophobic that's your business. Just don't let it affect children.	1
What's a random space fact you'd like to share?	The colour of vegetation on other earth-like worlds might not necessarily be green like it is here. In fact, since dim red stars are such common candidates for having planets in the habitable zone - any photosynthesizing lifeforms on said planets might even favour black or other very dark colouration to make the most of whatever light they can get. There could be literal black forests out there!	Due to spaces's vastness and the distance between planets we will never be able to meet extraterrestrial life. You'd need faster than light travel, and nothing with mass can move faster than light so yeah.	1
What's a film that completely and thoroughly delivered on the hype you felt for it?	Dark Knight. Not only did it deliver, it blew away any expectations that I had. Watching on IMAX made it even huger in every sense of the word.	Ready Player One. First movie in years that I've gone back to see again. Expected it to stray from the book so wasn't disappointed when it did.	1
What movie had the best plot twist that really caught you off guard?	backdoor sluts 9 boy did i not see that cummin', totally blew me away and stuck with me til' this day	Silence of the Lambs. [When the police is trying to storm the suspects building and when the suspects opens the door the viewer realizes that the police knocked on the completely wrong house, and suddenly Jodie Foster stands in front of the maniac. Man, that was intense, so brilliant.](/spoiler)	0
What things annoy you that probably shouldn't?	When a car beats me to a stop sign, and then sits there waving me to go. *Fuck you, just follow the fucking rules and go, you won...*	Fat people. If some politician ran on a platform of imprisoning all the fat people in forced labour camps, I would work my ass off for them.	1
Parents of Reddit, what is the worst thing you've done in front of your baby knowing they won't remember?	Not a parent, but I remember watching South Park when I was like 3 and still remember their colorful language. My Asian mother thought it was like a western children's anime.	I once had a 7 way scat orgy that included two midgets and a bunch of sex toys. Once I even looked up and saw my daughter chewing on one of the dildos!	1
Vegans of Reddit, what's your go-to dish for impressing the shit out of non-vegans?	ITT: Meat eaters telling vegans their food isn't good enough simply because there's no meat in it. That's the point, bro.	I'm not vegan, but a lot of South- and Southeast Asian dishes either are vegan or can easily be adapted to be vegan. I've made Thai curries for vegans on multiple occasions, just using tofu instead of chicken (it's little pieces and flavored so strongly that you can't tell the difference) and omitting fish sauce and shrimp paste, to great reviews. If you have a dietary limitation, you're usually better off finding a cuisine that matches rather than trying to make a vegan steak or whatever.	0
What are you addicted to, and what does it cost you?	Alcohol, about £100 a week i guess in the bad old days? Friendships, relationships, braincells, liver and kidney function, memories, two jobs so far, a criminal record, a lot of respect and a fuck load of my time. i'm still drinking but I am at least cutting down, attending programs and noticing I have a problem.	Snus. Basicly its just tobaco with taste That you put under your lip. It's like smoking but doesnt hurt your body, its a great way to stop smoking and still get the nicotine :) It costs about 30-50 SEK (swedish kronor) per can, and it contains around 25 portions in one can.	1
Do you genuinely enjoy the rain, and, if so, why?	No because it fucks up my skateboard and camera. Also having to carry an umbrella around and still getting wet	I just like the calmer atmosphere when it’s raining. It’s more quiet without other people out and about when it’s not raining.	0
[Serious] Reddit, what's currently stressing you out, and how can we help?	That my best friend just died. He was riding a motorcycle and I was following behind him in a car. I was the first person on the scene. I saw his face. I heard him fighting for air through is broken nose and broken neck. I talked to him 6 days a week for the last 5 years whether it be a real conversation or me just sending him a funny link I found here on Reddit. We were supposed to get an apartment together next week. I drove cross country with him. Best memories I have are with him. He wants me to travel and be successful, when he was always the more educated one. Rooting for me when I needed it most. Now he is gone. And I will have to become successful without him. Rest easy Kevin.	No one can help me, but these people can help themselves. A lot of people in my town love to hate the police, but none of them actually know anything of the law. It's really frustrating when ignorant uneducated people think they know what they're talking about, when they really don't. And then they think they can criticize the police, when they have no idea what it is they're talking about. It's really annoying.	1
Redditors who have taken LSD, what was the trip like and how were you afterwards?	I cleaned my apartment top to bottom because I realized I could vastly improve the quality of my life immediately and should do so. Afterwards I was pretty happy with myself.	Scary as shit... I got attacked by a fern. Had a Ministry poster on the wall try to kiss me. When I tried to sleep it off my head repeatedly fell through the pillow. Never again!	1
To anyone who has dated / been married to a twin that has passed away, how does it feel seeing the other twin still alive?	My father is/was a twin. My uncle died when I was 12. They couldn't have been more opposite personality wise but were identical. The only thing that made them different is my dad's beard. He's had it my whole life and people often joke "oh he should totally shave", "that would be totally crazy". Once a few years ago my little sister got pushy and kept pressuring my Dad to cut it all off. My father teared up and said "It's hard enough seeing him in the mirror every day".	It was really hard losing her. She was always so perfect and always knew how to make me feel the way I wanted. The twin is nearly identical but everything about her seems to be lopsides, so it never feels entirely the same when I made the switch. Mary Palmer, you are severely missed but Betty Right is almost as good.	1
Reddit, when were the best times of YOUR life?	When I became one of the biggest male strippers in my country. Had packed out shows everyday. Was the biggest entertainment in my country for a while. Sadly I had a major pole accident and had too retire. People still recognise me as Hot Chocolate when I'm out on the town. Although Hot Chocolate is now only a memory for many, but a memory many will cherish for a lifetime.	When I was dating my ex. I have never experienced that constant feeling of euphoria, like the whole world could burn down but it wouldn't matter because our relationship was the only thing I needed in the world. Sadly it didn't last, but that short span of time was the happiest I have ever been.	0
To anyone who's been to a Reddit meetup: what are they like?	You remember when your friends found out about memes and internet culture? And they would post these awkward half-veiled poor references to some meme, (i.e. gonna COURAGE WOLF my next test CHALLENGE ACCEPTED LOLO!!!!111), and they think they are so funny, edgy, and full of wit, but really those who have no idea what is going on just think they are awkward retards and those who know think they are also idiots? Yeah, I imagine it'd be like that but IRL.	I went to a couple. They were incredibly awkward. Turns out that some people that spend all of their free time on the internet don't always have the best social skills in person. *That said, I have met a lot of people that I became friends with and later found out they were also redditors.	0
What "one weird trick" does a profession ACTUALLY hate?	Most disposal problems can be fixed with a few turns of an allen wrench on the underside of the disposal (it manually fixes jams). Most people seem to not know this and call plumbers instead.	Painter here, not the artistic kind. I challenge any of you to try typing in 'one wierd trick to painting like a pro' and then go tackle painting a room. If you have no painting experience trying to get a clean cut on the ceiling will have you pulling your hair out	1
Gamers of Reddit, what was the longest you've ever been stuck in a part of a game?	Counter Strike. I never beat de_dust2. I'm still stuck on that shit. ^someone ^please ^tell ^me ^how ^to ^get ^de_dust3	Elder Scrolls Online loading screen. Took just over 17 hours to reach the character load screen. I went to bed woke up and continued to wait through it.	0
What is a small, amazing detail you have seen in a movie that no one else seems to notice?	In Dark Knight, right before Alfred gives the whole "some men just want to watch the world burn" speech, Bruce says, "Criminals aren't complicated Alfred, we just need to find out what he wants." These are exact words that Ra's Al Ghul said to him in Batman Begins when he was training with the Leage of Shadows.	In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, when [Snape kills Dumbledore, Dumbledore](/spoiler) falls backward to his death in slow motion just like [Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber did in Die Hard](/spoiler), and of course [Alan Rickman played Snape](/spoiler). I bust out laughing in the theatre when I first saw that scene.	1
Chronically late people of Reddit, what makes being somewhere on time hard for you?	Sometimes I'll just delay getting ready because I'm feeling anxious about wherever I'm headed that day, so I'll procrastinate until the last minute until I'm suddenly rushing to get ready and wind up leaving later than I had initially intended because "the last minute" was actually 30min later than I should have waited. That, or I miss an off ramp or get lost finding the place because I have a horrible sense of direction that even GPS navigation has a hard time salvaging for me. I usually give myself a 30min buffer going to new places - or at least I try to. See above regarding "the last minute".	Time is an illusion. Someone like me is neither late, nor are they early. I arrive precisely when I mean to.	1
What makes your blood boil?	How awful the counselor at my middle school was. I got bullied a lot and the main bully told me to kill myself. Someone reported it and I was called down to her office. The first question she asked was "what did you do to make [person] say that?" She ended up giving me a lecture on how I should respect other people's beliefs and asking if I ever thought I was being "too sensitive." Writing about this still makes me angry even though it's been over 6 years. Everyone in my family (and a few of my friends) who went to that school had similarly awful experiences.	Feminists saying men have more priviledge. Woman have more priviledge to men by a longshot. And the pay gap, it doesn't exist the way it is portrayed	1
What was your school known for?	Some idiots in my high school wanted to delay finals so they set up bombs in a locker on the second floor. Luckily someone noticed the wires sticking out and called the police before they could set them off. The school was evacuated and everyone was detained by the police for like 8 hours while they sorted the whole thing out and tried to find who was responsible. The crazy thing is that they just wanted to do it as a joke and try to keep final exams pushed back a few days but the SWAT team took the bomb to a local mountain to set them off and the explosion was crazy. They said it would've blown up the entire second floor and loss of lives would be tremendous. It made the criminal charges even worse for the group of kids that were caught.	Being the ghetto underdog school, losing *every* single football game for over a decade (not sure why but it was almost *always* 0-66), and having some kid roll up a FAT blunt of spice, dank weed, and salvia. I don't think he even finished it before he walked out of the school and started jumping in front of cars. I think he later died in the hospital to be honest. Or that could have been the next school over, some girl smoked spice and her and her friend died like almost instantly. Sad really :/	1
What's your experience with Sleep Paralysis hallucinations?	When i was in the army i was sleeping in the top bunk when i had Sleep Paralysis, first i hallucinated seeing my buddy come in the room looking for me, approaching the bed and looking at me while his face slowly turned weirdly evil with long teeth, then hands came up from around the bed and started grabbing me. i was awake the hole time with my eyes open but couldn't move or speak. i was trying to scream "wake me up" because there were other people in the room when it happened. eventually they heard me mumbling and woke me up. one of the scariest things that ever happened to me.	I remember being fully conscious but I couldn't open my eyes or move my body. I would start to panic until I could move again. Only happened 5 or 6 times when I was young, thank god it hasn't happened again.	1
What's the most disgusting thing you've ever found in your house?	My wife went to clean a bathroom we don’t normally use to prepare for a guest. She called me in and pointed to a maggot writhing on the toilet seat lid. We lifted the lid and there were more on the seat and about an inch of dead maggots in the bowl. Where did they come from? I looked up and noticed the exhaust fan was right above the toilet. I flipped the switch for the fan and CLING-CLANG-CLING-CLANG maggots start raining down from above. Apparently a bird had died up in the vent and birthed this writhing mass of gray-white stinking devil worms. If the timing had been a little different, our guest could have been sitting on the toilet when...	On my 28th Birthday I woke up to the cat being sick on my shoulder (love you Loki thanks), went downstairs and immediately stood in another pile of cat sick- stumbled, and stood in orange cat diarrhoea. HAPPY BIRTHDAY.	1
What do you remember that 95% of us have forgotten?	The show on Disney Channel around 2000-2001 called So Weird. It was like X-Files for kids. No one I know remembers it and it's not on DVD or anything. I loved that show.	That they world was free compared to today, when companies guzzle your data for profit, and governents have complete access to everyones life through their data. Also whatever stupid situation you get in, youll be filmed, and put on youtube :) and of course you cant say whatever you want because youll be "lynched", either by rednecks or overly sensitive liberals(or whatever else random grouping of likeminded people you might have inadvertedly offended) there is no common sense middleground only shouts of extreme ego's	1
If you could change ONE thing about the United States, what would you change?	The national anthem has to be played by kazoos. It’s illegal and disrespectful now to play the song with any other instruments.	Its president. Even if I don't care about your internal issues, thanks to him you're fucking the planet quite an extra bit, and we don't need that. Nobody needs that.	1
What is your weird habit?	I bite the skin around my fingernails. Most people think I'm biting my fingernail so I don't get looks that are too disgusted. It looks normal except when my hands are wet and then you see skin all over peeling. That's when I get the weird looks.	I like to drink way too much liquor one night, and then spend the next day feeling like shit and hating the world. It's so much fun!	1
Bartenders, what was the most pitiful pick up attempt you witnessed at work?	Bartending girl posting about pick up from a girl.. I've posted in other bartender threads.. Talked about "the whores" before. One of them said, "If you were bi-curious, I'd totally take you home." Just wasn't even a good pick up line at all hahaha.	I bartended for many years in NYC and have seen a plethora of lame pick-up attempts. By far the most sickening was this cheezy yuppie guy who used to work at Cantor and Fitzgerald but left a year before the towers fell. The months following 9/11, he would talk up girls and tell him his sob stories about surviving that day and the friends he lost. That crocodile even managed to bring tears to his eyes. I charged him double until he stopped coming to my bar.	0
What's the biggest bullet you've ever dodged Reddit?	Ah, when I was just a wee lad, walking about over on Yoshi's Island. Everything fine up until I I saw this wee, little dot appear over the horizon. It just kept getting bigger and bigger.. Then I saw that it had eyes! Honest to god! Eyes! Bullet Bill they called it. I knew a man named Bill once.. Didn't like him one bit. 'Course BULLET Bill was still easier to dodge. He left me wallet alone! Sorry.. I couldn't resist.	I've got a double for you. When I was about 7 My sister and I were being driven home by a babysitter. She ran a red light, hitting a car which caused us to spin and hit a traffic light. The traffic light went through the side of the car, behind the passenger seat. If I was sitting there instead of the middle seat, I would've died. Also, after the accident a nice man came up and asked if he could help, my babysitter said "here, these aren't my kids, can you take them home to their mother?" Luckily he was a nice guy but that could've gone really bad. Edit: Typo	0
My girlfriend, whom I love, is going to break up with me over something she thought I did. (I didn't do it.) What can I tell her to make her believe me?	So what if you talked to her? Your girlfriend needs to get over it either way. You probably can't convince your girlfriend. 1. She sounds irrational and irrationally jealous. 2. You are telling her the same story a liar would tell if he didn't want to get caught, which unfortunately doesn't leave you many options. Tell her all she can do is either believe you and get over it or break up with you and that you don't feel the need to make her believe you because you know you can't.	You don't "make" her believe you. You tell her the truth and let her make her own decisions. You need to realize that, by telling the truth, you don't lose either way here, whether she believes you or not.	0
(NSFW) Has there ever been a time when you really and truly thought you were going to die?	When I was 15 I had appendicitis. The doctor said that if we had waited for 2 more hours I'd be dead. Some of the worst pain I've ever had.	I had a really horrible migraine or seizure, I don't know, ended up driving off the road. Luckily, I was able to drive off without a scratch, just a hole in my tire. But that was amazing. God was definitely on my side!	1
What should be considered bad manners these days, but generally isn't?	Happens all the time but when you're with a friend and they run into someone they know, they're supposed to introduce you so you're not just awkwardly standing there while they chat for 5 minutes. Also if you're in a group and people are talking about an inside joke for more than 10 seconds you're supposed to let everyone in on the joke so they aren't just sitting there awkwardly.	If you live in an apartment complex or any kind of duplex: starting stuff before noon EDIT - during the weekends. Seriously! Don't start drilling your wall before noon. People are still waking up at best. Don't start cutting the grass. Your lawnmower's loud and everybody's still asleep. Turn the music down for fuck sakes, it's not yet noon and people are sleeping. Applies to moms as well.	1
Veterans of reddit that play military games and FPS games. What do they get right and what do they get wrong? And what individual game or series would you say is the closest to reality or most accurate?	The sounds are pretty realistic. The biggest thing they get wrong is the speed and accuracy. You you are shooting and moving, you need to do it at a slow walk, and your shots will only be accurate up to a few meters. Also, IRL, a lot of planning and practice takes place to make sure you don't shoot in someone else's direction because you don't want any friendly fire. In an FPS game, you never think about this	Reloading is always super fast in a video game, and you never lose the rounds in your magazine. During a firefight, if you have 15/30 rounds left in your magazine, you will most likely not reload it. You only carry 7 mags, and want to conserve them	1
My wife just said "that'll do pig" to a complete stranger who helped us. In what ways have YOU been completely embarrassed by someone you're with?	my mom called the dude at meijier who helped put bags in out car a "gentleman and a scholar". This guy was far far from that.	This story isn't from someone who was with me, but it's worth telling. My aunt was with her husband and two daughters at a restaurant, the latter of whom were aged around 11 and 9 at the time. The kids are being rowdy and not listening to their parents' orders for them to control themselves, and my aunt finally says, "If you two don't stop right now, I'm going to do something that will make you very, very embarrassed." They don't stop. She then removes her shirt and starts twirling it above her head like a lasso, standing there in her bra, making very conspicuous cheering noises. End result: unimpressed husband, mortified daughters.	0
What did kids used to do in cars on road trips before DVD players and cell phones?	Pretend that they were running along side the car jumping and dodging, sometimes flying. Game boys. Walkman (tape) players. Generic Hand held games. Read books. Talk to the other people in the car. "I spy with my little eye something boring", that old gem of a game. "I see a punch buggy" "Ow" "Ow!" "Two for flinching" Try to murder your step brother. "Behave or I'll turn this car around." "I'm not touching you, I'm not touching you..."	I find this question amazing. And a sign of how addicted to technology parents are allowing their kids to become. IMHO it's really Fucking Sad.	1
What did you look forward to doing as an adult that turned out to be pretty lame?	Not exactly an adult, but... At the park near my house there was a piece of play equipment named the 'TeenRager'. It was basically like snow/skate/wake board which you stand on with plastic coated chains at each end attached to the structure at each side. Above were some bars to hold onto. Basically the idea was that you hold onto the bars above your head and swing backwards and forwards on this board, simulating...well, something. It must have taken 4-5 years for me to be tall enough to use this piece of equipment, which as a kid seemed like forever. Turns out it actually sucks and isn't fun.	Being able to stay up past 9. Don't get me wrong, I love taking shots until the wee hours or marathoning Netflix all night but when you need to get up at 5:30 every morning for work you start to wish you could go to bed *before* the kids.	0
What's your, caught in a NSFW situation, at work?	I’m a landscaper and the other day, I couldn’t get the image of Will Smith as the genie out of my head...the thought of that blue skin was unbearable. I couldn’t wait until I got to the theater. Then it hit me, I could prebate and edge on the job until I got to the screening. It was exhilarating...I was pretending that my manhood was the lamp and I couldn’t wait to get the “genie out the bottle.” My vice-like death grip made it turn blue and that just bout put me over the edge. Unfortunately, the homeowner caught me and she had been recording me. It was kind of embarrassing but it didn’t stop me from swinging by the theater after!	I used to work in a call center for a major satellite TV provider. Other than the usual perv that would call to be gross, we had one dude who would call and just make us read off porno titles: "What do yall have?" "Backdoor sluts 9, busty blondes 2, etc" All the while he would just beat his meat to ladies reading the names of dirty movies.... Edit: thanks for the silver, friend!	0
What are some signs that a TV show is running out of ideas?	When even the most unfuckable characters in the cast end up in a romance of some sort, just for fan service to the female fans.	When old villains keep coming back again and again, to a point where they no longer seem threatening. Looking at you, Supernatural.	0
Every country is a high school student and it's prom night. Who is going to the prom with whom?	New Zealand and Australia try to find dates besides each other, can't and reluctantly go together at the last minute and then fight all night.	USA has to go with his cousin Canada because he is too racist to go with anyone else and she is too shy to get a date but everyone thinks she is nice.	1
What is something a teacher did that still makes you angry to this day?	In high school, I made unintentional eye contact with another student during a test for all of two seconds and the teacher stormed over, accused me of cheating, and took my test. Later found out that she had been applying for a job that my dad ended up getting, so she was taking that out on me.	I'm currently in 7th grade. My boyfriend's (I'm a dude) Geography teacher is a person who many do not like. I am fortunate enough to not have his class. One day, I walked Aiden (my boyfriend) into this geography teacher's class. I was holding his hands and as we were about to say goodbye, the teacher snapped toward us, sneered, laughed for a second and with the most mean and most serious face I have ever seen. He then said, "Please leave Aiden and stop blinding students with your radiating fagness." I was BULLSHIT. I went immeadietly to the school administrator. Told him everything, and nothing came from it. Went back into the Geography teacher's class, told him to stop being a homophobic asshole, and bitchslapped him across the face. Two-Day suspension, the teacher still doesn't get fired. I left that school for good.	1
What is the most awkward moment you've ever had to endure?	I answered the phone with "who died?" when I received a call from someone who doesn't make phone calls very much. Her friend Amanda, as it turned out.	this one is pretty fuckin bad.... So, we had a nice date. Dinner, a movie, and some ice cream afterwards. dat dairy inn doe ;) so, we make it back so I can get into heavy petting. We're making out, getting hot and heavy and she starts giving me a blowjob. she likes it a little rough so i oblige. MOMENTS LATER SHE THROWS UP FUCKIGN VANILLA ICE CREAM ALL OVER ME. ON MY SWORD UNSHEATHED. That was an akward next couple of minutes.	1
What's the coolest thing you can buy for $25 or less?	I used to play this one MMO that cost like $15 bucks a month. Great game really. I don't really think about it anymore or at all really. I used to a lot. Even had dreams about it. Anyways totally worth it.	The scar above my left eye is from my brother's hockey slapshot back-swing. The scar below my left eye is from my brother's plastic golf club back-swing. I don't stand behind my brother anymore.	1
Bring out your throwaway accounts, folks. What is the most humiliating fact about yourself?	THAT I REALLY LOVE MY CAT. THE CAT IS NOT VERY CUTE. BUT IT CAN DO FUNNY TRICKS AND IS REALLY NICE TO EVERYONE IT MEETS AND GREETS.	As a kid I would try and keep from shitting as long as possible, usually with disastrous results. Sometimes i'd just let the shit sit in my tighty whiteys until it hardened enough to be easily removed. I took tae kwon do at the time and would manage to drop tiny hardened pieces of turd out of my pants while at lessons in the corner of the dojo, kind of like Andy Dufresne and his wall. I used to think no one noticed, but i'm pretty sure they did... Sorry Master Chun	0
Redditors in their 30s and over, what advice do you have for redditors in their 20s?	Having kids really is the most satisfying, fun and rewarding thing you can do in life. Your kid will make your heart explode with joy over and over again. But don’t do it until you have travelled, drank, partied, done irresponsible things, found out who you are and generally had a lifetime worth of fun first.	In order to create the life you want, get away from anyone or any situation that is negative. Like now.	0
What's the worst job you've ever had?	Hotel housekeeping. If it comes out of the human body, I've cleaned it up. I started in a by-the-hour motel when I was 14, owned by a woman who didn't bother with hazardous waste procedure and cleaned up what looked like a murder scene with nothing but bleach and kitchen gloves. I walked into that room, and was absolutely positive that when I pulled the shower curtain open there was going to be a body in the bathtub. Thankfully there wasn't, just blood everywhere. Owner refused to let me report it, made me clean it, and I didn't want to get in shit for bleaching a murder scene at 14 so I never did call the cops.	worst job I ever have was milking cow dla wujek Wojciech on famous polish farm for kommunist. It were very bad job but milk was dobre.	1
Reddit, what was your worst gift you have ever gotten?	Ex-girlfriend. Gave me half a ticket (I had to pay the other half). To weezer. After weezer was very bad. And she came with me.	One year for my birthday my dad gave me a rented movie. It had to be back the next day	0
Office workers of Reddit, why do you hate that one co-worker so much? What does he/she do?	I don't hate office workers. I hate out of control MODS from Reddit that ban people from subreddit (Especially like world news) when you know... people might have different opinions about what's right and what's wrong. SO,... Forget the idea of Office workers of REddit let's focus on actual office workers of REddit, Why are your MODS a bunch of pussies ?	She has the thermostat in her office. She opens her window because it gets too hot. The cool air makes the thermostat think it needs to produce more heat, and roasts the rest of the office. I've talked to her about it multiple times and she does not understand the concept for some reason.	0
What movie or story makes you wonder, what happens to the characters after the end credits?	I'm just going to say it... Gilmore Girls. They just did the 'Year in the Life' episodes on Netflix, and it ends with a big revelation. And to my knowledge they're not making any more episodes. Unless it's just a ruse to make more series.	The Truman Show. Who is the first person he sees outside the door at the top of that set of stairs? A security guard? A production assistant? A gaffer? What does he say to them? What do they say to him?	0
Teenage boys/girls at girls only/boys only schools, what is something that mixed school students wouldn't experience?	Cheerleading squad without a football team. Dances with "brother" high schools. I think we had one men's bathroom for every 4 women's bathrooms.	I'm going to be honest, I clicked this for hot all girl action stories (over 18,hi Chris). I'm disappointed, not even a pyjama pillow fight.	1
What are some nonweird ways for a guy to meet girls in person?	I started volunteering. Find something you believe in and think is important and go there to volunteer for once a week or so. You’re guaranteed to find other people who have similar values and some of them might be a similar age and some of them might be interesting.	Don’t do something “to meet girls” unless romantic exploration is the purpose of the activity (couples date/single mingle/etc). I can’t speak for all ladies, but I am so sick of not being able to do anything enriching without some fuck trying to get his dick wet out of it. If your goal is to meet someone - either for a hookup or a long-term relationship - pursue it with integrity. You will be much more likely to encounter women with the same mindset.	1
[Serious] Professors, what is the most simple thing students do which grants them your respect or annoys you to death?	Respect: Short emails that get to the point quickly. Annoyance: rambling emails that take a thousand words to explain that they can't write their essay because their dog is sick.	Telling me about how things work in the real world. A. You're 19. You don't know shit about the real world. B. I'm making 6 figures in a tenured position. Tell me I don't understand how the real world works, because it feels like I'm doing pretty well. C. My wife is in the private sector, and there are way more shenanigans and incompetence in a department at a large corporation than my department.	1
People who have jobs where you go inside homes, what's the worst thing you've seen?	Heating company person here. We went into a home to install a new furnace, but turns out he needed a new heat run put into the bathroom upstairs. I should also mention that the dude has been without running water, electric and gas for about 2 years. Guess what we found piled up all over the bathroom floor? I honestly don't know how he was living there, but we called some people to get him the help he needed. (It was poop.)	Gov welfare waste, fraud and abuse. These families were on welfare to the max and yet had way way nicer stuff (everything) than I did. This home service I provided through the state was my part time business on top of my 15 year IT job. I was working extra to pay off bills and debt only to see my hard earned money and taxes getting squandered right in front of my eyes on a daily basis. This was over 12 years covering Bush and Obama. First hand account, you can't tell me it wasn't happening, I was there and stood in their living rooms.	1
So reddit, I've taught my parrot to say "Help, I'm trapped in a parrot!" What should I teach it to say next?	These in order: * Oompa loompa doopity dick * In a vagina it will not stick * Oompa loompa doopity dap * With your hand you shall continue to fap * What ever happens when your lotion runs out? * Blisters and scabbing on your hog snout * What do you do when your dick has turned orange? * You- oh wait, orange. Fuck.	I had a friend who had a parrot and loved Star Trek (the original series). The parrot would mimic the sound of the doors opening on the Enterprise. Once, when we gave it some fruit, it picked it up in its beak, dropped it, and gave us the hairy eyeball saying "It's dead, Jim."	0
What are some tips you can give to an anxious person to help minimise anxiety?	I always try to dress well, if I feel better outside it can help inside. My therapist always used to call this using lipstick. Also in a specifically anxious setting, I like to ground myself. Find 5 things you can see. 4 things you can hear. 3 things you can touch. 2 things you can smell. 1 thing you can taste.	Work out, study, and work hard. Build self confidence in all facets of life and watch your anxiety go away	1
What's a film that is hated by critics that you absolutely love?	Star Wars. The original, the one with Luke and Obi-Wan? Yeah, when it came out it was pretty much universally panned by the critics for being uninspired rehashing.	When I was growing up I just assumed that everyone regarded the 1988 Ron Howard/Lucasfilm fantasy film Willow to be this classic of adventure cinema in the same iconic category as the likes of Back to the Future, The Princess Bride, Jurassic Park and the Star Wars and Indiana Jones trilogies. It sure was to me; watched it a hundred times, loved it loved it loved it. It wasn't until wayyy later - like, until I read the film's Wikipedia entry in like college or something - that I was utterly gobsmacked to learn that it was generally a poorly regarded film that got bad reviews in its day. I couldn't believe it. This shit was the Citizen Kane of fantasy movies to me.	0
What was your "Why are you booing me? I'm right" moment?	I remember being in art class and I was using pink marker to color a comic. A few of the kids around me looked at me like I was doing something illegal until one said "why are you using pink? That's a girl color". I retorted something along the lines of "there are no gender specific colors and if you believe that, you're dumb". After that, they disassociated themselves with me. Glad my parents tought me to live in society, but not everything in society has to live in you.	In kindergarten I drew a picture of grapes and colored them green and the other kids AND the teacher/caretaker were saying there are no green grapes, only purple	0
Non-French redditors, what is something you would like to know about France and ask to a French redditor ?	How different is Paris to the rest of the country? I've been to Paris twice, where should I go next time I visit France?	Why are like 90% of you that interact with Americans so rude? Edit:im talking about French people coming to America not the other way around and online interaction	1
Found out my girlfriend has been cheating on me for the last 2 months, I've honestly never felt this low in my life, how do people deal with these kind of feelings?	1. Lawer the fuck up 2. Hit the gym 3. Delete Facebook First one is optional, although as your attorney, I advise you to do #1.	The fact you're angry is good. It shows you still have self-esteem. And it's good that you,re cutting all contacts with her. Avoid her at all costs.	0
[Serious] People who were diagnosed with a mental illness later in life - at what point did you realize that you were different from most of the people around you and how has the diagnosis affected your life?	I don't know if I have any real disorder, but I lose my attention to things so damn fast. I never do homework because I write 5 words then get sidetracked. I also HAVE to fidget with something or I die, once I went into the bathroom without my iPod, wiped and got it, then continued my shit while playing games or whatever I was doing. The thin is, I can't stop myself. I fold and tear papers that are in my hands if I forget about them, lost 2% because I tore a test up mid class. I looked at the clock and started timing the second hand and I was trying to see if I could notice the minute hand move. I looked down and I had shredded my paper. Failed the test. Anyone know if I have a problem? Or am I just stupid?	Turns out it's actually not normal to be nervous whenever you have to go outside. And writing that out makes me sound so freakin basement-dwelly it's hilarious.	0
I learned a girl at work has been faking cancer the past 6 months. As a cancer survivor, I seriously want to murder her. FUCK THAT GIRL. What fucked up lies have you found out?	A girl at my school told everyone she was adopted as a baby but was abused by her adoptive parents so her biological parents took custody back. I met her mom and asked her what it was like for them to go through that. They gave me a really confused look and told me she had lived with them her whole life.	Maybe you should murder her, or you know, infect her with aids somehow. OR get her addicted to heroin. You'll need some heroin.	1
What was your biggest "Fuck OP" moment on reddit?	There's a user who reposts top posts and gets to the front page a lot, just so he can post spoilers to popular TV shows in the comments.	Somebody posted an image in /r/pics of a Marine curled up with his working dog on deployment. Guys trying to get some sleep in some shithole compound in Afghanistan. These fuckwads were posting comments like: "Hope it makes him feel better about killing children," or how "it looks like he's fucking the dog." Fuck them. Fuck those assholes.	1
People who grow their own herbs, what do you do with your extra thyme?	Who said they had extra or that gardening somehow garners extra time? In fact, growing ones own herbs would mean less spare time. loser.	I keep my herb garden on a long hanging shelf outside of my apartment on the balcony. There is enough space for two rows. The rosemary, dill, and parsley are all planted on the outside, furthest from the apartment. Thyme is on my side.	0
What's the smoothest way you've diffused an awkward situation?	My friend got drunk and punched the manager/bouncer of the bar in the face, then goes after the cop outside. She ends up on the ground in handcuffs. I flirted with the cop and convinced him to release her. The manager decided not to press charges.	When I was in my mid twenties I did consulting work in Manhattan with a bunch of guys of similar ages. Every Thursday we would go out drinking with our bosses (who were probably early thirties) on the company tab. One time about twenty of us were in a crowded bar and these two guys next to us kept bumping into my boss hard. He ignored the first couple times and bummed a cigarette from me. They slammed into him again and he yelled at them, they started jawing back and forth, etc. I wasn't really paying attention but saw my boss with the unlit cigarette in his mouth kind of staring down the guy. Without really thinking I leaned in to light the cigarette and it finally dawned on the strangers that there were twenty of us and two of them. Suddenly they became very apologetic.	0
Girls, what are the most outrageously misogynistic things you have witnessed on Reddit?	I posted in a waitstaff subreddit about a shift where I had a guest grab my ass while I was on the floor. I also touched upon how uncomfortable it is to have people you're serving stare at your chest while you're taking an order in a fine dining establishment. In response, I had multiple people respond and tell me I should be flattered by men gawking and I should probably post a picture of my tits for the public to judge. "Lots of girls are flattered by the attention, why are you complaining blah blah blah". And then someone PM'd me saying they'd come to my restaurant and rape me so there's that. I'm sure posting in this thread will bring some ugliness out of the woodwork.	Well, for starters, you just addressed us as "girls". EDIT: To be clear, I'm not "triggered" or whatever. I'm not personally offended, because I realize that most people don't yet realize that calling women "girls" is infantalizing. But the irony was just so beautifully apparent that I had to point it out. Downvote away, it just confirms that you're part of the problem.	1
Straight people of Reddit, what questions do have for LGBT+ Redditors?	Ok answer me this. I don't really consider myself gay but man do I like looking at dick. Like I really like it but the rest of the male body is kinda meh to me. Women on the other hand I love everything about. Am I in denial?	None at all. Feel free to do what you please in the privacy of your own home. No one really cares.	1
Car rental staff, what is your returned vehicle horror story?	Not a car rental staff but hanging out with a friend who's about to leave on a long as road trip. We hear some racket outside and there's some random chick going all /r/publicfreakout on some dude car with a baseball bat. Busted off the mirrors, broke out all the windows, taillights and headlights, dents, the works. Fast forward about three hours and I'm driving my friend to the rental place so she can pick up a rental for her road trip and guess which car is also in the lot? Turns out, the guy who's car got all fucked up had just rented it to break up with his girl because he knew it wasn't going to go well and didn't want her to fuck up his car. He got all the insurance and she got a felony vandalism charge.	I love renting cars. It's probably my favorite thing about traveling. I love driving and not having to worry about maintaining or babying the car. Wife and I took the long way from Cape Coral through the Everglades to key west. That poor Ford Focus Hatch. Great car though. Zippy little bastard.	1
[NSFW] In hindsight, what’s your most embarrassing sex moment?	Preparing for anal with an ex-bf. I had done it many times successfully in the past and felt pretty confident about it. He lifted up my legs and asked, "Ready?" I said, "Ready as I'll ever be," and then let out the biggest, longest fart in world history. The farting wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for my verbal response just moments before my sphincter decided to start singing. From then on, anytime I said "ready?" in casual conversations like getting in the car, he would always say, "Ready as I'll ever be!"	First time I ever tried doggy style coincided with the first time is encountered a queef. New girlfriend and I are going at it and I pull out to switch positions, forcing her to queef. This is normal enough now that I know what’s what, but I thought she’d let out a fart, gave a squawk of surprise, and fell backwards off the bed. Took me 10-15 minutes to talk her out of the bathroom after she fled there in embarrassment.	1
What jobs do we not appreciate enough, let alone notice?	Aged care nurses. Not only do they deal with some disgusting tasks, they have the respect and compassion to give care to those at end stages in their life.	The phrase "let alone" is used for the more extreme case... so.... What jobs do we not notice, let alone appreciate enough? Or What jobs do we not appreciate enough, or even notice? We don't appreciate enough how good grammar lets you express your ideas clearly so that you can communicate with other people. Poor grammar distracts from whatever you're really trying to get done.	1
Psychiatrists of Reddit, has working with a depressed client ever taken a negative toll on your life? If so, how?	Yes It has. This happened about 2 years ago. There was this one guy who I won't name, who had a really bad dad. He would just come in some times and just say what his day was like, how life at home is going, how life in general. Some times he would talk about everything. Then one day he told me that his dad had done somthing terrible, and when I asked him About it he said his dad beat him with jumper cables	Was going to become a psychiatrist but after dealing with multiple teen "suicide pacts" that we could not seem to stop, chickened out and went with family medicine. About half of my day is spent dealing with patients' psychiatric disorders. Draining but rewarding. If it was my whole day, I would not be able to handle it. Always grateful there are docs/NPs that are made of tougher stuff than me.	0
What's the best way to call the admin's attention to abusive mods?	I (and many others) are banned from posting there after we pointed some of their assholishness out. IMO best thing to do would be raise awareness (like this post!) of the problem, and heavily promote **/r/ainbow** as the safe alternative, since I doubt the admins are willing to interfere in subreddit politics :)	Look. Admins don't give a shit what mods do. A subreddit is the mod's domain. Whatever they do is OK, because it is their subdomain. If they want to ban every non-redhead over the height of 5'2" who doesn't like Justin Timberlake, it's their call. If you don't like the mod's behavior, then the subreddit isn't for you. The admins have said the same thing over and over and over again. Reddit is a platform through which you can build communities as you see fit. The admins administer the platform, not the communities. The kiddie porn thing was a break from their usual hands off approach, and a good one. Don't think, however, that they are going to start stepping in to regulate mods. They won't.	1
How did your parents scare you as a child?	My parents participated in group child abuse with hundreds of other parents in our community. They all taught us that there was a magical man in the sky who watched our every move (NB: a different magic watcher than Santa) and judged us based upon an impossibly complicated list of criteria. We were told that if we didn't meet the criteria that we would live forever while being tortured in fire. The most terrifying part was that all the adults seemed to believe the story as well. It led many of us to have difficulty fully realizing our capacity for critical thinking.	My parents are fundies and would talk all the time about how the government was going to storm our houses and put guns to our heads and kill us for going to church. I started to cry and they chastised me, saying I should rejoice. I was 5 years old.....I have almost nothing to do with them now.	0
I just woke up and realized what Santa Baby's "Hurry down the chimney" line meant. What's the longest time it's taken you to get a sexual innuendo?	Not a sexual innuendo, but did you all know "Wonderful Tonight" was about a man in a wheelchair? It's right there in the song. She puts him to bed, everyone turns and looks at him when they walk in the room. Yup. EDIT: Oh crap. Now everyone thinks I'm the round-headed idiot. I would have thought reddit, of all places, would get that reference. :(	When I was little I didn't realize "I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus" was supposed to be the dad. I just thought that the mom was wrong for cheating on her husband.	0
What is your family's darkest secret?	My great-grandaunt (great-grandmothers sister) had a son out of wedlock with a guy who was married. A couple years later when she got married herself, the new husband told her he didn't want the other man's child and wouldn't let the son live in the house. They abandoned the kid on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere, no-one ever heard from him again.	Dark family secrets should remain that....secrets. If you tell everyone about them then they are not secrets.... In today's world there are too little secrets...	1
Do you recall the loss of your virginity as awesome...or awful?	This is like asking school-children what it felt like to pay their final mortgage installment. I think you should take this question elsewhere.	There were two attempts the first time I had sex. * 1st Time: Finished before I got in * 2nd Time (5 minutes later, thanks internet): Went pretty well for about 15 minutes, until she started complaining about severe pains in her lower abdomen. I took her home early, and later that night, she had to go to the hospital. I ruptured an ovarian cyst she had, which emptied half her blood supply into her body cavity. She had to have emergency surgery, was in the hospital for 3 days, and bedridden for about 2 weeks. Definitely did not expect that. TL; DR: I sent my girlfriend to the hospital our first time.	0
When you were a teenager, who did you suspect was trying to have sex with you?	Its amazing how when you graduate high school, you find out that 15 different girls had crushes on you and never said a word to you.	I was a girl. I was petite, athletic and cute. Pretty easy to figure out that there were lots and lots of boys interested.	1
People who didn't grow up poor, but dated someone who was. What's something your SO does that strikes you as unusual?	I was surprised How open they were about their financial problems. My family never speaks of their riches. When I was a kid, I also thought everyone had a million dollar yacht... apprently not	I didn't date them, but I have a friend who I sit with at lunch that will eat literally anything on my lunch tray that I *don't* eat. Little things like the tomatoe I take out of my salad, or the slice of cheese off a ham and cheese sandwhich, or if I leave a little bit of juice in my carton, she'll finish it off every time without fail. I never think it's a huge deal, because I do eat most of my food, but she flips out like I'm wasting an entire meal.	0
What's the grossest thing you've ever done?	Throwaway. One day I went to go take a shit, wiped, checked the paper to see if I needed to wipe again, and noticed a little clear-ish looking bean-shaped object. Which apparently had come out of my ass. Now I have no idea why I did this, but I used my tissue covered hand to gently squeeze this ass jewel, and the fucking thing popped and sprayed putrid liquid into my eye. I still have no idea what the hell I shat out, and I don't really want to investigate. Ugh.	skydiving Edit: i misread grossest for greatest. I was confused why all the other comments made me forcefully swallow my own vomit	1
What fact do you know that isn't common knowledge?	A goldfish bowl is a terrible environment in which to keep a goldfish. The natural lifespan of a goldfish is years, not weeks. These two facts are related.	95% of the time, the reason your medical claim was rejected, is because your doctor or the billing office made a mistake.	0
Men and Women - What is the "sluttiest" thing you have ever done?	slept with all friends exes. sometimes all in the same week or day. not ashamed.had to much fun. i didnt mind being used as a easy rebound.	I ate a girl's pussy because she lived across the street from the bar and I didn't feel like walking home.	0
Why do you answer questions on AskReddit?	Sometimes in an genuine attempt to help or inform people. But, most most of the time it's to make people laugh. Titty sprinkles.	It's like being part of a huge conversation with strangers. But without having to sit through the horror of literally talking to strangers.	0
Girlfriend wants to visit male-friend (who I don't know) at his Uni and sleep in his bedroom, opinions?	Plain and simple-tell her 'no' and 'it's not appropriate.' let her get bitchy...but show her you **refuse** to be friendzoned. she will fuck you like a mother, because it is sexy to be a strong man but ...it's your choice to be a pushover or a stud	There is a metaphor for this situation. If you love something set it free. If it comes back then it's yours to keep. If it doesn't then hunt it down and kill it. Something like that.	0
[Serious]Redditors who have slept with their step sibling - whats your story?	Long story short, my step-sister hated my bio mom She started having sex with me when she was 17 and I was 15 When she turned 18 and moved out, she dropped the bomb that she's been fucking her son as a huge fuck you She did admit that she liked the sex	We were both 18 and horny No interesting story really, turns out that humans just have a strong instinct to just fuck each other, especially when you spend lots of time together.	0
What's the worst drug experience you have had with someone?	I went to a party with my cousins and brother. Its was all good and chill just drinking Then my brother brought out the weed. My two cousins who were both girls and I have never done weed. So we were nervous and took some convincing but we eventually gave. I felt funny at first thwn it started getting crazy. The next morning I wake up in bed with both of my cousins. We were freaking out for like 2days and too make things even worse jessica my cousin thinks she's pregnant because she's late. I'm 18and jessica and claire are both 16. Plz reddit help me we don't know what to do	my old flatmate wanted to go and pick some magic mushrooms, but I couldn't be bothered that day. he went by himself, came back with a plastic bag full, brewed them up and we drank the tea. shat water for two weeks, he picked the wrong kind of mushrooms.	0
Reddit members in Hawaii what initially went through your mind when you first heard the false ballistic missle warning?	I closed my windows, then checked the Civil Defense website and news. When I didn't hear the sirens go off, I realized it was fake and probably just an escalating attempt from the administration to keep us scared and obedient.	Well I slept through the alarm. I woke up to the alert that it was a false alarm. Next time when it’s real maybe I’ll sleep right through the whole thing and never know what happened!	0
Reddit, what’s a killer first date idea?	I've heard that mountaineering with bare minimum equipment makes for quite the memorable first date. Especially during the winter, when the excitement is augmented by icy winds and enshrouding darkness.	Never, ever, talk fucking politics. I made this mistake assume she was liberal. What followed was her explaining that women should be in the kitchen, weed is the devils lettuce, abortion is murder, immigrants are unwelcome leeches, and the whole nine yards. Looking back now, maybe it was good we talked politics. I missed a bullet there.	1
If each subreddit were a tribe, which would be the most uncivilized and what would their customs be?	/r/ooer would be the least civilized. Its customs would consist of.... um...... well..... I have no clue what they would be.	/r/MensRights would be a bunch of sweaty, overweight and/or ugly men bitching about how the other tribes don't want to talk to them. Every week they would get together to circle jerk and talk about how women are oppressing them, even tho there are no women in their tribe.	1
What is the worst advice you've ever received?	This wasn't me personally but my mom told me that we had a neighbor that used to constantly tell my dad that life insurance was a waste of money and tried to convince him to stop paying for it. Fortunately my dad was intelligent because he died five years later and my family would have been completely destroyed without it.	"Be friends with a girl first before you try to date her." Infinite friend zone status if I had followed this advice.	1
Reddit, what are some things you agree to do with your SO, even though you detest doing them?	Nothing. If I don't like something he does it without me, and if he doesn't like something I do it without him. Why does everyone here think its healthy to be forced to do things you don't like with the other person like you're attached at the hip.	HGTV. I hate all shows about home improvement (except Home Improvement) and have no interest in "house hunting" in another country. Its never about gardens so the whole thing confuses me. She refuses to watch The Walking Dead because she thinks it is stupid. I think she is stupid and a giant butt hole.	0
What is your deepest suspicion about Reddit that you can't actually prove?	I think reddit platform is purposely made to turn people into liberals as poorer areas get more access to Internet So in essence Reddit is the ultimate communist machine	The "circlejerk" is the most effective propaganda technique ever created. All it takes is a few bots to write the first few comments on a post and get them upvoted for the entire comment section to follow them. When people who have no previous opinions click into the post to learn more, they learn exactly whatever the bot-owner wanted them to. What's worse is that it only takes a little spark, and then users will propagate the information on their own.	0
What eventually worked for you while trying to impress your SO?	My own car, my own apartment, a great sales job. Lift 3x a week. That sold her. 3 kids later, she's as hooked as ever.	I actually think this might be the best advice I've ever read on the subject: “Never, ever try to impress somebody. Be exactly the person you would be if you were alone or with somebody it was safe to fart around. Be that person. Be the person you are right now, alone, reading this book. And then meet people. Then hold out until you meet somebody who is utterly impressed. Because then? You will not have impressed them. They will have been impressed by you.” - Augusten Burroughs	0
At a wedding last night a bridesmaid rambled on into a 15 minute speech about her own bi-polar disorder and eventually had to be awkwardly stopped. What's the most painful wedding speech/incident you've ever witnessed?	My wife's aunt was wasted at my sister in law's wedding and began a toast talking about the bride and her husband. After about 20 seconds she started talking about her dead parents and her failed relationships. She later tried (awkwardly) to have a friend of the groom dance and dip her which resulted in him dropping her on the floor and walking away while she rolled on the floor showing her sequin underwear.	This is funny because I was actually the best man at my buddy's wedding last night. The toast I gave was painful for me because I was so nervous but people generally said I did a good job and a president and CEO of a company gave me his card afterwards and told me to send him my resume. So all and all, not too shabby	1
I accidentally made a dead rat ejaculate today. What's the grossest thing that you've ever done, or has happened to you?	Two shit related incidents. I was sleeping over a friend's house. The dog had diahrea and piled it right in the middle of the dinning room. I stepped on it when I was stepping out for a few minutes. thank god I had shoes on, it burned a hole in the carpet. I should have turned on the lights... I kicked my cat in the butt yesterday to get him out of the way...shit smeared across my foot..fucking nasty (first time that has happened...)	I had a morbidly obese man in an advanced state of decomp (read: bloated and greenish purple) explode on me during an autopsy when we made the initial Y incision. Rotting gore on the ceiling dripping down. He was leaking liquid fat all over the floor, damn near slipped on it a few times.	0
What's the worst thing that ever happened on your birthday?	On my 21st birthday I was nearing the end of a 10 hour shift when my parents called. I was glad they hadn’t forgotten, with the time difference I knew they were going to bed soon so I was wondering if they remembered. I answered, expecting happy birthdays but they told me my grandfather died. I smoked another cigarette and went back to work, and had to stay another 4 hours before I could go home. I got home and was ready to just sleep for days and not talk to anybody, but my girlfriend (with the best intentions of course) had planned a surprise party with a bunch of people I knew from school and work, but weren’t my friends. They hung out pretty late so I didn’t get to sleep much before working early again the next day.	Donald Trump got elected on my birthday I understand the US elections are on the same day of the year every season, if that's true then throw in every election/reelection since 1996	1
Dear Reddit, what is your ultimate NSFW life hack?	~~After the third no, it's just role playing~~ Edit: Welp that joke is officially a no go *scratches it off list*	If you wake up and you feel like you can't be bothered to shower (but you know you need one), and you have important things to do that day that you have to get up for, masturbate all over your chest. You'll definitely have to shower after that.	0
What book should be turned into a movie and who should it be directed by?	I want to see a legit Frankenstein. I want an ugly fellow who speaks eloquently ponder whether or not he's evil. I'm a big fan of David Fincher	Someone should make Avatar: The Last Airbender into a movie. With such a good show as its source material, there's no way it could go wrong! Edit: tv show, not a book. I'm an idiot	1
Reddit, what is the stupidest thing a teacher gave you detention for?	I got a detention in 8th grade for calling my art teacher by his first name. He said it was disrespectful for me to walk in and say "What up, Doug?"	Coughing. In 5th grade my fucking teacher thought I was "disrupting class" and gave me a detention and then gave me a week's worth when I couldn't stop. She acted as if I had a choice to cough.	0
What moment made you hug your pet the most?	when my shit stain of a sister decided instead of having a family that respects and loves her that she would rather post herself spreading her legs on the internet. she got kicked out and i lost a dog i really loved and cared for in the process. I care about that dog more than I do about her.	My dad died from cancer when I was a kid. My mom checked out for a while afterwards. I was alone in my room crying on the floor and my dog must have heard me because the big goof swung the door open by shoving it with her nose, looked at me with the derpiest face, cocked her head to the side, walked over and then got really serious. She furrowed her brow and studied my face for a second before licking my tears off my cheeks and nestling her head around my neck. I never hugged that dog harder than the day she hugged me. She spent every day with my dad when he was sick and she missed him too, I'm sure. But for a while there, she was the only one who seemed to see me and she never let me cry alone. Fucking loved that dog.	0
What is a fact that you know that makes people ask "Why do you know that"?	Every 7 million'th person is physicaly equal ad the first one at birth.(but only like a white guy can only get a white "clone" and a Black guy only a Black one. No that is not racism)	I was once talking to a younger guy in a bar who revealed that he was born in 1988, and I said, "Oh my god, you're younger than Who Framed Roger Rabbit? That movie came out in 1988!' He replied, "What are you, the Rain Man of when movies were released?" I paused for a moment and said, "Rain Man also came out in 1988."	0
What's the worst/most uncomfortable/most annoying feeling in the world that isn't physically painful?	That ghost hair that keeps touching your fucking face or eyelashes or jabbing you awkwardly in the eye. It doesn't hurt. It's just there to remind you that it exists while you flail your hands around your head trying to find it ALL. DAMN. DAY.	Sitting on a public transportation with a spot right next to you and am cute girl is approaching that may or may not sit next to you. She sits elsewhere -> "She thinks I'm hideous for sure!" She sits next to you -> "Goddamnit now I have less space for myself I just wanted to spread my legs" You just can't win	1
Do you guys have an interesting idea for how I can get my girlfriend's ring size?	ask her mother? Find one in her jewellery box and then get it sized? edit: I've done both, worked like a charm!	All rings can be resized. Get her one that is too small to put the subconscious idea in her head that she need to lose weight. Let's face it, they ALL do.	1
Photo developers of Reddit, what photos made you feel uneasy or felt the need to call the cops?	It's honestly kind of scary that there was a time that you took pictures and had no idea what they looked like until you developed them and that the people who developed them would just watch it and invade your privacy. If it broke out that Google could actually see all pictures you took on your android phone that'd be a mad scare but that used to be the reality. Thank god I can now take all my murder and kiddie porn pictures in private.	I worked at a non-corporate photo lab. One day we got a roll of grisly photos including crispy burned bodies. They shook me (no puking, though). I brought them to the owner’s attention and was informed that these pictures were taken by a regular customer who was an insurance investigator.	0
Former bullies of Reddit, when did you realize you'd gone too far?	I wasn't a major bully, but there was a kid I picked on for years in Middle School. I recently found him on Facebook and wrote a pretty long apology.	Let's start with, why the fuck are you a bully? I think it is quite rare for them to change, they just grow up to be the asshole in traffic doing shitty things for the sake of doing shitty things. More power to them if they do change.	1
What is the craziest "it's a small world" moment you've experienced?	When I went to after school, pretty much everyone knew the owner, and his daughter who was a year older than me. When I switched schools, she was in my school. She also was in my group for cheerleading try outs. So that's pretty cool, I guess.	I was on a deployment with a bunch of dudes I didn't know. One day we're sitting around having a few beers, getting to know each other. It comes out that Sergeant Smith and I have something in common: his soon to be ex wife is from the area of Texas that I grew up in. So the questioning went like this: SGT: Her family lives out by the puddle jump airport. ME: That's funny, I know a girl that grew up around that airport...she was a paralegal before she joined the military. SGT: My soon to be ex wife used to be a paralegal before joining the military. ME: Does she have long, very straight brown hair...blue eyes? SGT: Yup ME: Does she have a green lizard tatoo on her left boob? SGT: Did you fuck my wife? ME: Yup We became pretty good friends afterwards....	0
What is the craziest thing you've seen somebody do at the workplace?	Okay so for a short period of time the manager of my job left the job to start his own buiseness and when he came back and with him he bought back Casual Fridays and this one alcoholic slut and she was wearing a shirt as a dress and when she was confronted her boob fell out and then she pulled the shirt dress thing up and she wasn't wearing panties and then she bent over and we just saw every nasty thing. Ugh, true story.	I work at a printing company. We often print on foil paper. That's aluminum foil laminated to regular paper. On the press the rolls spin pretty fast and are up to five feet in diameter. They are essentially massive, 1500 pound capacitors. One guy stands there holding his hand to the roll as it spins and waits for an unsuspecting passerby. When the victim walks by he reaches out to them and shoots a thick, crackling arc of static electricity at them, up to a foot away. He literally has a bright lightening bolt shooting from his fingertips.	0
