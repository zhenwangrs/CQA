Non-LGBT people, what inappropriate questions do you want to ask LGBT people?	What are trannys considered sexually? Like if a man considers herself a woman, are you gay if you date a dude, even if you keep the dick? What's the general number of male to female or vice versa that are attracted to each gender?	When you hug another naked woman, do you interleave your boobs in order to get closer? If so, *who gets to decide* whether you interleave to the left or the right? Does it feel as hideously wrong to interleave your boobs on the wrong side as it does to interleave your fingers on the wrong side? Is this considered reasonable grounds for ending a relationship?
Incredible high school teacher goes far beyond what is required of her. Giving less fortunate students free breakfast and lunch, clothes, and far more. I think she deserves more recognition and support. What do you say, Reddit?	Ugh I can't read this, it's making my chest turn into mush. I'm glad there are good people out there to counterbalance lazy apathetics such as myself.	Before I retired, I did something similar. I would bring in lunch for a bunch of kids (cold cuts and bread). Then, once a week (or two, depending on my fiscal situation), I would get a party platter of Subway or pizza or etc for them. I called it the "Feed A Tired And Starving Student" program. The kids loved both the food and the acronym.
I moved into my apartment 4 months ago and have yet to receive an electric bill. Reddit, have you ever fallen through the cracks in the system? What happened &amp; how long did it last?	You didn't fall through the cracks. You will receive a bill, maybe next month, maybe next year, for every cent that you owe. And not only will you have to pay it, you will have no recourse if you choose not to, because chances are this exact situation is written into the service agreement and contract that you signed.	I sent my broken dell laptop in for replacement. Dell had 2 addresses on file (parents house and my new apartment). I got 2 new laptops instead of 1.
Why shouldn't I move to your country?	Trump. Not only him though, that we could have elected him in the first place speaks volumes for where we currently are.	The "Gringo tax". If you look or sound foreign, people will asume you must be filthy rich and they'll charge you more than they would charge a regular mexican.
What was the dumbest rule your parents had growing up?	Ah yes, the confusion of down under. This is off topic but how the hell does summer break work down there. Is it just in like December?	I am the oldest of three brothers. Any time I would "graduate" to getting allowed to do something because they deemed me old enough to, my younger brothers would get the same permission at the same time. This wasn't a rule per se, just something that happened a lot. For instance: later bedtime, being able to watch PG-13 movies, being able to watch R movies, being able to stay out late with friends. This may seem trivial, but I ended up having a much more sheltered life than either of my brothers.
What simple everyday task suddenly becomes the loudest thing on earth when you try to do it at 3am in a sleeping household?	Sex. Try to put your hand over her mouth for a muffle and all of a sudden you're ino some weird kinks.	The automatic ice dispenser from the fridge. Daytime, its a mild disturbance, whereas at night, it sounds like Lucifer poking his head through a newly formed fissure, releasing the sound of eons of tormented souls all at once.
What is the single most wholesome thing someone has said to you ?	My boyfriend first met my parents and we were cracking jokes at each other and my mom said jokingly along the lines of, "You two are trouble!" My boyfriend then says, "They say two wrongs doesn't make a right, but in this case it does." I cried	A friend of mine texted me, "Hey, you doin' OK?" I replied, "Yup." He then texted, "Then so am I."
What popular piece of advice is bullshit?	"Dress for the job you want, not the job you have." While I realize a certain level of professionalism in dress is necessary, I'm not going to change who I am to conform to someone else's expectation of what I should look like.	"Keeping a balance and paying interest on your credit card is good for your credit score" NO, IT DOESN'T IMPROVE YOUR CREDIT SCORE. STOP NEEDLESSLY PAYING THE ABSURD INTEREST ON YOUR CREDIT CARD. PLEASE. edit: Just want to clarify that the paying interest part is the intensely terrible part. Having revolving credit and paying it off in full is good stuff.
What did you learn in school that you thought would end up being useless but actually helped you a lot though life?	Pythagoras theorem, I thought I’d never have a use for the triangles but turns out I ......joking, fuck you pyFAGeras you ruined year 11.	That situation on group projects where half (or more) of the "team" you're assigned to doesn't give a shit about doing any of the work and just wants to get a passing grade through no knowledge or effort. Well, that's a pretty handy guide to the working world. In most office jobs I've had 25% of the people did 75% of the work (or more). . .
What's it like being a beautiful woman?	Probably not as aggravating as being a mildly attractive one. We have to work on our personalities not just our eyebrows. Besides I'm sure beautiful girls dont attract the same level of stalker as us middle range ladies do, something about being a possible attainable female makes the weirdos flock to you like crows to a corpse.	I was on both ends of that social divide. I used to morbidly obese yet socially invisible. No assistance at stores. But then strangers can come up and give random diet tips or advice. I lost 150 lbs. Suddenly so much attention! Doors were held open, sales people flocked to help. I've had old ladies on the bus play with my hair (always strange). I felt more unwanted attention now....from the kind of people who may have horrible intentions.
Cab drivers of reddit: what is the most absurd place someone has asked you to take them to/ who is the most absurd person you've had in your cab?	Not a cab driver but a funny story none the less. A few friends and I were in Vegas when we decided to get a cab to get to another Casino. During the ride I guess my friend noticed the guys interesting name (don't remember it) and decided to take out his phone and take a picture of his taxi permit, camera flash and all. So, for the next 10 minutes of this ride the Indian cabbie began interrogating us as to why he did that, are we reporting him, asking us who we were etc. Needless to say I was stoked when we finally got out.	My dad locked his keys in his car. He had to get my brother and I home from the visit or face deep shit from my mom's side of the family, and he didn't think a locksmith would work quickly enough. So he calls a cab, figuring out he'll get back into the car after he drops us off. The driver pulls up, and says basically 'no, no, this isn't right' and pulls out a slim jim, getting into the car in seconds. He saved my dad the money of a lock smith AND of paying the taxi fare. My dad tried to pay him for his time and he refused to accept it. Cool guy.
If we could download smells, what would be on your smell playlist?	I've gotten into indie perfumes so I have a lot of the scents mentioned here. I actually have a perfume that smells like maple-drizzed, chocolate covered, wood-smoked bacon. I've found a scent that smells exactly like my grandma too. Now I'm looking for a scent that smells like babies' heads..they always have that nice, milky scent.	The outside of a really good steak restaurant, where the air smells like hot fries and cooking beef. Or a carnival funnel cake stand. I'd smell it while eating gross healthy food and lose weight. Also some... um... other smells. nevermind.
People who don't signal when driving; why don't you?	My blinker just decides to not work 1/100th of the time, not enough of a problem to fix it but still happens	Top Responses When I Ask This Question: 1. Didn't I? I thought I did... 2. I forgot. 3. It's broken. 4. I didn't think I needed to. 5. Nobody uses their turn signal around here!
What is the dumbest reason you got punished as a child?	In freshman year, I wanted to include something about religion in my essay \(FYI I'm an atheist\). My dad, despite being a fellow atheist, got really angry and yelled at me not to do it due to fucking "political correctness." Like, what the fuck is his problem? In the seventh grade, one of the eighth graders \(he was the kind of person that would be mean on purpose, the as a joke\) teased me about me wearing my glasses. I flipped him off 5 times and kicked him lightly in the leg because I was kind of pissed. Makes sense right? Then, he, for some reason, decided that it was okay to punch me as if there was not tomorrow and made my mouth bleed. Apparently, we both deserved equal punishments. I don't know about you guys, but I believe that he should have been punished worse. Oh well	When I was 13 I was grounded for pointing out that my dad was measuring something incorrectly while we were building our deck. He wasn't taking into account the width of the boards when calculating and the subsequent boards would all end up being too short, so I calmly pointed it out to him. He lost his shit, called me disrespectful, and I was sent off to the basement and didn't get to eat dinner (which was his go-to punishment for my disrespect). He ended up cutting well over two dozen boards to the incorrect length and had to go back to the lumber yard for more. He never actually acknowledged that he was wrong about it. We don't talk much anymore.
What real life events would we consider unrealistic, bad writing or plot holes if they were fictional?	A real estate developer with a long history of bankruptcies, financial chicanery and racist statements - and zero political experience - being elected president of the United States.	The entire Cold War, but especially the multiple times we almost got into a nuclear war but it was stopped at the last minute by one person.
Which fanbase has been betrayed the most?	Starwars. Except for rogue one the Disney takeover has absolutely ruined the franchise for older fans. (By older I mean 25 + i.e not kids )	I'd say anyone who's a fan of any Konami game. "Love Metal Gear? We're firing the creator! That Silent Hill game we were making with Del Toro? Canceled! Now if you'll excuse us, we have to go make Pachinko machines out of your favorite video games (instead of making actual video games)."
What small decision you've made, turned out to be the biggest?	Left my uncle alone working on my kitchen backsplash while I went to the store. Ripped out my entire master bathroom during the hour I was gone, and demanded 5000 dollars I don;t have to fix it, which looks like it will ultimately lead to me being unable to refinance, and eventually losing my house to foreclosure.	I was unemployed and had to buy a new pair of shoes. I went to the factory store outlet of a shoe company and got a pair, then said to myself "wonder if they're hiring?" They were. It's been two years and I'm an assistant manager in the corporate office. Best pair of shoes I ever bought.
What are your thoughts on the Mars rover Curiosity that is set to land in the next few days?	No one knows about it, but it's a really impressive step forward in deep space exploration. I'm particularly pleased that the guys at NASA/JPL and assorted supporting NGOs (ex. Mars Society) are getting much better at marketing this stuff. The only way to get people excited about space exploration is to make sure they know it's going on in the first place.	This thing weighs a ton. It is the size of an SUV, and is the first such rover to have the instruments on board to detect life. It is also the most complicated landing maneuver to ever be attempted. I am SO excited about it!
[Serious] Germans of Reddit, in what ways, if at all, does Germany recognize WWII veterans?	WW2 veterans are mostly dead and due to the fact that the Nazi regime tried to oppress at least whole Europe, killed 6 Mio Jews etc. no veteran is honored at all (which is fine IMO). Only some neo-Nazis try to honor WW2 veterans. I think they did not "fight for their country", they had to serve a criminal regime. And both my grandfathers, who had to serve, did not find anything honorable.	In my family we never really talked about it. My grandfather was happy to share some stories about his time as a POW in France but not about his time as a soldier. And I'm pretty sure I never really asked. There is a German expression called "totschweigen" which basically means to keep quiet about something to make it "die". That is how many families approach their WW2 history.
Getting divorced, can I ask for the engagement ring back?	Personally, I agree with you. I would ask for the ring back. But, for a woman, getting rid of a diamond is not that simple. I don't think she will.	There is no harm in asking. However most states have laws that clearly dictate the contract of marriage and ring ownership. The fact that you were married leaves very little chance that she legally has to give you the ring. Do you want it back for financial reasons? A divorced diamond tends to be tainted.
Men of Reddit, when was the last time you were truly happy, what was the cause, and how did you know you were happy?	There's something about watching a small child laugh that makes me feel warm inside. Most adults and even older children just don't have that joyful, not-a-care-in-the-word laugh of innocence that a happy child can have. Seeing someone that happy makes me happy.	I was driving home last week and passed the Taco Bell near my house. Saw a notice indicating that Nacho Fries were back on the menu.
Whats your moment of point of no return on a date?	I don't really believe in dating or a committed relationship for that matter. On the off chance that a girl invites me out or what ever you will call it. The point of no return for me is when they let me do ANYTHING, nothing is a larger turn off than some one who is willing to look the other way.	Upon wondering where my way too drunk date had wandered off too, I asked the doorman of the bar we were at if she had walked by. That is when I saw her blowing the ex boyfriend. They were standing in the middle of the parking lot. Guess they weren't that *ex*
Guys, what social expectations of men do you wish did not exist?	All social expectations of any gender roles shouldn't exist. Why even ask in particular? People are born a certain gender. There should be no specific expectation according to gender. Rather expectations that apply to everybody equally independent of their gender.	I’m a nurse. As a guy that means I get all the combative, violent, and morbidly obese patients because I can “handle it better.”
Long time teachers of reddit: How is teaching students now compared to 10, 20, and 30+ years ago?	With Children you need to keep them entertained, same goes for Teens but you need to let on that you know they are teens, with adults they are always questioning what you do. Oh i thought you were talking about age groups.	25 years of secondary education in the UK. I believe that the students have not changed, however the parents and community have. All students still have the potential to achieve but quite a few lack traditional parenting therefore they believe they can get away with anything.
What is the sickest burn you have seen a teacher give to a student?	In 6th grade to class decided to randomly tell the whole class (I was already far from popular) that I looked heavily medicated. Fuck you, Mrs. Clark you piece of shit bitch EDIT: wow I wonder why I got so downvoted. interesting	student: "can we postpone the math test. it's on my birthday." teacher: "well unlike your birthday this math test was planned ahead of time."
Men of Reddit, what is something that women will never understand?	~~Why questions like this get asked?~~ HELP. MY VAGINA KEEPS ME FROM UNDERSTANDING THINGS. Edit: "Talking shit is more effective when your sentence doesn't read like Trey Parker impersonating a Chinese man." - /u/JewsCantbePaladins had a point, so I went ahead and edited for sarcastic clarity.	In my experience, I've never chatted with the guys about my SO's vagina. The fact that my ex had in depth conversations with her work friends regarding my penis is weird. And no, even if Sean isn't REALLY a dickhead, I have no interest in what your friend has to say about his junk.
What's the one sub you hate seeing on the front page?	r/Politics or r/EnoughTrumpSpam -- They are one and the same. It's not that I like Trump, but it's just those subs are run by CTR.	/r/nosleep I always read the title and be like that sounds interesting, then see it was from no sleep and just move on the the next post
Pick any 2 movies from the same actor. Those movies are now part of the same reality. What happened to the actor to get them from movie A to movie B?	Ewan McGreggor, trainspotting and star wars TPM. After getting off of heroin and getting his life back together, he finds his true calling in the jedi arts, trains hard, and becomes Obi Wan Kenobi.	Edward Norton undergoes psychoactive therapy to get the Hulk under control. After many painful years, he manages to successfully get one split personality under control, only to release another - Tyler Durden.
[Serious] Agnostics/Atheists of Reddit,what made you stop believing in God?	The whole premise of a 'god' is silly and laughable. It doesn't really have a place in modern society. Religion is a throwback from our caveman days when we didn't have science to explain the world around us and attributed everything we didn't understand to some higher power or deity. Most of mankind allow themselves to be controlled by a religion that professes existence of an omnipotent super-being, but this being has never been proven to exist at all. If god were so powerful, why doesn't he show himself to the modern world? Too busy watching everybody masturbate?	Nothing made me stop believing. Rather, nothing ever made me start believing in the first place. The stories just seemed outlandish as young as I can remember: it was like a boring version of cartoons. My parents took me to church and Sunday school, but they believe in the concept of God rather than a specific church's perception. So they didn't particularly mind that I did not want to go anymore. I've just always been comfortable with the reality that I can sense. Whether or not there's "more" out there isn't really relevant. If there is a higher power, it clearly doesn't want us to know.
What's a plot hole in history?	Regardless of political opinion (A.K.A. please don't start a 'debate'), how in the name of all that is holy did we get to the point where the choices for President of the United States are a guy with dementia that reads off of a teleprompter and can't hold his phone correctly, and a compulsive liar who Tweets offensive and crude statements that often times make no sense?	Henry VIII had a bastard son, Henry Fitzroy, but instead of changing the rules to make a bastard able to inherit the throne, he changed the rules so that he could get a divorce on the off-chance that his new wife would give him a legitimate son.
What's the most confusing or depressing compliment you ever received?	For a while I worked in the dining hall on campus, and a professor came through the checkout line with her young daughter. I chatted with them and made the little girl laugh, and as they walked away the little girl said "That's the nicest cafeteria lady I've ever met!" I was 19 at the time, and a reasonably attractive female, but I felt absolutely horrible for the rest of the shift because "cafeteria lady" just did not in any way fit with my idea of who I was. I quit the job a few weeks later.	I've told this story here before but I'll tell it again. I'm a medical researcher at a hospital in NY. One day I was standing in front of my exam room, waiting for a patient to come in and I noticed a really old woman staring at me in the hallway. I asked her if she needed any help and she said "no I'm fine. I'm sorry for looking at you but you remind me so much of my late husband. You look very handsome just like him". I said "well he must've been a good looking guy. What did he do for a living?" Her demeanor changed completely and she said "I hated that bastard, he was a nazi" and she spit on the floor. Thats when I learned I was handsome...like a Nazi
What movie did everyone miss the point of?	Lion King, maybe not the point of it. But it's Hamlet with animals, and almost no one knew at the time.	300. It isn't a historical movie about the battle. It's a story being told by the guy who got the axe to the eye. He embellished every moment when no one else could corroborate the story in to wild moments to hype the army that was about to face the Persians at the end.
I had sex with my new girlfriend's wife before we met and she wants us to all have dinner! What do I do!?	I'd tell her the truth before you meet her mom. All of it. If she happens to find out later (mom gets drunk, spills the beans to her daughter), there's no telling what conclusions she'll come to. (OMG, are you STILL sleeping with her.. etc) If it's going to fail, it's better to fail now, rather than investing time to have it fail later.	I can't wait until you discover the love child you had with the mother. Then you will be dating your childs sister.
When Disney exhaust all the obvious choices, which star wars character should get their own movie?	I thinl there should be a movie about the rakatan culture and the star forge, because there are so many interesting things in the star wars universe and they only make stuff around this lame ass trilogy	Jabba the Hutt - and I've put some serious thought into this. Have it be like the Godfather and show Jabba going from a young Hutt to the the galaxy's most feared crime lord.
what if everyone was born as a neutral gender and at the age of 10 you have to select whether you'd be a male or female. Would you stay the same gender you are now? what would you choose?	Gender is what society percieves us as. You aren't born with one. You are born with a sex. This is why we have people who are male but women or female but men. Men =/= Male	Back then I was such a tomboy that I would probably have chosen to be a boy, which I would later regret.
What technology is oddly primitive for 2018?	Staged rockets. We have the tech for single-stage-to-orbit spaceplanes. We *almost* have the tech for a space elevator. We should be past the "throw most of it away when it's done its job" stage by now. Farming. It's 2018; how are we still making our food by sticking things in the ground, waiting for them to grow, then throwing most of it away? Transport. Why are we still using manual control for the majority of our point-to-point transportation?	CCTV. Every time i watch CCTV footage of an event on television, it looks like it was recorded on a potato.
people who were single while in their late 30's or 40's did you find love? whats the story?	I found love whilst being single actually. Just never really felt the need to enter into a relationship with the people I loved. Freedom is cool so they just became "romantic friends" if you will—works fine for me.	My mom wasn't married until she was 37. Her story isn't anything particularly special - she was working as an engineer and she just never found the right guy until she met my dad through work. They got married and they're still pretty happy together 20 years later. They compliment each other pretty well. You can find love at any age, both of my parents are normal, likable, successful people who for whatever reason just didn't find love as early as some people.
When was the worst time you had to poo?	Many years ago a beautiful younger woman had given me the opportunity to go get a hotel room with her (I was married and she lived at home) , but a minute into the kiss by her car to leave I felt the largest turd get loaded into the torpedo tube. There was no way I could cover up the smell in a hotel room, so I had to backpedal and decline what was probably going to be one of the best memories of my life. Yeah, scummy for being married, but you just don't turn down someone as amazing as her, except if you gotta shit. She's had a great life and after my divorce mine got better as well.	Walking the dog a few weeks ago. She's still a puppy. Spicy food hit me bad. Had to go in a port-a-potty. Dog had to cram in with me. I'll never forget the look on her face. She was so betrayed.
What is your most interesting airplane/airport travel story?	To paraphrase George Carlin, I got high on the plane. You can get high on the plane, and you can get *high on the plane*	My mother once accidentally knocked down a security guard in a Spanish Airport. She passed through the metal detector and it beeped, and because it always happens to her she was prepared for it so immediately threw her arms up so that they could search her. One of her arms caught the security guard in the face and she went down. It was one of the funniest moments ever upon reflection but at the time everything went crazy.
What type of people annoy you even though they're not actually doing anything wrong?	Vegans. Or more specifically preachy vegans. Ok great you practice what you preach, but has it every crossed your mind that defining who you are by what you eat and telling everyone about it makes you an insufferable arsehole? Yes some aspects of farming are awful and should change but you're not going to make that happen by stamping your little cruelty-free moccasined feet and demanding people don't eat meat, because frankly it's delicious. You would make more headway by supporting humane, ecologically friendly, sustainable farming. If enough customers demands it, it will happen. Posting a video of chicks being minced on Facebook will just make people hate you. I could literally go on for hours...	People who fish for compliments. There's this one girl I know who always says stuff like "oh my hair is so ugly today" or "I have such a terrible singing voice" and then pauses after she says it so someone will compliment her. The worst part is people like that often get mad when you *don't* compliment them. Honestly people like that just make me want to tear my hair out. Edit: I actually got some great tips her and I am going to use some of them now. Thanks guys
(Serious) People of Reddit who have HIV/AIDS, when did you realize something was wrong?	1996 was when it became manageable--1995 was the worst year ever, 50,000 died of AIDS that year alone--Also the suicide rate has also dramatically decreased since then--Suicide was an epidemic among HIV positive gay men from 1985 to 1995--Perhaps the most dramatic suicide was when 2 gay HIV positive men wrapped themselves together in their purple curtain, and jumped out the window, plunging to their deaths 20 stories below	I was actually born with it, 26 years old now. I've been taking medicine all of my life and didn't know why. When I was 10 at an appointment, my doctor asks "would you like to know why you take medicine?" Of course I wanted to know. I went in to years of depression wanting to die my CD4 count was only at 27 while the viral load was over 300,000. I never wanted to take meds again. Now I'm 26 and I see that I'm one of the lucky ones and it's not a death sentence. It also has made me more humble and open minded to other people. I also appreciate life more and those unluckier than me more Edit: Sorry I was at work everyone , I will try to answer all of your questions.
When I grab a bite and leave the computer open I always make sure no GIF is running, because I like to imagine it's exhausting for it. What are some weird little habits of yours?	I sometimes (all the time) act like I'm on a sitcom and cameras are on me so I perform for them by being dramatic or looking to a camera and doing finger guns or something.	Whenever I pet one of my cats, I immediately go pet the other one too so it doesn't feel less loved.
Redditors who had sex with their teacher/professor/instructor/coach etc., can youtell us your story?	This one time my English teacher came on to me after having failed on of her papers. It was after school got out and everybody was doing their normal thing. Thus, I was alone in the room with this smoking lady, early 30s, with some sort of Spanish/Portuguese in her. At first, I didn't realize it at first, but she had been dropping these hints over the last semester. It wasn't until now that I noticed that she was leaning over, shirt revealing, whilst she was talking to me. I had thought back to the previous discussions about my writing and decided "maybe she wants this" and went for it. Of course, I clumsily grabbed at her shirt but she took my advances and slid her hand quickly down my pants and pulled out the [Serious] tag OP forgot.	We had a teacher at my high school who got caught fucking an underage student. His wife started divorce proceedings and he was put on administrative leave pending an investigation. He went to a nice quiet park bench in front of a lake, pulled out a revolver and blew his fucking brains out. It happened right at the end of the school year so the yearbook had already been printed. He was a History teacher in the International Baccalaureate program for the wicked smart kids (or IB Program as it was commonly known). So right there under his smiling picture in the faculty section of the yearbook was the caption "IB History." Everyone made the morbid joke that those were his last words before putting the gun in his mouth.
[Serious] [Repost] Scientists of Reddit: What's the craziest or weirdest thing in your field that you suspect is true but is not yet supported fully by data?	[Computer Science] True artificial intelligence (i.e. sentient) will never be achieved. Things like fully autonomous vehicles will never (safely) happen. There are too many things that an automated vehicle will never be able to account for. Even Google's autonomous car is VERY limited in what it actually does. There's too much intuition that goes into driving that a computer can never do.	[Biopharmaceuticals] People with Autoimmune disorders get infections far less often than people with a normal immune system. My rational is the hypersensitivity of the immune system in these individuals allows their systems to react to far lower infection titers and far quicker than a normal response, preventing most illnesses. If this is proven to be true, by increasing the sensitivity of a regular person's immune system, they could theoretically get sick far less often. Additionally, IgG isolated from specific Hypersensitive individuals may be more effective against various illnesses than regular IVIG.
What is a 100% original joke you've made up?	This is racist, so don't read if you'll be offended. What do you call a black guy from Ireland? **A lepra-coon**	When I was around 7 or 8 I found out laryngitis was when you lost your voice. So... I told my grandpa that he must have hair-ingitis because he was bald. So, all bald people have hair-ingitis.
What Was Your Biggest "Holy Shit I Missed All of the Signs" Moment?	I had a friend in school that i thought was really grubby, turned out he was mixed race. it was made mpre confusing because I had met his parents and both were white turned out his dad was really his step dad.	In college, a girl in a few of my classes asked if she could come over and do some laundry because the dorm washer/dryer were down, then maybe do some calculus while we were waiting. She came over, forgot her laundry basket, forgot all of her calculus books/notes, and didn't really have a plan of why she was there; she suggested she could wash the clothes she was wearing, but all my clothes were too big to fit her while those were getting washed. So we played with my guinea pig for a while and tried both using my calc book before she ended up just going home. Took me almost two years before a different girlfriend pointed out how dense I was.
[Serious] Redditors that drive at night, what's the craziest/creepiest/scariest thing you've seen while driving?	not crazy, creepy, or really scary, but shocking. about a month ago I was driving back home at around 1 am after dropping my friend off at her home after a local event we went to together. she lives in a semi rural area about 20 minutes away from my home. had just dropped her off and was just getting onto the main road near her house when all of a sudden a deer leapt right out in front of me from the side of the road. I stomped on my brakes and luckily avoided hitting it but man did that shock me.	Worked a job cleaning restaurant hoods for a while. It entailed driving place to place all night. The scariest thing I ever saw was in Northeast Kansas one night at around 3am. We had been traveling for about 100 miles and I was sitting in the passenger seat while my coworker drove. A huge meteor streaked across the sky right out in front of our truck. It was one of those that lit up the whole sky for a good few seconds. Coolest one I ever saw. I looked over at the guy driving and said "did you see that?" "See what?" I drove the rest of the night.
What is the worst restaurant experience you've ever had?	Ordered a soup of TomYum at my local sushi restaurant. The sushi there is the best I've ever eaten - even a Restaurant in a 5 stars hotel in London didn't get this good sushi. So thought the soup tasted also so good but It tasted like soap....	Went to a waffles place and the server was training someone new. That's fine, I'm all for it. I work in food service so I know the struggle. But, I'd never been there before so I was taking my time looking at the menu and when I ordered my plate, she asked what sides I'd like. Obviously not knowing what sides were optional I asked, and she was just so incredibly rude about the answer, rushing out all of them and then even throwing in "what's the matter, you just wake up or something? Come on man!" Needless to say I didn't tip. But if you're ever just needlessly rude to a customer u can fuck the fuck rite off
Conspiracy theorist of Reddit: What conspiracy do you absolutely believe to be true?	9/11, I work on drilling rigs, no way steel comes down that easy. A 1-3/8" cable can lift a million pounds. No way slight structural weaknesses caused by heat crushed and splintered every steel beam in those buildings. Not possible, steel is obnoxiously resilient.	That when reddit added 20 or 50 or whatever subs to the default list, they were intentionally making the default front page as unappealing and downright shitty as possible to motivate people to create accounts, log in, and use their accounts.
What’s your real opinion on why the US has more mass shootings than any other country?	Fun theory: Staged by left wingers to convince the public to push their agendas. My actual opinion: More people = more lunatics. "Gun control" has nothing to do with it.	When a reporter asked film critic Roger Ebert about what causes school shootings, he gave this answer: "Events like this, if they are influenced by anything, are influenced by news programs like your own. When an unbalanced kid walks into a school and starts shooting, it becomes a major media event. Cable news drops ordinary programming and goes around the clock with it. The story is assigned a logo and a theme song; these two kids were packaged as the Trench Coat Mafia. The message is clear to other disturbed kids around the country: If I shoot up my school, I can be famous. The TV will talk about nothing else but me. Experts will try to figure out what I was thinking. The kids and teachers at school will see they shouldn't have messed with me. I'll go out in a blaze of glory."
Waiters of Reddit, what is the strangest thing someone has ordered?	Once I got two honkies at my table dressed like Hasidic diamond merchants. The tall one wanted white bread, toasted, dry, with nothin' on it. And the other one asked for four whole fried chickens and a Coke.	I worked in Applebees in high school and although not very strange I had a table where after I delivered the food I did the "everything all good" check up and noticed a woman was staring at her plate like it was about to jump off the table. I asked her what was wrong and she told me the plate color was just too off and that she needed an orange plate. I went back and got a different color plate and you could see the instant relief on her face when the food moved plates. I guess she really had something against green plates.
Women of Reddit, is making constant loud sounds of enjoyment during sex real or just a show to make men happy?	My girlfriend doesn't make a sound. Completely silent. But then again, I guess I would be concerned if a dead person was making sounds.	It varies from woman to woman. I freely admit, though, that sometimes I make noise not because I feel particularly good, but because I know that it makes sex more enjoyable for my partner. That said, sex is always more fun when I can be noisy.
Reddit, what is your true story I would call bullshit on if I saw it happen in a movie?	In college. I drunkenly stumbled into the wrong house. Walked in on 2 guys having sex with a girl in the living room. Without a word, I walked over and inserted myself into her ass. I finished pretty quickly and walked out. The really weird thing is that I knew my neighbors. The 3 people going at it when I walked in weren't them. 3 Seemingly random people banging in my neighbor's living room.	I was golfing with my then-boyfriend and he got a hole in one. The group of guys teeing off at the next hole cheered for him and waited around to shake his hand. We chatted for a while, then everyone carried on with their game. The next day, we went to a bowling alley and the boyfriend bowled a 300 game (he was one of those guys who was just great at everything he tried, damn him). The employees announced his score over the PA system and everyone cheers. From the other end of the bowling alley, we hear a commotion, and then see the same group of guys from the golf course making their way over to shake his hand again.
You just won a coffee with God, you can only ask one question, what do you ask? What do you expect God to say?	*sip* So what's with all the evil? Are you unwilling or unable to get rid of it? *sip* I don't expect him to say anything as he vanishes in a puff of logic.	Me: Really only one question? God: Yup Me: Shit... that counted, didn't it? God: We're done here Me: This coffee is pretty good atleast
What are some books that made you go "whoa" after reading them?	Ready player one. I was so amazed by that book. Dune was amazing too. Discworld are awesome books too, still reading through them	Asimov's short story "The Last Question." Also "The Great Divorce" by CS Lewis because of the way he deals with determinism, freedom, and time.
If a stranger approached you and said “I know what you did”, what would be the first thing to come to your mind?	i didnt fuck my cat. i didnt cum on my cat. i didnt put my dick anywhere near my cat. Ive never done anything weird with my cats. I promised myself i wasnt going to make apology videos after last years thing so im just trying to be as short and honest with this as possible.	I was at Target and I had two apples in those weird plastic bags and I forgot to put them on the scanner for the Clerk to see and then I walked out of target forgetting to pay for those apples but I was in a hurry and I just drove off.
I'm a 24 year old single guy attempting to foster a 9 year old client temporarily. DCF will be at my house in less than an hour. Any advice or words of encouragement, Reddit?	Don't have sex with the child, no matter how much they may beg. This turns the child into a gremlin.	My wife licenses foster parents. Relax, be friendly, don't mention crack, and make sure your house is up to fire and safety code. Good people typically get the greenlight.
What is your earliest memory of using the internet?	I'm older than a lot of people here......I will never forget first going online in 1997, and into an AOL chat room at my brother's house. It was for NFL football and everyone was going back and forth about their favorite teams and I loved it! Wasn't long after that that I had my first PC, cost 2 grand and today's phones are MUCH better and have much more drive space, but it was a start. Within 2 years I had mastered that thing and was saying to myself "there has GOT to be a way I can make money from this thing." By 2001 I had a few porn sites online, and between then and 2010 I had grossed 3 million bucks and had quit my job and I haven't worked a real job since 2002. Thank you, Internet.	First memory of using the Internet? Dial-up tones, and constantly receiving AOL cds in the mail. First cool thing I remember clearly? That 'end of the world' animation by the guy with the crazy accent.
What is the worst restaurant experiece you ever had?	I've had a few and it mostly comes down to rude staff who are shallow af body shaming me. It's experiences like that that make me hate going outside. For some reason the hospitality industry is full of assholes. Always be wary of trendy establishments where all the staff are considered to have a high level of conventional attractiveness. One thing matters to them and if you haven't got it don't expect to be pleased with the experience.	When I worked at Pizza Hut there was a woman who insisted on buying a meat lover's pizza with no meat. That's how she said it. And if you offered her a cheese pizza, you'd better have plugged your butthole because here comes the thunder. Try to explain to her it's a cheese pizza? Nope. Try to explain to her it's more expensive the way she's ordering it? Nope. Nothing worked.
What's the most terrifying thing you've seen in real life?	One of the most terrifying but funny things was where I was driving out to palm springs and these 8 or so illegal aliens in a buick sedan launched over the divider from one side of the freeway to the other and right at me. They were a good 15-20 feet in the air. As I swerved, the sedan bounced off the freeway over my hood and rolled several times before landing on its roof. When we stopped, all the illegals ran out of the car and went running for the mountains 2-3 miles away. Not one of them was hurt but at least 2 were thrown out along with a 12 pack of Bud when it was tumbling. The highway patrol guy even called a few hours later to let me know they were all OK but dehydrated. I said they should have taken the beer.	Waking up totally covered in blood. I was walking to class and got hit by a car. I'm not sure what was happened in the moments leading up to it, but I woke up in the middle of the road, cradling my head. I distinctly remember lifting my head and looking at my blood covered arm, thinking 'I'll deal with that later', and putting my arm back under my head and going back to sleep. I turned out pretty okay, but I genuinely think the accident made me dumber. My grades slipped hard after the event.
Reddit, what is the best way to get out of a physical fight?	Well note I'm early teen when I start to fight with my brother I just punch him in the face one time medium force he starts to cry and stops and he's same age as me we are twins	Getting into a fight was a nearly constant daily possibility at job I used to have. I mostly managed to avoid this with a few easy strategies: * Don't get mad, don't raise your voice. * Appear mildly amused at whatever insults are thrown at you. * Don't escalate, but make it perfectly clear that if they choose to make things physical, you are going to take things a _lot_ farther than they are willing to go. * Always have a bright yellow 3 ft crow bar within easy reach. Did that job for five years and I never had to hurt anybody and I only got shot at a couple of times.
What social experiment would you love to try but is impossible to conduct?	id like to see the results, but id never want to actually try it because its morally fucked. the experiments where you take newborns and put them in crazy environments, in order to try and ascertain what is nature vs. nurture could be used to study language, intelligence, social attitudes, anything	Take a bunch of children and raise them to believe they are living in the late 19th Century. All their caretakers would keep up this charade, and every detail and social event would be replicated. Then introduce them to modern society. Closest we could get to time traveling.
What was the weirdest coincidence you've experienced?	. If mmlk see. Xm do. See ll.dm see see m so Dad sch xx xx. Xx. So a dd....X l see see. Day	When I was 6 years old I was climbing a tree and a piece of bark got lodged in my eye. I ended up having to go to the hospital and get an eye patch. My father comes home from work a few hours later where he assembles furniture, and it turns out he somehow got a piece of metal stuck in his eye. Like me, he had to go to the hospital and get an eye patch too. His was his left, mine was my right, and his eye patch looks exactly the same as mine. This was the only time in either of our lives that we had to get eye patches, and it somehow happens on the same day. Easily the craziest coincidence I've ever experienced.
Redditors who go into peoples' houses for their job, what is the strangest/creepiest thing you've ever seen or experienced?	Once I went to this guy's house He was quite nice He didn't move too much But maybe that was because I had a gun pointed at him	I used to volunteer for a wildlife rescue and did a pickup at a very elderly woman's house where she had found a baby bird. When I got there she carefully uncovered it from the towel she'd placed it in, and it was just a chestnut.
What cringey moment in your life still keeps you up at night when you randomly remember it?	When I was religious...yuck....asking strangers if they know Jesus....how could they not? He is mentioned in every script and there are ten churches on every road. People usually try to hide the truth and stuff the lies down your throat so which one do you think Christianity is?	I was either in first or second grade when this happened. Anyway our p.e. teacher was testing us by making us do sit ups. We were grouped in pairs and when it was my turn my partner was holding my ankles and foot. I did it but every time I did it I would fart and it wasn't one of those silent farts. No it made sound but stupid me didn't want to stop and neither did the farts.
[Serious] Could ISIS eventually become a fully functional state and, if so, what could we expect the long term consequences to be?	Let's just wait for them to get to Jerusalem. Soon as they "desecrate" the site Jesus was killed at all the Americanism will be thrust upon them with the fury of a thousand rednecks.	No because no state will recognise them. They will be able to occupy huge swathes of Iraq and Syria for a long time though and operate unofficially as a pariah state not recognised by anyone. They will still be viewed as an illegitimate occupying force by the world no matter what happens.
why is there no outrage in the US about the fact that your people are spied upon by its own government ?	Meh, they probably aren't even paying attention to anything I do, and it's not like I have any secrets to hide. If your beef is with the privacy aspect, I grew up with 8 siblings, I never had privacy to begin with.	Because it's not negatively impacting us enough yet in practice. It's terrible in theory, but not yet in practice. People are still happy, healthy, and free *enough* that they're focused on their lives.
What's your favourite term for being drunk?	When I'm drunk, I tell everyone they've got a front row seat to the giant jackass show. I've done some stellar things after having been over-served: played piano with my head, peed in the kitty litter, dumped a pitcher of beer over someone's head. By the way, I'm a middle-aged woman. It's not pretty.	Whenever I'd come home completely shit faced as a teen and I'd try and act sober in front of my parents. My mother, having her fair share of drunk experiences, could see right through me and insist I "take my wobbly boot off". One night I was so banged up, I thought she actually meant take my shoes off so I did what any normal person would do in the situation. I face planted onto the floor reaching for my shoes and I knocked my self out cold.
How has Reddit changed you?	I think I've become more conservative after reading the news subs. It's like that bizarre reverse psychology thing where you become more adamant in your beliefs after being told they're wrong.	It has become very rare that someone can show me a funny video or gif that I haven't seen already.
What's a phrase you could say that would make NO sense to some one in 1996?	Donald Trump is gonna be a great president. Oh wait. That wouldn't make sense in any year. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)	My favorite phrase from similar question (same idea, but it was news headlines), was "Galaxy Nexus: Android Ice Cream Sandwich guinea pig."
What are the most acceptable things in society which completely takes a 180° turn if the gender roles are changed in that situation?	If a woman gets abused, raped etc it's bad and people are empathetic. But when it's a guy, people laugh and are not that emphatic. Males are always below women these days. I really hate it.	Not sure if it's actually acceptable, but women who go into men's toilet because the women's one is full. If it's reversed shit goes to hell real quick
Commercial airline pilots of reddit: what's the scariest situation that has ever happened to you mid-flight?	I once had a dream I was an airline pilot. I was flying from Wichita to Denver. My co-pilot who was this random Filipino kid from my Geometry class. He ended up passing out in his steering apparatus thing and we plummeted down towards the ground at about 600 mph. I woke up after that though only to find my bed drenched in sweat. Sorry OP :/	My brother in law is a commercial airline captain (he has never heard of reddit). About two years ago his front landing gear didn't go up all the way and jammed halfway down after take off. They knew immediately something was wrong and did a close fly by of the tower at DIA so the tower people could observe the problem and advise. He had to have the passengers brace for impact and land it not knowing if the front gear that had malfunctioned would buckle or collapse. The gear held up and he landed just fine, but he was scared, and to know him is to know he is never scared, so it must have had potential to go very bad. It made it on the news in Colorado and the airlines ceo called him and thanked him.
Employers of Reddit, what is the most superficial reason you had not to hire an interviewee?	I always sneak outside to see what they drive. If they don't take care of their ride I figure they won't take care of my stuff. Equipment, customers, etc.	I am not sure it is superficial but the email they used to contact them at had a drug reference. If you can't take the time to create a professional contact for a job with benefits then I can't take the risk of getting stuck with you.
What would be the worst time to respond with 'It's just a prank, bro'?	Your family has been gruesomely raped and tortured before being massacred with their naked dismembered corpses strung up all around the house. Your little sister was raped the worst, and the TV is playing back the entire weeklong rape including footage of her asshole merging with her vagina from the brutality. Then some YouTuber comes up with a camera and is like "It's just a prank, bro!"	After 55 years of a man being imprisoned and finally sentenced to an execution. "Sike! You were innocent all along! It's just a prank, bro!"
What's a popular controversy that you believe both sides are wrong about?	Abortion. Extreme pro-lifers: you cannot get out of a pregnancy in any way, shape or form, even if you were raped. Your life is not as important as your unborn child's and you must live with this forever. The Bible says your job as a woman is to be a mother and screw your hopes and dreams. Extreme pro-choicers: disregard all scientific evidence that human life begins at conception, act like abortion is the ONLY option in case of a crisis pregnancy, demean women who are pro-life, use vague language like "right to choose" and "women's rights" (it's ABORTION. Get over it). And if you make the *choice* to have your baby, you're wrong and part of the problem.	The whole bomb clock thing. The kid sucks, the teachers sucked, the kids family sucked, the school sucked. Everyone sucked and is dumb.
Found out my girlfriend has been cheating on me for the last 2 months, I've honestly never felt this low in my life, how do people deal with these kind of feelings?	1. Lawer the fuck up 2. Hit the gym 3. Delete Facebook First one is optional, although as your attorney, I advise you to do #1.	The fact you're angry is good. It shows you still have self-esteem. And it's good that you,re cutting all contacts with her. Avoid her at all costs.
What's viewed as attractive but is a turn off for you?	Breast implants. No hate if that's your thing, but it's a deal-breaker for me. I might be able to overlook it if she was filthy rich, but..... * edit - I don't understand why this is being downvoted. It's an honest answer to the question. Maybe people don't like my joke about her being rich??? oh well	Guys showing their "dominance" or whatever you wanna call it when they try to out douche each other in front of a group of people. Ugh such a turn off.
Former Amish of reddit, what was it like? Why did you leave?	I left my community after deciding that I could not handle the mundane tasks and wondered what was the point of working hard for years to die on a farm. I had a brother, Jeremiah who did the same though he left after I did. Got a job at McDonalds and after saving up some money I now work at a gym as a boxing coach fighting. With every punch I take I repress that amish spirit inside me. Plus now I don't have to spend my days cleaning horse shit, now I can just watch poon and reddit *Edit: I meant poon not poo, I ain't into that shit, not how I roll *you all are fucking stupid if you actually believe that im amish	I'll actually give a serious reply. I grew up Mennonite, the modern variety. My dad's family is of Amish origin. My dad was raised Beachy Amish, which is somewhere in between Mennos and the Old Order Amish in terms of conservative-ness. He grew up in the 50's going to the bathroom in an outhouse, wearing Amish-type clothes, speaking Pennsylvania German (his first language), his dad's car had to be painted black, etc. My grandparents were legit Amish until their teenage years when their parents left the Old Order because it wasn't 'spiritual enough.' My grandma can still be seen wearing an Amish dress and a headcovering and I speak a bit of German with her sometimes. I have done extensive study on the Amish as well as having grown up around all of it. Any questions, please AMA.
[Serious] Soldiers of Reddit who've fought in Afghanistan, what preconceptions did you have that turned out to be completely wrong?	I want to thank everyone in this thread for refreshing my vitriolic hatred of this occupation and everyone that supported it.	Was in the Tangi Valley and we had two of our 4 of hmmwvs broke in the middle of a town. The whole village male population came out to help us dig out our vehicles. Talking like 100-200 people who were digging and shit. Right next to us and with us. Sun went down and it started to snow. Everyone left. We got attacked that night. The villagers didn't want us there. Not because they hated us, but because they knew their mud huts were about to get fucked up in the attack that would happen that night. Christmas Eve, i think 2010?
Straight guys, how many genuinely good female friends do you have that are, and have always been, platonic relationships only?	To put it simply i'm not looking for female friendship, to put it bluntly i want to bang them. If i approach a woman and we just end up being friends so be it, life goes on and more often then not we get out of touch. But the initial intentions is always to be "more then just friends" because i'm attracted to them... That said the only platonic relationships with females (not including family obviously) that i have are with women that I've met trough other people (ex. best mate's gf, friend of a friend, siblings friends....) Edit: to answer your question OP : 1 and that's with my best mate's gf	Honestly if any of them made a move on me I don't think I'd resist - as much as I understand the line and stick to it from my side. There's one or two I really wish I could feel nothing for.
What social norm do you not follow?	There is no reason to call you a mr or mrs (insert name) when it is more efficient and less time-consuming to simply speak your name itself. The illogical notion of respect via titles only wastes time and overcomplicates otherwise simple exchanges. If someone speaks to me I don't want them wasting time with giving me titles and im not doing it for people just because it makes them feel good. If I have things to do I'll refer to you whatever way is quickest and easiest. It just really irks me when people are picky about what they are called, as if their seniority justifies inconveniencing others.	I sleep in a different bedroom than my wife about 95% of the time. My wife is a very light sleeper and I snore a lot, so when we sleep in the same bed she gets very little sleep.
people who've participated in an orgy, at what point, if any, did things get awkward?	At closing time I could not find my clothes or my date's clothes. It was winter and very cold outside and I experienced major shrinkage. My date started to laugh. We had to stop for gas and explaining why I was naked to the officer and his female partner was really difficult.	My wife and I went to a swingers club for the first time just before the pandemic. We meet a really cool couple that made us feel really comfortable and things heated up quickly. The limits we set were no intercourse and no oral. So I’m fingering his wife and he’s fingering mine and I reach over to hold my wife’s hand to make sure she’s doing ok and I hear “Um, wrong hand dude”. I had just tenderly held hands with the dude finger banging my wife. We had a good laugh and then got back to business.
If I could have 1 B-Grade super power it would be to always get a green light, every time. What would yours be?	Eidetic memory... or the ability to speak and understand any language... or the ability to get people to not notice me.	The power to explain how to do anything, but not very well. The kind of explanation that's really awkward, but in the end they know what I mean.
Has anyone legitimately slapped someone else? Not a play slap, but a good hard 5 fingers across the face?	So you're cousin doesn't like war, and was a bit (ok, a lot) rude about it = you have the right to use violence against him. That's stupid. Use your mouth man.	In the army, during combative training, we had something called slap drill. Basically, get your knees facing someone arms distance away. And slap each other one at a time as hard as you can. Didn't stop until the cadre thought you hit each other as hard as you could. Usually went 6 or 7 rounds until you were done. Then you wrestled to submission. Fucking sucked.
Commuters of Reddit, what tricks would I need to know to get through your commute every morning?	My business is an under one minute walk from my condo, but you can cut that time in half by going through the lobby in tower 65.	I drive about an hour each way, every day. I noticed that it became much better once I just came to peace with it and stopped thinking about how much it sucks. I just listen to the radio/music and let it happen. It's just a fact of life for me now.
What "good advice" do you think is actually bad advice?	Women like nice guys. EDIT: Since this got buried and people are basically disagreeing with me by saying stuff I agree with: > To clarify, I'm not saying they absolutely don't like nice guys. The problem is that women act like all you have to do to get laid is be nice and exist around women and it'll just happen.	My mother gave me some relationship advice once: 'Men are like jobs; don't leave one until you have another one lined up' I think I was 16 when I realised what horrible advice that was.
What's something inconsequential that you have an irrationally strong opinion about?	it's pronounced fucking jif * there are words that start with g and have a soft g sound. giraffe, gyroscope, gin, ginger, geriatric, etc. * in fact, the general rule is if the letter following g is an e, i, or y, it's a soft g, whereas a, o, or u get a hard g * the creator said it's pronounced jif * it doesn't matter that it's "**g**raphics interchange format" because if acronyms took on the pronunciations of the words used to create them, we'd be saying "jayfeg" "scubba" "nahtoh" instead of "jaypeg" "scooba" and "naytoh" * if you pronounce it with a hard G, you are wrong and in denial of reality * in fact you're not just wrong, you're a fucking jackwagon and i hate you edit: if any of you were here i would be punching you in the head, i am so serious about this	Leaving games, cds, dvds, etc outside their case. Especially when I go and see people doing it when they're borrowing from someone else
Skinny people who used to be fat, do you feel that you're treated differently now after the weight loss? How so?	I can honestly say I have never treated anybody differently due to their weight in my life, or treated anybody differently from anything due to their appearance in my life. What the flying fuck is wrong with people, does everyone just treat others as either potential mate or not, are we not more intelligent than this, like holy fucking shit.	People treat me 100% differently now that I've lost over 100 lbs. I'm invited to parties, get togethers, etc. Oh, and you rarely ever get approached by women when you're morbidly obese. I'm not super thin now by any means, I'm still husky. But yes, it's two totally different worlds.
Favorite youtuber that went to shit?	i don't understand this question. do people watch specific people's videos on youtube? like, they know that person and watch all their new videos? am... am i old now?	I'm starting to like Watchmojo a bit less. It feels like the videos will get to the point of "Top Ten Actors who like eating Strawberries" or something like that. EDIT: Oops, one too many "likes." I wrote this and immediately went to bed. Fixed!
Reddit, what's a secret you'll always keep from your SO / Family ?	I don't keep anything from my SO, but as far as my family goes, there is one thing I do keep secret from them. I think that they are all kind of dumb and easily swayed by Fox news. You get the idea.	I can't tell my SO or my family, they all are very sensitive people. For reasons beyond my understanding i can't love people, It's almost like i grew out of it or don't feel as passionate about emotional relations as i once did. Even My SO i don't truly love, she's just like a really fun friend who i enjoy pulling shennanigans with. The only person who i love...truly love is my brother. Maybe because we've been to hell and back and never stopped having each others backs. I can't tell them, it would crush them...not to mention both my parents have doctorates in psychology..they would have a hay day with me. I fell Like i should also add I'm not depressed and i am a very happy and energetic person. I have tons of hobbies and actually enjoy my job! It's like being a robot with missing code.
What was the worst movie/TV show casting decision?	Ed Sheeran in Game of Thrones. It was really jarring and took me out of the show for a bit	Leslie Howard (age 42), Norma Shearer (age 34), and John Barrymore (age 54) as the teenaged main characters in George Cukor's *Romeo and Juliet*.
As a kid what was that one thing that you swear you wouldn't do as an adult but did it when you grew up?	I begged my mom to let me watch The Mummy Returns after she said I couldn't because it had bad words. I promised I wouldn't swear. Until a guy said he got shot in the arse and I immediately repeated it laughing. She heard.	Sit around and just talk to my friends for fun. As a kid, this was one of the most boring things my parents did. I couldn't understand what fun they saw in "catching up" when all they did was sit and talk. As an adult? Best thing ever!
What was your "I am surrounded by idiots" moment?	Any time the right wing tries to make an argument. Try asking for sources and it's like telling an AI "this statement is false".	10+ years ago I was on the cheerleading squad in high school. We had an Indian girl on the squad, and when we introduced ourselves, she jokingly said "I'm so-and-so but most people just know me as 'that Indian chick' " (she was the only Indian student in the whole school... this was rural Virginia). One of the freshman girls looks in awe and asks "ohhhh what tribe?" And the Indian girl responds, "no, I mean I am actually an Indian person" to which another freshman girl replies "yea, but like, what kind?". Again, "No, I am an Indian person, from the country of India". A third freshman girl pipes in, "ok, but which tribe is that?". So many stereotypes confirmed in a single afternoon... I'm not shitting on cheerleaders, I loved cheerleading, we just had a dumb batch that year.
What's the most disgusting thing you've ever found in your house?	On my 28th Birthday I woke up to the cat being sick on my shoulder (love you Loki thanks), went downstairs and immediately stood in another pile of cat sick- stumbled, and stood in orange cat diarrhoea. HAPPY BIRTHDAY.	My wife went to clean a bathroom we don’t normally use to prepare for a guest. She called me in and pointed to a maggot writhing on the toilet seat lid. We lifted the lid and there were more on the seat and about an inch of dead maggots in the bowl. Where did they come from? I looked up and noticed the exhaust fan was right above the toilet. I flipped the switch for the fan and CLING-CLANG-CLING-CLANG maggots start raining down from above. Apparently a bird had died up in the vent and birthed this writhing mass of gray-white stinking devil worms. If the timing had been a little different, our guest could have been sitting on the toilet when...
Redditors, what is something an interviewer did that turned you off from the job?	Tried to get in the local lineworkers union as an apprentice. After doing really well on the admission test I sat at the interview and heard them tell me once in this union I could not do (from what I remember) any electrical work for pay that wasn't union. Their final question was about my criminal history, I was ready to leave at that point so I gave them all my dirt.	Any time the interviewer is more excited about paying to wear jeans for casual Friday than the actual benefits, it’s a bad place to work.
Redditors in mixed-race relationships, what's the worst thing you've had to deal with from ignorant or racist people?	I'm white-hispanic, and my last girlfriend was Japanese. Zero shits were given by anyone, no one ever gave us a bit of trouble. I don't get why so many people still think that being in an interracial relationship (especially a white-asian one) makes you at all edgy. Also, her grandmother, though highly racist, was only racist against Chinese and Koreans. She probably loved me as much as my girlfriend did,	Not really personally, but a good story. I was working at a movie theater and a mixed race couple came in. A black woman and a white man. The woman had on a Vikings jersey (I'm in Minnesota) and the man was wearing a Packers hat. I usually like to small talk with the customers as they buy food. I noticed the team jersey and hat and blurted out "I guess opposites attract, huh?" I immediately knew I had made a huge mistake.
Reddit, what are some ridiculous things you've done for sex?	**PAID** Everytime I have had sex - I have paid - one way or another.... I was once told: "If it flies, floats or fucks - rent it don't buy it" GREAT ADVICE.....	I ran 2 blocks in boxers down a main road o get condom from my buddy. Woke him up by throwing rocks t his window.
Are you comfortable to sit in a bar alone?	Honestly no. I'd feel like an alcoholic if I were at a bar drinking by myself. The whole point of a bar for me is the social aspect (with people that I know, I'm not very outgoing). Without friends there it'd just be me and the drinks, and I can do that at home.	22/f. Absolutely. In a booth by myself, at the bar by myself, you name it. I enjoy hearing other people talk and I like to observe people's interactions with one another. I will not get drunk in a bar by myself, though. Edit: I am so glad that you all think that I'm probably smart.
What's the best or worst thing about having boobs?	Guy here, Worst, I've heard that the bigger they are, the worse they are for daily life, so much so that there's a subreddit for it; /r/bigboobproblems Backpain, hurting if you have the wrong bra/brasize, and so on. Best of course is getting to play with them.	Worst: Cleavage Crumbs after eating and Cleavage Sweat after working out. Best: If they're the right size, you can hide them and then bring them out as a secret weapon. Everyone loves the secretly stacked.
What's something everyone just accepts as normal that's actually completely fucked up when you think about it?	The fact that if our President elect tried to find a job he actually had to apply for and be interviewed by an employer, the best he would be qualified for is Wal-Mart greeter.	This morning, as is tradition, I stuck the top of a pine tree into a plastic angel's ass and then lit it up so we can look at it for a month.
What's something you have done for someone else that they will never know about?	Well, the Onion's *Our Dumb Century* goes back to 1900, so that'll give you a reasonably good idea of what a late 19th century Onion would look like.	My little sister is THE WORST at recognizing when to get over before taking an exit on the highway. She will always be in the outside lane and realize at the last moment she needs to get over, and of course she often can't because there is not break in traffic so she misses her exit. So when we are driving two separate vehicles to the same location I always stay behind her and when we need to exit I get over into the proper lane early and pace myself so there is always a gap right next to her. Then when she suddenly realizes, "Oh shit that's my exit!" there is a space for her to get over safely. I have done this for years and I don't think she realizes that I am consciously doing it.
What can the other sex do that you wish you could?	I'd like to experience a life without gender discrimination being part and parcel of every nuance of the day, in both overt and covert ways. I'd like to experience life without periods. I'd like to experience life with understanding that people feel and express things in different ways, and to have the corresponding forgiveness immediately given to me when I make mistakes or am under pressure, rather than being branded forever "an emotional woman/a bad manager/an aggressive woman wanting to be like a man" and so on.	Pee off cliffs. I recently did a hiking trip through the desert. Enormous craters, isolated springs, real beautiful scenery. As we were walking along a particularly high trail at the edge of a cliff, I noticed a male friend unleashing a golden trail into the abyss, and I realized he was living the dream.
What fictional bad guy or villain do you actually like?	Zoom Reverse Flash Savitar Hoffman from Saw. Captain Cold Heat Wave Cardinal Richeleu Pennywise Magneto Shredder Hans Gruber Voldemort Wilson Fisk The Red Skull Obadiah Stane	Predator They have a loose moral code of not attacking if you do not have a weapon/handicapped/Pregnant. They only want the trophy/hunt not to just kill you.
What's your favorite insult that isn't used as often as it should?	Someone pulled out in front of me as I was entering a gas station, causing me to almost hit him. For some reason, I came up with "CUNTNIGGER!"	If you were any more inbred, you'd be a sandwich. My personal favourite, bar none. I only break it out on special occasions.
What achievement are you most proud of that no one really cares?	My kids are really tall. I mean, I know I didn't do anything but contribute some DNA and provide adequate nutrition, but I'm really proud of how tall they are. I feel sorry for people with scrawny kids.	When I was a senior in high school, I wrote an essay on fellowship in class that compared my own experience in theater to that of the Fellowship of the Ring, which had just come out on DVD, for a Time magazine contest. All my peer reviews told me they didn't like it and to rewrite it, but I kept it and submitted it. I won runner up nationally. My teacher gave me 5 points extra credit and anyone I tried to talk to about it just stared at me blankly. But damn am I still proud of that.
Fast food workers of Reddit, what should we NOT order at your restaurant? And why?	McDonald’s. Everything on the menu is pretty okay but don’t take a job there, the staff are such fucking assholes. But tbf that might be because how rude some of the customers are. Ever wanna see how shitty people can be? Go work the McDonald’s drive through. Edit: This was in a UK McDonald’s	Current Wendy's employee here. Don't be the ass that orders a T-Rex Burger (a 9, 4 oz patty burger). First of all, they are basically a one way ticket to the emergency room. Second, we can barely wrap that thing without it falling over since it's so tall. Lastly, go spend the $20 that the sandwich costs on food that's actually worth a damn. Still amazes me when people order that shit
What is the most unfortunate name you have ever heard?	Femalè will always be a name I remember from my mother's time in Atlanta. Junkie (pronounced jun nike) is another.	I grew up in South Africa, and a lot of the non-English speaking tribal people used to name their children with English words that they thought sounded beautiful, whether they knew what the word meant or not. Anyway, long story short, I had a friend whose parents had a maid named Vagina.
When was a time when the thought "I'm going to die right now" went through your head?	When a good friend and I stopped talking because of something I said, I closed my eyes and prayed for a painless death.	Told this story a couple of times...Was at a party, some guy on PCP was there that known of us knew. He started freaking out and pulled a gun out and pointed it directly at my head from about 4 feet away...He pulled the trigger and some how missed..Some people tackled him down and called the cops, and I sat in a corner crying and puking for the next hour.
What’s your best One Night Stand story?	Sorry my English is so suck Me my roommate in dorm. We drink what give in bar. Roommate say I can no stand in corner in night. I say I do. I stand in corner. I am weak. I sit on knee. Roommate say I don't Not night but hour	Like 12 years ago I messaged this girl on POF. We talked for like an hour(she lived like 1hr away from me) at like 1am she asks if she can come over. She drove and got to my place at like 2am. We did the deed and fell asleep. I woke up the next morning and she was gone. I went into my kitchen to get some golden grahams and there is a knock on my door. I open it and there she is with coffee and a box of donuts. She hands them to me and tells me she has to go to work. We never talked again
What's the most pain you've ever been in?	An emotional relationship that I had for 4 years with my SO who I thought I was my soul mate. We’re on break rn and just hearing the possibility of being left alone like that has me broken with physical pain.	A sneeze. I've been shot (once), stabbed (twice), had gall stones, kidney stones, and pancreatitis, but that sneeze was the worst. I had open heart surgery (congenitally bad heart valve). They gave me a little pillow and told me to hug it tight if I felt a sneeze coming on. I thought they were crazy but kept it close. Next day, sneezed without warning. I ceased to exist as a person. The universe and all in it ceased to exist. Reality was a single point of formless, featureless pain, exquisite in its purity, unparalleled in its intensity.
Surgeons and tattoo artists of Reddit - if you're the former, have you ever had to really ruin someone's tattoo to perform surgery, and if you're the latter, how did you fix it? Was the person mad?	I had surgery on my hand and wrist last year, and my boyfriend is a tattoo artist. He won't tattoo my hand and wrist (at least for now) because of the complexities - 1) It's just a harder area in general 2) I already have a shitty tattoo on my hand that he'd have to cover up 3) I have a big scar and apparently that's another hard thing and 4) There's a bunch of metal holding my bones together in that area. So for now, he's going to tattoo a more standard area (thigh - he drew me up a zebra, appropriately) and eventually I'll convince him to tackle my screwed up hand/wrist.	A family friend of mine had his foot blown off in Iraq. The doctors had to amputate slightly above what was left of his ankle. When the doctor showed him the line where they would be cutting, it went right through the tattoo he had on the side of his leg. He told the doctor, "you're not leaving me with half a tattoo, cut higher". So they did.
You have the chance to own any fictional item, what do you take?	Marauder's map. A lot of the things being said would totally be taken for studying or whatever random reasons but the map wouldn't be and I'll tell you why. Because you know where everyone is! You could be the best criminal in the world and even if the cops knew it was you they would still not be able to get you if you know where EVERYONE is. Or you could be a bad ass hero that can find any missing person ever.	Genies lamp from Aladdin. Use the first two wishes to get literally whatever I want and free him with the third because he's Robin Williams.
To anyone who has dated / been married to a twin that has passed away, how does it feel seeing the other twin still alive?	It was really hard losing her. She was always so perfect and always knew how to make me feel the way I wanted. The twin is nearly identical but everything about her seems to be lopsides, so it never feels entirely the same when I made the switch. Mary Palmer, you are severely missed but Betty Right is almost as good.	My father is/was a twin. My uncle died when I was 12. They couldn't have been more opposite personality wise but were identical. The only thing that made them different is my dad's beard. He's had it my whole life and people often joke "oh he should totally shave", "that would be totally crazy". Once a few years ago my little sister got pushy and kept pressuring my Dad to cut it all off. My father teared up and said "It's hard enough seeing him in the mirror every day".
when a cop pulls you over, and asks "do you know why I've pulled you over?" what is the correct response?	Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low. Do I look like a mind reader sir? I don't know.	"No, officer." They write everything that you say on the back of the citation, and refer to it in court. Say nothing, and there is nothing to recite.
What's the worst hygiene you have seen in a person?	I had been dating this girl for a few months. One day she tells me, in an off hand way, that her gynecologist told her that she had E. coli growing on her cervix. She seemed totally unconcerned about having poop in her vag, and got extremely hostile at the suggestion that she should possibly wipe in another direction. She absolutely refused to do anything to improve her hygiene because it is "nobody's business". The worst part was that she loved getting oral, probably more than any other girl I ever dated. But not after that. She was a third year university student majoring in Chemistry, it's not like she was some uneducated person. Did you just throw up in your mouth a little?	I have a student who does not wipe their ass, who has had lice multiple times, who has jagged, long and filthy nails, who always has a dirty skin. Yes, cps has been called multiple times, and yes, nothing has changed.
After my girlfriend and I came back from our vacation celebrating our 2 year anniversary, she told me she cheated on me for the 2nd time during the vacation. When did you realize you wanted to leave your significant other?	For me, it'd have to be the time where I had gone to a party with some friends and eaten a hash cookie (I wasn't a stranger to edibles by any means, and my significant other and I partook relatively often) that turned out to be laced with PCP. The minute I realized that something was very, very wrong, I texted my long-distance boyfriend saying that I was scared and trying to say what happened. Long story short, he didn't reply for almost twelve hours, and when he did, he wasn't even particularly concerned. It was so different from how I would have reacted, had the tables been turned, that it made me realize that we probably weren't a good match for each other.	The moment I found out the protection I'd been using with her actually worked just fine, that she was actually pregnant to someone else, and it wasn't my fault she had HIV- because I'm clean.
What question are you afraid to ask?	Not really a question, but I'm afraid to seem like a pedophile when I say that I just want to see some child porn once, just to see what all the hubbub is about. I'm a 19 year old, fairly attractive female with a boyfriend. It's not like I'm a basement dweller. A person can be curious, jeez.	Do you love me as much as I do? Edit: Do you love me as much as I love you?
What’s the dumbest thing you got in trouble for in school?	In high school: Drinking Cazadores Reposado tequilla in the library for fun and I got caught. Lol I got a 3 day suspension, but my parents were cool and let me go to the movie theaters for those 3 days. Best suspension ever!	My teacher once asked us to write down our favorite thing to do. I wrote “sleeping with my mom”. This resulted in a meeting with my parents. I was in 2nd grade...I obviously just meant cuddling and taking a nap. My mom thought that the teacher was insane.
What is a cliché movie scene that you witnessed in real life?	So my bestfriend Autumn is crazy and its okay because I still love her and all her weirdness but I was in my class just minding ny own buisness and she sneaks into my class goes under the table and sits in the chair infront of me but im on my phone so i dont notice shes their i think to myself ohh i kinda miss Autumn i wonder where she is and i look up and bam shes right there and then she scared me because i was in shock that she just fuckin magically teleported infront of me basically	After flying into Mesa, AZ I noticed an entire family welcoming home their daughter/sister from college. They had a banner and everything. The second she walked out from the terminal her younger sister (I'm assuming) sprinted at her and jumped up for a hug and absolutely fucking mauled her. They both hit the floor with a thud. I shared some hysterical laughs with an enterprise worker.
What is something you learned recently that you wish you learned 10 years ago?	It's centrist (and racist) to ban guns. Supporting an armed citizenry is part of leftist philosophy. Rich people will always have access to physical protection whether guns are legal or not, so the greater populace deserves access too. Armed folks are harder to oppress.	I learned I have spent over 100,000 dollars in 10 years on alcohol and tobacco alone. This does not include other endeavors i have done in the past weed etc.
For those of you that are in stock photos, where was the weirdest place you saw your picture used?	My sister's friend's cousin's girlfriend's mum's friend's nephew was in a photo of some sort that was used to represent some sort of product somewhere.	My friend had a zombie wedding photoshoot a few years back and she asked me to shovel some cake in my mouth with my bare hands. The picture was later featured in an article about asexuality, and the title was something like "Asexuality: Having your cake and eating it too". Definitely a weird picture choice...
Left handed people of Reddit, what is the hardest thing to find for your left handed needs?	Nothing. I can do anything with my left that the rest of you do with your right. I use a regular computer mouse in my left hand , just put my index finger on the left side of it, I use regular scissors in my left hand with no trouble- and I am a hairstylist and use my shears (non-left handed ones) in my left hand. What's odd is, I catch a ball with a baseball mitt either left or right, can throw left or right, and play hockey as a right handed person does. I'm weird. Haha	Sweeping with a broom from the left side usually unscrews the broom head. Power tools - Drills, circular saws, grinders, etc etc. Can't read the numbers on measuring cups People asking me how I write all weird. Painfully and messily.
What was your 'why the fuck would you tell me that?' moment?	As a black person, you'll encounter the occasional white person who thinks it's okay to drop the N-bomb on you with little to no warning, whether it's to make a point, recite a song lyric, or do an impression. Usually it's because they got away with it with one black person or another black person in their life allows them to say it, as if there's some sort of Black Person Bulletin Board (BBB) or database where black people post the names of white people who have been granted permission to say the N-word by an official moderator of aforementioned website. "Oh my bad for getting offended, guess I haven't logged on in awhile" Sorry, white people, what will get you a laugh on one block WILL STILL get your head ripped off in another. Tread very carefully.	Dentist said to me, "Sorry if I seem off, I just accidentally cut my last patients gums. I need to get more sleep."
In honour of Move-In Day, RAs of Reddit, what’s the worst parent/student separation you’ve seen?	And yet when my son went in the service it was 'drop him off at the recruiting office and say goodbye'	Mom thought she would be able to live with her daughter in the dorms. Upon being told that wasn't possible, she withdrew the daughter, and they both went back home.
Camp counselors, what's the most NSFW thing you've caught campers doing?	Why the fuck is every top thread in this shitty subreddit about sex or NSFW shit, like seriously? A bunch of virgins asking for fap material.	I walked in to my cabin once and this kid (He was like 12 or 13) Was just standing with his dick on the table. Not jacking off or doing anything just literally standing there, with his dick resting on the table, staring at the door.
What is changing about you the older you get?	I actually did get more conservative. I'm still in favor of most liberal ideas: social safety nets and equality, etc. But the regressive left I think is fucking stupid, third wave feminism has serious integrity issues that are anathema for the left to even discuss, and when you use gender options to feel special or silence descent you've gone too far / full retard. College me would have blindly followed or ignored the above.	My hips and back hurt more often and I give less and less of a shit about what other people think of me.
You can sell your IQ points for $500,000/point. How many do you sell and what do you do with the money?	I've got enough, I could easily part with about 10 and net a cool 5 mil. Early retirement in my mid-30s. edit because all of you apparently don't get it: we're talking like 120 to 110 here. That wouldn't affect your life significantly, but 5 million certainly would	Hell I'd just sell the one. $500,000 would be life-changing money for me. All of my debt would be gone and I could afford a pretty nice house in my city.
What lie are you currently living and do you have a plan to address it?	I’ve been in a relationship with someone I really do love for the past 5 years... but she’s a whole “wait till marriage”type person and I’m dying to get any action... sadly I’ve had a slew of slip ups with other girls. Probably never gonna tell her tho.	My husband left a year ago I haven’t told my family. My kids and I live Day to day in a state of numbness. I honestly don’t know how to address it because there was no explanation.
What is one thing you hoard?	Would the difference between hoarding and collecting be that hoarding doesn't serve or satisfy a purpose? I mean, I collect records but I wouldn't say that I hoard them. However I most definitely hoard the empty envelopes of every piece of mail I have. I also refuse to throw out any electronics cables I've come across throughout the years, so I have a massive rat's nest of them in a drawer under my bed.	Note books, you never know when you might get a good idea that you should write down but you don't because that would spoil the note book
What is your worst Reddit experience so far?	This election, as a Republican voter on Reddit. Apparently, I'm an Idiot, moron, bigot. Someone better tell my Hispanic girlfriend (who also voted Trump).	There have probably been worse ones that I don't know about, but a couple of accounts ago, there was an askreddit thread where everyone took a photo out their front door and posted it. Which I did. And someone was outrageously offended by an ordinary photo out my front door. You could see my mailbox, the street, my neighbor's hedges, that's it. He (I'm assuming it was a "he") replied to my photo with a rant that started with, "I call bullshit!" and then went on and on about how that couldn't possibly be a photo out my front door. It's been several years. I hope he got the help he needed.
In what ways did your parents screw up when raising you?	My parents were determined to do the right thing at all costs and, in trying to achieve the impossible, they fought all the time. My mom had a lion of a temper and would physically attack my dad and even took it out on me at times. My mom was a man-hating, neo-hippie feminist who was constantly ready to fight the world and my dad was a heavily bearded ex stoner with a doctorate, a slight case of aspergers and a whole lot of PTSD from Vietnam. By the time I got to high school, I was a very angry kid - angry at authority, angry at the government, angry at my parents - and it stayed with me until today, though I have a much more intellectual view on my emotions these days. I know there is much worse out there, but it screwed me up just the same.	Sorry to hear that. My mom was like that too, so I can understand. One of the things that still affects me is how my mom tried to protect me from everything. She wouldn't let me do things that I wanted (art, writing, football...) because she thought I would fail or get hurt. I still struggle with self-esteem issues. I never think I'm going to win or succeed. I usually quit before I try.
Men of Reddit, how do you explain your haircut to your barber?	Skin fade on side on 0 to 1, cut the split ends on the top. Yes I have a man bun.	Went into a "salon" yesterday, and showed them a picture. I said that I wanted it to look like that, and the picture had the perfect length I was looking for. The "stylist" told me that she could cut my hair like that, but it might not look exactly the same because our faces were different... it was a picture of me.
What’s an unspoken rule where you’re from?	All white men who interact with children are probably child molesters. We won't talk to them, just watch with suspicion and make them feel bad about themselves.	It's technically illegal to save a parking spot, but god help you if you try to park in a spot someone shoveled out and saved with lawn chairs.
What innocent question that someone asked you, crushed you a little?	so unlike my sister , i don’t like wearing my skirt all the way down to my knees. i’ll wear it mid thigh and we’re out in public and she goes “why do you wear your skirt so short? do you like other people seeing your butt?” and i kinda crushed because i felt like a whore even though my sisters only 10	“Table for how many?” the first time we went out for dinner after my Dad completed suicide. That one hit like a truck.
To those who take more than 3 minutes to take a shit, what the hell are you doing in there?	I take anywhere from 5m-15 minutes. I poop about 3x an hour. Sometimes it comes out right away, other times i have to let it come out on its own. I have problems :(	It takes me forever to wipe my ass. I don't even know where the shit keeps coming from, but sure enough, with every wipe it's still not clean yet. I envy anyone who can shit in under 10 minutes.
[Serious] Bullies of reddit whose victims committed suicide, how did it affect you?	In contrast to the majority here i honestly dont feel that bad, i dont think about much wont do any good dwelling on it	Let's also hold a candle for those who were bullied continually, but didn't go through with suicide. Perhaps they were slightly tougher, or didn't quite reach the lowest point by a hair's breadth, or found an escape in books or computers. Those who now passing through their twenties and beyond are suffering from continued depression, unable to hold down jobs or motivate themselves or form relationships, still hating themselves and having crushed self esteem and social phobias. Some may recover. Others, suicide may simply have been delayed.
At what subreddit would I get guaranteed downvotes by saying a specific sentence?	/r/lewronggeneration : Drake is the greatest rapper of all time, A Day in the Life sucks, What is a metallica, etc. PRetty easy to piss them off.	/r/LearnJapanese "konichiwa guys can i learn japanese by watching anime my friend did that so i was just wondering arigato gosamas" Downvotes will be served. Definitely.
Science teachers of reddit, what're the strangest hypotheses your students have devised?	Not exactly the same thing but I constantly ask my teacher the craziest questions. Like last week i asked if the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle's in Michael Bay's movie were scientifically accurate. Specifically if normal turtles had toxic waste poured on them if they'd randomly need glasses and/or grow noses	After measuring the mass and volume of several wooden blocks in order to calculate their density, one student concluded that the color of an object determines whether it floats or sinks. The denser blocks happened to be dark color wood. Never mind all the measurements and calculations they did, the whole lab was actually about color. This was a college geology course.
Do you care if your girlfriend shaves their legs?	Your boyfriend is just being nice. Do him a favor, shave. At the same token, don't feel bad asking him to change either.	I totally understand that body hair removal is a matter of personal preference for both genders; we all have things that we find appealing or unappealing. However, I am absolutely baffled by the notion that a woman's unshaven legs are "unhygienic", or that women who don't shave are "dirty" or don't care about their appearance. I shave about once a week because I have very sensitive skin, and my skin gets very irritated if I try to do it more often than that, and my pubic area is neatly trimmed but not shaved. I take pride in my appearance, I am clean, and I smell nice. Leg hair has never once been an impediment to my hygiene or cleanliness. Men have leg hair, and that certainly does not make them dirtier or smellier! So like what you like, but don't label a chick who doesn't shave as dirty.
What common misconception about your job would you like to clear up?	Stay at home mom: The majority of my day is not spent sitting on my butt doing nothing. The majority of my day is chasing my two year old around the house, cleaning up her messes, cleaning the house, cooking, shopping (for groceries and household stuff, rarely for myself), and making/going to appointments. Yes, there are some days when my child has decided to just relax and we watch movies together and be lazy...but that does not occur as often as you may think.	Private Chef (I work in people's homes, usually when they're not home); I always behave like there's a camera on me. I don't look through people's stuff, talk to friends about clients' private lives/living conditions/finances, and if at all possible, I only use the restroom closest to the kitchen so I don't have to walk to other parts of the house.
Are there words/terms in German that have been fundamentally tainted by the Nazis and have therefore fallen into disuse?	Accusing the Jews of anything now makes you an evil Nazi. Jews now have free reign to rule the world.	"SS" as abbreviation for something. I just came about some thread were people talked about their SS cards and had one of those "the fuck you guys talking about" moments. Or 88, used in Nazi circles to symbolise Heil Hitler (H = 8th letter in the abc). Makes it difficult for the poor gamers born in 1988 who want to add their birthyear to their nick.
People of Reddit, what is your "Holy shit he/she wasn't lying" moment?	The hooker was teasing me about how it was her first day and she'd never let a man take her before. Then... I popped her cherry and realized she hadn't lied.	A professor friend of mine casually dropped that he was a founding member of Gaelic Storm and was (briefly) in the movie Titanic. I knew he played the bódhran (Irish drum). I had been a GS fan for years, including playing their song in high school marching band in 2001. My friend is a bit of a rogue so I was sure it was a joke, but then I looked at my old album covers and Wikipedia and holy shit, he really was a founding member!
What is a popular thing that you just don't understand how people can get into it/like it?	Being a sjw.. It must be exhausting to be on the constant look out for the next thing to offend you because it's offensive to someone else	Reality talent/singing television shows. I realize people enjoy them and I respect that but dang. They are so stagged, over dramatized, and on like 4 nights a week.
I have a big hermit crab living inside a jar in my garden. How can I help him?	Get a small bowl and put a sponge in it if you want to give him water. Paint his shell to make him look cooler then all the other Hermit Crabs in the area. edit: really I get down graded for that comment? what a bunch of softies today.	I re-homed a small hermit crab on beach in Thailand once. I saw him running about and watched him for a while, and then noticed a shell that looked just like his, except a bit bigger, so I put it next to him and he had a good sniff (or whatever hermit crabs do) and then he suddenly scuttled from the old shell to the new one. I felt something like I imagine a parent does on seeing their child grow up. It was awesome. I then went back to floating in the Andaman Sea thinking about how the little hermit crabs would think I was some kind of God. TL;DR I was a herbit crab realtor in Thailand.
A lady was offended when I didn't look at her daughter today, what ridiculous things have strangers said to you?	I would have responded with "I'd probably tap that, but I wouldn't be too excited about it" and left quickly before they came to their senses. If you can do these things and then exit the scene fast enough, you can usually get away with it. I encourage you to try this kind of thing in real life.	In a bar, I was standing in line waiting to be served by the bartender. Just spacing out, hands in my pockets, waiting for my turn. 2 guys are behind me in line. One comes up to me acting angry and says "Did you steal his wallet?" pointing to his friend. I look around thinking he CAN'T be talking to me. And he repeats himself "Did you take his wallet?". I said "How could I take his wallet? I have both hands in my pockets and you guys have been standing behind me!?" He replies, "Well you better not try!". Then they wander off to another part of the bar.
[SERIOUS] People who did not learn to read or write until you were an adult, what was it like living in such a literary heavy world? What was the adjustment like?	I love how OP lets his racism show by just assuming that all illiterate people are black and speak ebonics.	American living in China here, it is difficult. I have tried to learn Mandarin, but my 40yo brain does not retain anything. Meanwhile, my daughter that was 10 when we moved here 3 years ago is pretty much fluent to the extent that she can even read and write the characters. Sorry for the double post.
Reddit, what are your pet peeves in a relationship?	me "Calm down" my wife who I love dearly "I AM FUCKING CALM" me "Keep telling yourself that" And somehow I'm the asshole in that conversation.	"Stop yelling at me!" I'm not yelling at you. My voice isn't even remotely raised. I'm speaking in a calm, even tone. I just happen to be disagreeing with you and you don't like that.
What advice do you have for a 16 year old?	Don't touch any form of drugs. This INCLUDES vaping, weed (even if it is legal), alcohol, ETC. &#x200B; No, consuming them doesn't make you "cool"	There will be many times in your life when you will be discouraged from doing something because you should have started sooner. Always know that, no matter when you start, 5 years down the road, you'll be glad you did it. Saving, exercise, learning to cook, dancing, guitar, rock climbing, journaling...whatever.
What's the smartest thing you've witnessed your pet do?	When he'd hand me a 7/8" wrench even though I asked for a 9/16" because he knows how Fords are made.	I had taken my german shepherd out for a hike in an abandoned conservation area. It was a hot day, there was a creek with a deep pool, so I decided to strip nekkid and go for a swim. The dog and I splashed around a bit, then we got out, I pulled on my clothes, and carried on down the trail. My dog, however, wouldn't follow. She was starting at something in the grass. I called, she looked up at me and then looked back at the grass. I went over to see what was so enthralling... turns out my car keys had fallen out of my pocket and she wasn't budging until I picked them up.
Do you feel guilt after killing insects? Why or why not?	Yes. We have a rule in my house that we don't kill any insects. We can move them outside, but we don't kill them. Who are we to decide what lives and dies? (I'm also a vegetarian). I'll just leave this quote here from Rachel Carson's 'Silent Spring', “Who has the right to decide that the supreme value is a world without insects even though it would be a sterile world ungraced by the curving wing of a bird in flight. The decision is that of the authoritarian temporarily entrusted with power.”	If they're outside and not bothering me...yes. It is their home. If they're in my house, no I feel no remorse.
In high school I told my friend not to marry his girlfriend right after graduation. After one year of marriage he got divorced. Have you ever tried to warn somebody of a bad decision, and they did it anyway?	I warn my wife about things everyday, and every fucking day, she does the opposite, fucks up, takes no responsibility, and I pick up the pieces. As soon as I get my daughter through college, im killing myself...until then, I'm drinking	I once told my friend to not jump down a flight of steps barefoot because he would break his ankle. Guess what he did... And guess what happened...
What's something you never understood until you experienced it first hand?	White Privilege. I always understood that it systematically made it easier for me to get through life, and therefore thought I understood it. But those are things you never really see. Since they can't actually manifest in front of you its easy to say they don't exist, or just take them fore granted like I had been. Then when I actually experienced white privilege and saw it in front of me was when I understood how much it exists in my life. Which was a lot more then I had previously thought.	Why people whine about being constipated, I mean, so what? Right? Wrong. It's a terrible, horrible thing to have to endure. The bloating, pressure and cramping force you into fondly reminiscing about your last glorious pooping session. It got to the point that I didn't even want to eat anymore for fear the traffic jam would breach borders I didn't want breached.
If you could give any advice to a teenager for future life, what would it be?	If you plan on going to college, don't date anyone until you get there. It's even better to wait until your junior or senior year. That's when you finally are who you will be for the rest of your life.	Keep track of your incomes and expenses. If you want something now, wait a day with it. If you still want it, you can start.considering buying it.
What is the strangest thing that's happened to you for which there is no explanation?	Once I ordered a Venus Flytrap from a nursery. When I went there to pick it up there was an old man running the place who took me into the back to show me where he kept them. There were a few hundred plants and he said I could pick whichever one I wanted but I better be careful because if I picked wrong there would be consequences. I kind of thought it was weird so I shrugged it off and picked one I liked. He screamed out, "Wrong!!" And suddenly his mentally retarded son burst in carrying a white hot nickel in some tongs. He threw it on my back and burned the everloving shit out of me, laughing like a maniac.	When i was around 7 years old i used to have this recurring dream of being on my bed with a friend who was this girl in a white onesie. We did all sorts of kiddy things together like play clapping games and have tea parties. The funny thing was, whenever i woke up in the morning she was gone but i was always wearing whatever i had on in the "dream" and i remember this one time we played monopoly and when i woke up, somehow i had my monopoly set up on the bed and while some of the cards n stuff while were slightly out of place, the money count and amount of houses n stuff were the same as it was when we played in my dream. I stopped seeing her after we moved houses and i never really thought about her since.
Parents of ugly children, when did you finally admit it to yourself and how has it impacted you?	No parents see their children as ugly. Source: My sister thought my niece was the most beautiful baby alive and wanted to put her forward as a baby model. Only now when we look back she realised she was pretty odd looking and pulled some strange expressions. Sort of looked like a worried old man.	I always wanted to believe my son would be perfect... but then again I look like a California raisin so I don't know what was I supposed to expect.
What would you think of Buzzfeed having to pay us r/AskReddit users royalties for using our answers and questions in order to write clickbait articles?	While I am certain it will never happen, it does only seem fair. I've had some of my own comments end up on various sites and I certainly did not agree to that.	I've had two of my comments randomly show up on Facebook clickbait. I don't want royalties, but I see it as ultra lazy "content" far lower on my totem pole than simple Reddit reposts.
I used to think when a black person and a white person had a baby they made a mexican person. Reddit, what messed up things did you believe to be true as a child?	I believed that a mythical man in the sky could see me at all times; furthermore I felt like he was judging me on my every movement.	I used to believe that people who died in movies were people who wanted to commit suicide and wanted to be useful at the same time. I thought it was an honorable decision and I had no problems watching it.
What were some unintended negative consequences of the internet?	SJW's. I know they have always been around in some respect but the internet gave them a soap box for every little thing.	Public shaming. We might think it's all well and good when some dickhead gets his comeuppance on social media or the internet at large, but most of the time the response is disproportionate to the offence committed, and lasts far far longer.
[Serious] Have you ever stumbled across pornography featuring someone you know? If so, who was it and how did you feel about it?	There was this girl... we flirted often in high school. I never pulled the trigger bkuz she always had a boyfriend. so as the time went by we always engaged in playful banter but that was the extent of our relationship. fast forward 3 years... I stumble across a website for glory holes. as I'm scrolling down the page I see it. the girl I often fantasized about... taking a dick from a hole in a partition. .. instantly I showed all my friends and she became known as 'GLORY' after that.	I grew up in Miami so this occurs quite often, at least once a year. The first time it happened was when we were seniors in high school and it spread like wild fire. After a few times it just became something along the lines of "Dude she's smoking hot! Send me the link!".
What are some good, productive or polite things people do that actually annoy you?	when people say 'God Bless You' when I sneeze, even though it is considered common courtesy it bugs the crap out of me. It originated in the dark ages because people thought it was the sound of your soul leaving your body and saying bless you would reverse it. Also, I'm an atheist.	"(X) was looking a little messy so I cleaned it up for you!" IT WAS ORGANIZED CHAOS AND NOW I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING
What is your strangest "it's a small world" story?	Living in the Bornean jungle In 27 years I only meet one person, turns out he was from the same town I had left behind all those years ago, and I'd known his dad. He had no clue about the 12 people I murdered back in Australia though.	Live in Australia in a town of pop.3600. Travel to the Bornean jungle and meet the only white fella there who has been volunteering and living there for 27 years. He came from the same town. He knew my dad. Asked my Dad about him: Apparently he committed some crimes crimes which the town hounded him about, he disappeared never to be seen again. I found him.
Which careers ARE portayed accurately in movies?	IT workers. Smart people in their field that scoff at those who aren't proficient, and every one I've met really does seem oblivious to just how disconnected they are to social realities. Edit: I knew lots of IT people are on Reddit - it's pretty overrepresented on here, which isn't surprising. And that's why we use the throwaway! :D	Rock star. Many real-life rockers, including David Lee Roth and Steven Tyler, have said that they either hated *This Is Spinal Tap* or didn't find it funny at all, since it was too uncomfortably close to what their real lives were like.
Straight people of Reddit, what questions do have for LGBT+ Redditors?	None at all. Feel free to do what you please in the privacy of your own home. No one really cares.	Ok answer me this. I don't really consider myself gay but man do I like looking at dick. Like I really like it but the rest of the male body is kinda meh to me. Women on the other hand I love everything about. Am I in denial?
My friend witnessed a rejected public marriage proposal last night... which ultimately became a break-up. What are some of your worst moments of second-hand embarrassment Reddit?	I'm sorry, but if someone proposed to me at a sporting event I would say no too. He deserved it.	Back when I used to play hockey, I must have been about 10, this kid on the other team got the puck for what appeared to be the first time ever. He was in the neutral zone, but on his team's side of the red line. He turns around and skates towards his own goalie. THe goalie didn't realize what was going on, so when the kid went and took a shot, the goalie didn't try at all to stop it... kid got what was probably the only goal of his hockey career, on his own net. Made only more embarrassing by the huge to do over whether or not they should count it for our team, just lingering on the idea of his traitorous goal rather than letting the game get on and forget it.
Deaf people of Reddit, what is your alarm clock?	I'm not deaf and I don't need an alarm clock to wake up. I'm guessing it's the same for some too.	deaf here, I've used a Sonic Alert alarm clock for years, it has a bed shaker and is probably loud enough to wake the dead. Can find them on amazon for like 30 bucks, hands down one of the loudest alarm clocks I've never heard.
Bartenders of Reddit, who is your saddest customer?	The one undesirable looking female in a group of mostly single girls... Especially on new years eve. New year's is always a shit show of drama, fighting, and vomit. But for the girl left behind it's especially rough to watch. Most of time groups of girls that come to my bar are looking out for each other. If one girl drinks too much or isn't having a good time then at least one friend will take care of it. Unfortunately on new years everyone (guys included) becomes massively selfish pricks. Inevitably I end up with 2 or 3 unattractive girls trying to tequila away the fact that her friends ditched them to make out with some stranger.	We have a couple that used to come in 3-4 times a week. They both drank Wild Turkey 101 and water. She was always a hot mess everytime they came in and the husband kind of kept her in check. Come to find out he was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer with a very low survival rate. Against all odds apparently he was doing a lot better after going through a round of chemo. About two weeks ago he forgot to take his blood clot medication and had a massive stroke and passed away. She has been coming in by herself during the day drinking since his death. Just found out a couple days ago she was leaving the bar and hit another vehicle, charged with DUI personal injury, property damage, and is still in jail.
Redditors who used to be messy but now keep their house/apartment/car/etc clean, what caused you to finally change and how did you do it?	Graduated college, got a job making more than my housekeeper. Oh and my husband finally finished paying child support. More disposable cash. (Yes we save more than we spend on this) I hired someone 3 hours weekly. She does all the deep dirty shit and it makes it easier to keep up the other stuff. Also, the kids are old enough now they know better and I will make contact with them and a broom so they do their part. The lady we hired does the main house and bathrooms. We do our own bedrooms and laundry and still tidy up. We also have her come before company, or a party to get a bit deeper-into the crevasses.	I got a better handle on my mental health. I realized how much happier I feel when things are clean, and also what caused the executive dysfunction that made me messy. I'm still not perfect. I'm still disorganized. But it's a whole lot cleaner than I used to be.
What things do you hate having to fake care about?	I seriously hate being forced to pretend I care about politically correct issues. If you're fat it's because you eat too much, if you're poor it's because you don't try hard enough, if you're disabled, well that sucks for you, but you're not special because you can't do something. If you're a woman you can be sexist, if you're black you can be racist, if you're a prude well that doesn't mean everyone else has to be. People are so fucking sensitive about everything these days. It's exhausting having a conversation with anyone or around anyone.	The lives of my coworkers. I don't care how your weekend was, or what your kid did. Get out of my cube and let me work/reddit.
What's the biggest fuck-up you've made at work that was completely your fault?	Not me, but a co-worker and good friend of mine used to be a tanker. Like, an Abrams tank. They told him to order a part for the tank. Being the new, dumb private, he grabbed the wrong NSN and ordered a whole new tank. Burnt through the year's budget in 5 minutes. Needless to say, they took it out of his ass	Tore a front bumper off a mini van I was towing right in front of the whole family watching me unload their van. I felt awful, but they were understanding and we fixed it for them, plus fixed the reason it was broken down as well since it was a cheap/easy fix.
What weird/fun things do you do when you're stuck in the airport?	Every time I go to the airport I pretend I am a member of a cult with bizarre religious practices. One time I was a member of a cult whose god was a snake. All I did was slither through the airport.	I play the "see how much I can drink and still be allowed to board the plane" game. I've only lost once.
How is your "friend" an asshole?	My neighbor is an asshole; literally everything he says is bullshit. Just a constant stream of liquid excrement every time I see him. And he doesn't even try to remember my name he just calls me "dick". Oh, and don't get me started on my other neighbors! I swear they're nuts.	On the day before our exam i wanted him to return one of my books. He came to my house to study but left the book behind because it was "too heavy". It had 60 pages.
Non-American Redditors, here in the States we have urban legends like alligators in the NYC sewers and the Bunny Man of Virginia, what are some urban legends in your countries?	Here in Germany there is a legend that tons of black people come out at night and ra... OH RIP	It is not really well known, but in some places in Northern-Norway there is a story about a old lady that drives a really old Volvo on rural stretches at night and helps people that have been in car accidents or have trouble with the car, and after helping them she and the car disappears without a trace
Olive Garden servers...How much "free salad and breadsticks" have you seen a customer consume in one sitting?	For me at places like that I treat it more like a side dish. Keep it coming every time it becomes empty there better be a full one replacing it!	Dear lord. I had a party of 30-35 people and it was a soccer team and their parents. We had to make 20+ trays of breadsticks just because of the table (they were eating so many that we couldn't keep up lol) and salads were completely backed up. We brought out initially 7 5 person salads and had about 10 refills.
Whenever I see a "scary" thread, it ends up being about ghosts and whatnot. That's not scary. I find real people more strange and eerie than the "paranormal". What are you scariest encounters with real people?	When i was 11 I was walking to the bus stop when a man walked out of the apartment block behind me and began following me. He wore a hat and looked at the ground as if trying to hide his face. I started walking faster and then began to run, he did the same. He grabbed me from behind and I started crying. I said "what do you want?" and he said "I need about tree fiddy" and thats when I knew I had been tricked by the loch ness monster.	My sister's bedroom was on the second floor. all of a sudden she screamed and said she saw a hand on her window. we thought she was having a nightmare, told her to go back to bed. Next morning we found a ladder up against our house by her window. edit: haha, I see people are freaked it was the second floor. It was normal house, I dont know if that helps or hurts, but the top of the ladder reached it. also it happened in 1987, so you can relax a little.
In Poland we answer "no thanks" when someone wishes us "good luck" because thanking is supposed to give you bad luck instead. What are some popular superstitions in your country/area?	In England we have quite a few. It is bad luck to walk under a scaffolding It is bad luck to walk over the 3 drains in a row. It is bad luck to open an umbrella indoors. There are thousands more i cant think of right now.	Germany: if you have a drink with friends and you clink your glasses you have to do it individually with each person and look into their eyes. Otherwise it's 7 years of bad sex.
What is something worth $100 or less that everyone should own?	A record player. You never know when you might come across a really old peice of music or price of lost history on a vinal. It allows you to enjoy things that your parents or grandparents used to enjoy and you can even get vinyls from modern bands. You can get a really nice on for about $60	If you live somewhere that gets cold, thermals (long Johns or at least the part for your legs). It makes a big difference.
[Serious] Why did you fall out with your ex-best friend?	My whole goal in life from high school to the end of college was to make sure my name ended up in the history books as one of the great people of society. In high school I wanted to have my name next to people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, in college, I wanted to have my name next to guys like Alan Turing. So when my best friend in high school told me that I was never going to amount to anything because I was boring, that struck a nerve. On the bright side, I looked him up on facebook a year ago. I work at Google, he works at Subway. Revenge is sweet.	I had a best friend for 45 years. We almost grew up together, almost like brothers. He got married and had two boys. They were like family to me. Then, after his increasingly obnoxious pestering about me getting married, I finally broke the news to him that I'm gay. He was my best friend; I should count on him, right? No! He grabbed my throat, slammed me against a wall, and growled, "Don't you ever come near my boys!" I haven't spoken to him since, and I never will.
What is the most ridiculous thing you have ever seen a tourist get upset over?	I can't speak for other tourists, but I'm super enraged by places where you have to pay for bottled water because there are no public water fountains, and where you have to pay to use the bathroom. In Italy, where I was a paying customer at numerous restaurants and repeatedly asked for tap water to go with my meal, almost all the servers everywhere said "you have to buy bottled water, we don't serve tap". What the fuck do you dipshits drink and cook with? Plus maybe I don't like the idea of adding to the Pacific or Atlantic trash gyres when I don't have to. Having to pay to go to the bathroom makes me want to fling piss and shit **everywhere**. Hope your Euro was worth it, fuckers. Say whatever you want about the US; here we drink, piss, and shit for free.	Here in California, we hear stupid shit all the time. My favorite is when during the summer, people go to San Francisco in shorts and then bitch about how cold it is. Do some research people!
Redditors over 30 or so: In what ways has the world changed in your lifetime that we youngsters wouldn't even think of?	wristwatches, if you had one it was a sign you were grown up and could keep time. if it was digital you were luke skywalker sci-fi cool, if it was analog you were super smart enough to read it. nowadays a wristwatch is like non prescription eye glasses, just for show and you look like a poser.	When you were going to meet someone, you used to have to make firm plans and then stick to them because you were incommunicado when you were away from home.
What’s a thing you do that you know annoys other people?	I'm a gum snapper like my father before me. I don't care who it bothers. It's loud as all hell and makes me feel like a big man.	I constantly leave the kitchen cabinets open. It’s not intentional, I just forget to close them. My mom calls it poltergeisting.
What very minor confession would you like to make?	I think FPSs without a mouse and keyboard are a quaint gimmick sub-genre. I consider them to be First Person Shooter Simulators.	As a kid, I once turned off the lights in a TGIFridays bathroom on the way out because of habit. There were still people in there. I was too embarrassed to turn them back on so I ran.
Reddit, what are some college majors that should definitely be avoided?	Unless you are one of the idle rich who is inheriting enough money to last you more than a life time, avoid all the humanities. Those majors were specifically created in a vain attempt to try to make idle rich (nobility) better people. Sometimes it works. If you are idle rich, I would definitely encourage a degree in the humanities.	If you're a journalism major, getting involved in student publications/media is way more important than classes. Journalists aren't hired based off of their degree, but how well acclimated they are to newsrooms, deadlines, etc. You can't learn the trade in the classroom, only in the field. Classes are to just help you refine your skills and the little things EDIT: I didn't mean to imply that classes are useless. The degree itself pretty much is, but most of my professors are accomplished/active journalists so they have so much to teach students that really is invaluable. The classes do matter to help you in the field.
What is the biggest waste of money that people regularly buy?	What people buy with their money is their own business. (Most people) worked hard for it so they can buy whatever they want	Those damn cleansers for your body that remove "toxins" You have one already. It's called your liver and kidneys. If you want to stop feeling like shit, eat better and exercise.
What makes you feel better when you're down?	Complete domination of another human being. Whether in a video game, board game, or "accidentally" hip checking a 6-year-old in the face after he knocked my 4-year-old down. Seriously, that fucking gremlin basically attacked my daughter inside of a moonbounce so I decided to hop in and play. "Boxing him out" for the moonbounce basketball game was so goddamn satisfying. I was in a horrible mood that day and watching that mouth-breather knock my daughter over on purpose and laugh at her was the absolute last fucking straw. I took a deep breath and did my best to make it look like an accident while trying so hard to not laugh. Took my daughter for ice cream afterwards and felt 1,000 time better.	I just do a handstand, and then I find that my frown once turned upside down actually turns into a.... No I'm playin, I drink a lot.
What sucks at first, but gets better with age?	Conservatism. All kids are liberals, all immature adults are democrats, all who experience life and the ups and downs that come with it know that conservatism is the true path.	Most jobs. Learning curve and stress are high at first, but once you get the hang of things, it's a lot better.
Cab drivers of reddit, what is the weirdest thing someone has done in your taxi?	Not a cab, but related. Local beach town has a late nite bus service that goes around to all the bars. A smokin hot milf gets on the bus packed with a bunch of dudes in the back.......and they slowly start to chant, getting louder and louder: COUUUUGAR! COUUUUUUUUUGARRRR! COUUUUUUUGGGGGAAARRRR! She was blushing so hard but you could tell it made her year. The entire bus was laughing our asses off at how funny it was.	I'll post from the customer's perspective. I rarely take cabs, but I hailed one when I was on vacation with my wife. After a minute in the cab a foul smell assaulted me and I looked over to my wife who was laughing. That bitch then proceeded to blame it on me while the cab driver smoothly rolled down his window without blaming anyone. I gave a huge tip. I was mortified by the cruelty she showed that day.
Who is either really sexy or super ugly depending on who you ask?	Maisie Williams. I feel like whoever cast her as Arya Stark assumed she was going to grow up to be much prettier than she turned out. But some people find her extremely attractive... Ah well.	I find nothing sexier than when people post a pic of the person they're talking about. Seriously I don't know who half these people are.
What’s your “I hate that I know that” fact?	That no matter how hardworking or diligent I am at my job, i still have to work twice as hard as a man to be recognised or acknowledged. Source : am female in I.T	The majority of “Code Blue” patients in the hospital die. We can bring them most of them back for a little while, but only 10-20 percent make it out of the hospital. If they do make it, they likely have severe deficits and poor quality of life. I don’t know offhand how many survivors die within a year of discharge but I probably don’t want to know that either. Many times it’s a frail elderly person who wasn’t allowed a dignified death :( If your beloved 90 year old granny with dementia is in the hospital and the doctors or nurses urge you to consider putting a “Do not resuscitate” order on them, please consider it. And for the love of god, if granny has DNR wishes on HERSELF and then becomes incapacitated, please don’t revoke it.
A cop saw me stalking my cat in a very cat like fashion. When have you suddenly realized someone was watching that you didn't expect?	I was dancing like a crazy person on crack( bit I wasn't) and my neighbor noticed me and she started dancing too	I was standing on the patio having a lengthy conversation with my cat about how air conditioning works and why I can't leave the patio door open. The neighbors found this quite odd and disturbing.
What do you remember about life before the internet?	I remember being on ICQ just before the dawn of the internet. It was pretty neat to communicate with the people across the globe.	Other than going outside all the time, when we did play video games there were no walkthroughs readily available at a moments notice. You figured it out on your own by playing the board a zillion times until you beat it.
What thing WILL get you fired in one job, but WON'T in another?	Spouting ridiculous, unfounded racial slurs and sexist nonsense, as well as purveying *'alternative'* facts will get you fired in most places. ...Unless you're a Republican politician.	Accepting tips. In most non-service-sector jobs this is a huge no-no. I work a retail job where I was actually told as part of my orientation that accepting tips from customers or vendors is grounds for immediate firing.
Without naming your favorite movie, what is your favorite movie?	The original trilogy (not the three prequels) in which people with laser swords who can move stuff with their minds battle it out in an epic battle of good vs. evil filled with spaceships and laser guns and such	Guy gets stuck on Mars and listens to the worst disco songs he has ever heard. Edit: Forgot to mention that he also eats potatoes farmed in his own shit. So uncivilised.
What products look like a gimmick, but actually work really well?	The Apple AirPods. All jokes withstanding, almost everyone who's tried it agrees that it truly is amazing how it works. I'm pretty sure if the price was lower many more people would actually be buying it instead of joking about it.	A bread machine. Dump in $.50 worth of stuff, come back in 4 hours to freshly baked bread. Magic. Edit: YOW! this took off. I have an Oster 4811. I've had it forever, 15 years probably. There's some on eBay for $40-ish.
What was the stupidest way you saw someone try to get high?	Smoke lucky charms. His roommate was berating him the whole time as well. They're both disabled as well so they speak in these Stephen hawking like voices. Their other roommate Greg recorded it all. It was fucking hilarious.	Was smoking some bud with some friends while playing some games. As we were passing the typical weed pipe, the newest addition to our group claimed he was having difficulty getting a good rip while intermittently saying ow. Turns out he was trying to light the bowl from the bottom of the pipe, and the flames were crawling up the sides burning him. Either he was newer to smoking than he claimed, was already incredibly stoned, or used to smoking meth.
One of the first girls I ever had sex with turned out to be the kinkiest and due to her, a neighbor called the police. What other awkward sexual experiences have you had?	Was getting neck from this shordy, back of her neighbor house or whateva, she get to working my jiffy then her sister pull up and shit, I get to runnin and get a text from shorty talkin bout her sister bouta make her get on child support	I was at my friends house for a party and I was getting a BJ on his parents bed from my girlfriend (edit). They weren't suppose to come home but since everyone knows the subject of this reddit, they did. Everyone was in the basement so I guess his parents didn't know anything was up. They walked in on me mid-BJ on their bed. To make matters worse they know me very well and called me out into the hall to have a talk about what just happened. However I was mid-BJ so for the first few moments of this conversation I had a erection, making my embarrassing moment even worse.
[serious] What's the most fucked up thing someone you know has done?	I know a kid who pissed off another kid. So the other kid was at a party with the 1st kid and his girlfriend and gave the kids girlfriend a bunch of Molly. He then fucked her in the driveway on her hands and knees but before doing so texted his friends to pick a fight with the 1st kid. So as the kids getting his ass kicked in the back yard his girls getting fucked doggy style on the pavement. That's some medieval scheming in my opinion. Funny thing is the kid and his girlfriend are still together; fucking dummies.	A former co-worker shot to death his toddler daughter then himself. Apparently, he was distraught over a custody battle with his ex-wife. My friends and I from that job were pretty shaken up by that. The guy always seemed a bit on edge, but never seemed violent or mentally disturbed like that.
Children of teen parents, what was your life like growing up? How is your relationship with your parents now?	A 15 year old girl I know recently had a baby. She apparently tried to bring it in to class once and got upset and threw a fit when the teacher told her she had to take her son home. So take from that what you will	My mum and dad were 16 and 18 when I was born. My mum came from an abusive home and my dad from a happy home, however shortly before I was born lost his dad and shortly after I was born lost his mum. We had no money, no holidays and struggled to make it through every month but I can say hand on heart that I was loved with everything they had to give, and that meant I had an extremely happy childhood and I was raised to respect people and work hard. Now aged 24, we are the best of friends. I talk to both of them about everything. And finally after 28 years together, mum and dad are getting married next month!! ☺️
Retail workers of Reddit, what's the most bizarre, disturbing, or frightening thing you've seen at work?	Used to work repairing cell phones. The thing that got me the most was the amount of times I was threatened. Everything from getting me fired to killing me. I was told on average every couple of weeks that the person would be waiting for me when I left. I was threatened several times with, "I'm gonna come back up here, and shoot up all ya'll mufuckas" It's a cell phone people. For the record the store was near a pretty rough area. I always at least tried to help the person within the company policies. But I'm sorry, sometimes I just can't help. Like when you run over your phone and come in the store and demand I give you a brand new one off the shelf for free.	Used to work in a shoe store. When people would try on shoes, we'd have a box of little disposable stockings sitting by the lounge area so that customers didn't have to put their bare feet in the shoes. One time a young teenage girl was trying on a pair of heels for her prom and when she was done she left the stockings on the chair. When he thought nobody was looking, I saw this older gentleman who was waiting for his wife nearby pick up the stockings, smell them, and put them in his pocket. *shudder*
Teachers or professors of Reddit, what is the most elaborate cheating scheme you've stumbled upon?	Wtf to all you idiots explaining how you cheated. YOU pay good money to go to school and LEARN. If you can't learn, just drop out, because you're ripping yourself off. I went to school with tons of cheaters. I studied and graduated at the top of my class. The whole time I would get nagged by idiots for copies of my homework etc.	University of Florida circa 1985. Once a final began the answers were posted across campus so you could grade your final and figure your grade. One fraternity had their pledges get the answers. They then used a Mr. Microphone to broadcast them to brothers via FM Walkmans.
NSFW, Gone Wild posters who show their face, what do you do for a living? Has it ever been a problem at work?	I had a manager at work that had face pics of her sucking and fucking multiple dicks on fetlife. She was always kind of a cunt to me. One day when she was yelling at me, I showed her said pics on my phone, and she looked mortified. I told her to leave me alone and I'd leave her alone. She quit the next day.	I'm a marketing manager for a company I've been with for almost 8 years. I've posted a good 15 face photos over the years, alongside a ton of body-only posts. I'm on my third username, but - about 4 years ago one of my coworkers found me on reddit. Everyone else in the company got a look, including the owner. Alas, I'm still here, hah. I'm managing the fuck out of some marketing.
Do you think the next generation will have more 70's style parenting?	God willing the kids that were raised with spankings as opposed to 'time outs' will start giving their kids a sore ass when they need it. The snowflake generation needs to go away.	I think another thing which stemmed from the 90's, would be "helecopter parents''. It also appears that this is one trend that is not going away, as parents appear to be as overprotective than ever.
Hiring managers of Reddit - what is the most genious answer you got on a job interview?	interviewed at sallie mae and they started off with that why do you want to work here question. i answered, "well i always wanted to get into loan- sharking and this seems like a good way to test entry to the field."	Why do you want to work here? "I want to make a certain amount of money, and this company seems like the most interesting and enjoyable place where I can make that money"
What's a film that is hated by critics that you absolutely love?	Star Wars. The original, the one with Luke and Obi-Wan? Yeah, when it came out it was pretty much universally panned by the critics for being uninspired rehashing.	When I was growing up I just assumed that everyone regarded the 1988 Ron Howard/Lucasfilm fantasy film Willow to be this classic of adventure cinema in the same iconic category as the likes of Back to the Future, The Princess Bride, Jurassic Park and the Star Wars and Indiana Jones trilogies. It sure was to me; watched it a hundred times, loved it loved it loved it. It wasn't until wayyy later - like, until I read the film's Wikipedia entry in like college or something - that I was utterly gobsmacked to learn that it was generally a poorly regarded film that got bad reviews in its day. I couldn't believe it. This shit was the Citizen Kane of fantasy movies to me.
Hell is now personalized to torture specifically you. What's in your hell that makes it unbearable?	Walking on a side walk with a line of people infront of you walking much slower and taking up the entirety of the side walk. I'm also using a cell phone that keeps freezing and is on an edge network	I'm given a task to do at a desk on a windows 95 computer that crashes every hour and sometimes fails to save my work. It doesn't matter, though because every time I start to work someone comes up to talk to me about something.
Guys that stuck their dick in crazy regardless of warnings, what happened next?	I has to spend 2 weeks away with work in a hotel. My now ex had her implant taken out and didnt tell me. She told me when she thought she was pregnant. To make things worse she was gluten intolerant which she didnt obide to so always looked 6 months pregnant. If Dani ever reads this. Fuck off! Lol	She tried to kill me with her car by ramming me (i was in my car) and then chasing me around a parking lot in her vehicle until she lost control and wrecked into a few others.
What about this sub do you hate the most?	People complaining about reposted questions. Shut up. Most of the time you'll get people who weren't around the last time the question was posted, or got there too late, who will post new stories and stuff in the comments	Not hate but I find it strange that the same question gets asked over and over again. Sometimes it gets the the front page and sometimes it doesn't, I feel it's the answers that get the post to the front page.
I have no problem eating alone in a restaurant, and I love going to movies by myself. Is this normal, or weird/sad?	I wake up super early (much, much earlier than my friends) and will often go to breakfast by myself. I like sitting at the counter of some greasy spoon and yakkin' at the cooks or whatever. Eating alone at a restaurant at dinnertime, though, it's creepytown USA. It's all about context.	I'm about the same way. I've never been to a movie by myself, but I do eat by myself. People at my college are utterly afraid of doing anything by themselves. Take my roommate: if he can't find someone to go eat dinner with him he stays in our room eating pretzels and watching Hulu.
Doctors of reddit, what was a symptom a patient didn’t mention that was really important?	This is 100% why someone else needs to review the reports. I had a transvaginal ultrasound (basically a ultrasound wand shoved up inside) looking at a mass on my ovary. Ultrasound tech had done my last few tests to see if it was growing and commented that my uterus was tilted. Well, a few months later I had a CATscan that revealed it wasnt tilted I have a septate uterus. So basically instead of joining into one big uterus there is a small septum (kind of like what separates your nostrils) at the top of my uterus. Now I'm not petty enough to sue, but all I could think was that the tech gave me wrong information.	16 /o. came in with blood pressure of 60/30. Pale as a ghost. Tons of free fluid in his abdomen on ultrasound. Turned out he had metastatic testicular cancer that had eroded into his aorta and was bleeding into his belly. Come to find out later he had testicle lumps and was too scared to tell anyone. &#x200B; Edit: for those asking, we resuscitated him with blood and fluids and transferred him to the nearest Peds ICU. He was treated, lived a few months and passed, away. It was incredibly sad. I think of him often.
In your opinion what is the greatest plot twist in any book, film or video game?	Joker dying in Arkham City I never thought Batman's arch-nemesis would die. He always seems to escape or be saved(usually by Batman).	**SPOILERS** In the **book** "I Am Legend", the main character uses his days to kill these vampire-like zombies while they sleep, then goes back home at night to stay safe in his home-fortress. Eventually they break in and capture him and jail him. Well, He's seen these vampire-zombies as monsters for years, and he's been told he will be executed. When they bring him out for his execution, the crowd is truly terrified of him. They see him as the monster. This guy who's been killing their people when they sleep. He was the awful monster. He was the legend.
Redditors who spend a lot of time in seclusion (at sea, in the air, or out in the wilderness) what's the creepiest or most mysterious thing you've seen, found or experienced?	I spend a lot of time in seclusion at my home in front of my computer. One day I opened my front door to receive an online order from FedEx. My eyes were blinded by this thing called sunlight that outside people talk about. Most mysterious thing I've ever seen.	My dad claims he felt a nuclear submarine go under him while windsurfing off of Hawaii. Apparently, it sounded like someone held down a bass pedal to an organ for about 30 seconds.
Women of Reddit! What was your most awkward moment involving the Penis??	Well they're pretty funny looking so every time I see one, I giggle uncontrollably. I've offended some men this way and I feel bad about it, but I honestly can't help it.	I'm a dude but I had a chick in high school (way back) ask me if men's dicks were prehensile. The way she asked it, though, was with an example question, "So, like, can you use it to turn the pages while reading the newspaper?"
Professionals in any field of work, what is the most ridiculous thing that anyone outside of your profession has claimed to know more about than you?	I'm an economist. I get extremely frustrated when non-economists try to explain to me that socialism and/or communism are sustainable in anything other than the short run.	Got in an argument with a woman at Whole Foods, she wanted to buy grass fed pork. There is no such thing, grass cannot support a pig they have to eat a heavy grain filled diet. Woman did not believe me or my 10 years of farm and meat selling experience. Got to the point I told the woman I would ship her a piglet so she could raise it completely on grass and watch it die from starvation. I don't do demos at Whole Foods anymore.
What is the most unfair thing in life?	If a man shits on a table it's disgusting but if a woman does it it's hot! It's all feminisms fault!	Sometimes a person gets born into a family that’s awful: abuse, neglect, etc. They’re fucked just because they got born into the wrong family.
What is your College or Uni famous, or infamous, for?	The Ohio State University. Generally famous for being amazing at football while having a generally obnoxious fan base. Our beaucracy is massive, we promote sustainable energy while making questionable investments, a massive medical campus, and always having construction on campus at all times. But Let's Go Bucks! OH!	Northern Arizona University is the only school to be surrounded on 3 sides by cemeteries. We even made it on to a Trivial Pursuit card for it. Halloween was awesome at that school.
What's the best "You can't get pregnant if..." myth you've ever heard?	Please help me break this 5 way tie: 1) if you're really a virgin 2) if you don't have an orgasm 3) you do it standing up 4) you do it in/under water 5) if the boy is bi	A guy in my junior year sex ed class argued with our teacher that a girl can't get pregnant if she's already had kids.
You are teleported back to the same spot as now, but in the early 1800. You keep all stuff on you, all your knowledge and a phone with modern internet access and unlimited battery. How do you proceed?	I would track down the superiors of the various British colonies across the country and, with evidence on my phone, discuss the importance of the power they hold in the next two centuries over their current "captives" and the life changing events they could alter. These "captives" would later become one of the most repressed and culture stripped people in the world, the Indigenous Australians. Thinking logically however, I don't believe anyone would listen to a teenage girl with an unfamiliar accent and a "magic interactive box" back then, so this is very far fetched.	Well, I'm in Japan right now so I will most likely be arrested and executed by the shogunate for being a foreigner, because, you know, sakoku policy and all. Unless.... Perry comes at the right time and tells the shogun to "open the country. stop having it be closed."
What are you doing to improve yourself?	*left the love of my life, an abuser in all the ways *quit smoking 1.5 years ago after 20 years *down from 257 lbs. to 170 lbs. with a decent amount of lean muscle coming through now *have become more physically and politically active *cut out most junk food and refined sugars, especially pop (sticking to black coffee, green tea, and lemon/lime water) *reduced tv/movie consumption and replaced with (even more) reading	3 years ago: Quit drinking 2 years ago: Quit smoking 1.5 years ago: Quit vaping 1 year ago: Improved my sleep pattern 7 months ago: Improved Diet (Down 20 pounds) 1 Month ago: Introduced mild exercise into my daily routine. ___________ I'm not even sure how I've gotten this far.
What is a minor thing that infuriates you when eating at a restaraunt?	When the restaurant is mostly empty, but the waiter/waitress tries to seat us directly next to someone. Bonus points when the people have a baby or loud kids. I immediately walk over to another table far away and say, "I think we are going to sit here" and smile.	Loud live music to the point where everyone is just yelling so the music gets louder and everyone gets louder and it just doesn't stop... help me...
I'm 24 and I just watched Finding Nemo for the first time. I'm so disappointed I've missed out on this great movie for years! Reddit, what movie do you think everyone should see atleast once?	I'm a bit surprised how many only either mention classics from 40s or films that are still running in some of the more far flung cinemas. There is a lot of good stuff in between, you know. Ctrl+F: "Secret of NIMH" Really, nobody mentioned this modern masterpiece? "American Tail" Neither this one? Oh geez.. surely.. "Office Space" ... "Groundhog Day" THIS WAS MENTIONED? My hope in reddit has been restored! "Hot Fuzz"? No? Really? "Shoot 'em Up" Well, this was amazing in really stupid way. "When Harry Met Sally" "Four Weddings and Funeral" "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain" I'm a sucker for romances, really. But nobody mentioned these either? Oh for.. Some here mentioned Pulp Fiction, Amelie, Princess Bride and Star Wars (the so-called episodes 4 - 6). These are all excellent films and you should take a look, you will not regret.	I still haven't seen Up. I know it'll blow me away when I do. I was pretty much bawling my eyes out when I finally saw Wall-E.
Where's the strangest/weirdest place that you've decided to masturbate?	My ex-girlfriend's funeral. You could see her nipples through her burial dress. Also, on the roof of a Federal Building right above an FBI Field Office. I left plenty of physical evidence behind in case they ever want to bust me for it. I'm talkin' bout my semen, son.	On the peak of a tall mountain while hiking. It was so beautiful and no one was around and that peak was the only place I got cell service.
My fathered was murdered when I was 10. The case remains unsolved. What burden are you carrying, dear Redditors?	You have the perfect situation to be a superhero. Dad killed while he was a cop, you can avenge him by fighting crime. It's perfect!	My dad died of a heart attack about two weeks before my 9th birthday - I was alone with him in the apartment, panicked, ran around the apartment building knocking on neighbours' doors for help but didn't think of calling 911. My mum found him about 5 minutes later, with me hiding behind a chair.
If you were trapped in a Ground Hog Day type loop what are the darkest things you would do, knowing that there would be no long term consequences?	Steal a big truck. Drive that sucker right through the groundhog ceremony. And probably a lot of rape. Different days obviously. Why Phil never raped Rita, I'll never understand.	I think you would end up doing all the stuff you do in Grand Theft Auto when you've completed the missions...
What secret did your family keep from you until you were an adult?	When I reached 16, my parents called me to the den, and sat me down, dour looks on their faces. "Son, they said, we've been hiding this secret from you for too many years, and figured we better tell you now so you aren't surprised later' I swallowed hard, not knowing what the heck they were on about. "Our family were slave owners" I wasn't surprised, really, my family had been in the states for generations, and we were from the South originally. I told them as much. "That's good son, we are glad you are so understanding. Now go put on a suit, we have to attend a funeral." 'For who?' "Jebediah, our slave, he died last night.. haven't you noticed the banging noises from the basement have stopped?? I did in fact, i just thought they got the damn furnace fixed finally... my parents were notoriously cheap bastards.	When my grandpa was 6 years old, his family tied a rope around his ankle and sent him head-first down a well so that he could drag up the body of his aunt, who had killed herself. He was the only one that could fit in the well. Grandpa was a hard-livin' son of a bitch. Brought up hard, rode hard, died hard. I never had the least amount of sympathy for him, until he told me that. This was about a year before he died. I asked mom about it and she said that HIS mom and dad were vile, abusive people. She had never mentioned anything about it. I understand now a lot more of what made him the man he became.
What exclusive/premium is worth paying for?	Flying first class. It's just that the cost is too damn high! But it's definitely worth it, believe me. I once got upgraded. Those were good times.	Fast Passes on a park. We didn't pay for one and could only get on three rides despite getting there at the morning. Waiting 1-2hs in line to get in a 45sec ride sucks :(
Housekeepers working for motels/hotels/resorts/Cruise ships, what is the most WTF, weird, awkward situation scene that you have stumbled upon in work?	A bunch of assorted dildos under the bed. So I decided to take them out and arrange them on the nightstand.	My mom was a hotel general manager and I basically grew up in hotels. The worst was a man who hung himself in the hotel room. On Christmas Eve. He'd driven through the night to see his kids for Christmas, and his ex wouldn't let him see them. So he went back to his hotel room and hung himself. My mom is still traumatized over finding his body. After that, she organized a party in the hotel lobby for every Christmas eve and always invited all the guests, to try to get people out of their rooms and lift their spirits if they were spending Christmas in the hotel.
What will you always judge people for doing?	Being picky eaters. Can't stand it. There's no reason a functional adult should say shit like "don't make anything with broccoli or mushrooms". No, how about you grow the fuck up?	Idiots who don't let the people getting OFF public transportation (buses, subway, etc) first. Chill out, the door will be open long enough to let you get in afterwards.
What is your NSFW fun fact about yourself?	I met a girl on OK Cupid who was interested in NSA because she wanted to have a child. She was getting to an older age and wasn’t serious with anyone. Was smoking hot so I applied. I had a vasectomy for about 5 years at this point and I ‘tried’ to knock this chick up for about 2 months. Like 5 times a week. Felt kinda bad for misleading her but she was like an 8.5.	Thanks to an autoimmune disease, my dick is a couple of different colors. No other part of my body has been affected, just my dick.
What do you consider to be the worst movie you have ever watched?	**Men Who Stare At Goats** Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but still a relevant disappointment. With all that star power, I was expecting a better, more sensical plot line. Besides that I was bored out of my mind, which should never happen while watching a film.	Epic Movie. I waste a lot of time but after that I actually felt angry about the hour I'd just lost.
Reddit, if you won free food and drinks for a lifetime to a restaurant of your choosing, what restaurant would you pick?	1.Find the world's most expensive restaurant. 2.Move near the location of this place. 3.Take the expensive bottles of wine and sell them. 4.Profit?	a chinese buffet here in canada called Mandarin, it has a large variety of options so i'd never have to pay for a meal ever again, and wouldn't be surviving off of strictly junk food for the rest of my life.
I want my cremated ashes poured into melted iron and from that iron create a heirloom,a broadsword. What do you want done with your remains?	I have wanted the same thing done to my remains. The only difference is that I want the blade inscribed with, "In life I was a poet, now I sing songs of Death."	In the 70's I worked in a steel foundry where large 10,000lb ladles were filled with steel from the furnace I operated. One night a guy jumped over the safety rail into a freshly filled ladle. That steel was poured at 3600 degrees so it's likely he vaporized before penetrating more than a few inches into the liquid metal. The ladle was set aside and the cops called but there wasn't much to see. Later they reheated the ladle and went ahead with the pour. Not really related but your post made me think of it.
[Serious]That divorce thread depressed me. Do any redditors who have been happily married for 10+ years wanna share any stories or tips?	I told my wife straight up when we started dating: Yes mean YES, No means NO. No games. If you say no Christmas gifts - guess what?! NO GIFTS. I also told her I'm not afraid to walk away from anyone or anything. We are together because we want to be - if and or when we decide we want to be with someone else - be straight up and get gone.	We just celebrated our 20th anniversary a couple of weeks ago. The biggest thing is remembering that just because you're married doesn't mean you get to be rude. If you are nicer to waiters than you are to your spouse, you're pretty much fucked. Our ground rules have always been no name calling - ever, not even "jokingly" - and no threats to leave or divorce or anything else like that. We are committed to each other and to our kids so whatever is the disagreement, there is always a way to compromise. But mostly the secret is don't marry an asshole. If a person says rude and mean things to you or to their parents or to waitstaff then the person isn't relationship material. Hold out for someone who is a decent human being and you can't go wrong.
What is the most ridiculous thing you have heard a teacher say?	If I bowed my head and closed my eyes I could telepathically communicate with a 2000 year old Jewish zombie.	Once, my teacher insisted that I was mispronouncing my name, and threatened to send me to the principal's office when I argued with her. It wasn't a fun year.
HELP! I was in a car accident with a cop during the snowy weekend. It was 100% his fault and now they're flipping it on me. What the fuck do I do?	IF you win, move... The cop and his 'brothers' will make it hell for you. Tickets for the littlest things e.g. driving 2 miles over the speed limit. You know when you signal for a left turn and before you finish the turn your signal cuts off, ticket. Park too close to another car/curb, Ticket. Forget to signal when pulling off the curb, ticket. If you lose, they may 'watch' you for a bit, but at least the 'hassle' will go away when they 'find someone else'	I am an auto accident liability adjuster and I can tell you right now, based on the facts of the accident you posted, you would be considered to be majority at fault. With some comparative or contributory negligence on the police officer for unsafe speed for conditions. But failure to yield is correct. This is how any insurance company will see it.
Reddit, how does someone let go of hate?	"For if you forgive people of their wrongdoing, your heavenly Father will forgive you as well. But if you don't forgive people, your Father will not forgive your wrongdoings." Matthew 6:14-15	For me, it goes like this: I've learned and understood that I can't change anything I've done in the past - I can only learn from them and act so I can have a better future. I've also learned to accept limitations, which are things you can't change. Things you can change are called problems, and by definition you can solve any problem. About the future, it can be anything, but you shouldn't plan much. Achievable goals and some effort (really not much) should get you progressively forward. Learn to appreciate any improvement. Meditation and relaxation techniques help. Talking about your problems (therapist or friends), or at least writing about them (even on reddit), helps a lot. Just putting your thoughts into sentences forces your brain to create patterns, organizes them and makes it easier to find the obvious solutions.
Spouses/partners of actors/actresses, how does it make you feel seeing them kiss/have sex on screen? Do you even watch it?	"Honey, I made out with another guy tonight " WHAT?? How could you??" "No it's totally cool. It was my co-worker. It's part of our job. We're actors " Oh in that case no problem babe. Hey do you want Chinese food tonight? " ...fuck outta here	My ex actually left me for the actor that she co-starred in a movie with (he was an 80s teen heart throb 15 years past his prime but apparently she had his poster on her wall when she was a kid).
Ok guys, break out the throwaways. What do you do for a living and how much do you make?	We do a phenomenal job raising puggles and boxers, around $100K give or take per year. My little wedding DJ biz makes around $50K. ** Go ahead and downvote because I'm a dog breeder. . . just like all businesses, many do it poorly. . . we are the place you would want to buy your dog from.**	Fishmonger, 15k, but I eat like I make six figures. Oh and I never have to share a seat on the bus.
What do you hate most about Facebook?	The main reason reddit hates it is because they see other people actually going out and having lives. Then they tell themselves that those people are idiots and like dumb things as they sulk in front of their computers and whack off.	* Selects *Most Recent* * Reverts back to *Top Stories* * Selects *Most Recent* * Reverts back to *Top Stories* * Selects *Most Recent* * Reverts back to *Top Stories*
What's the most meaningful interaction you've had with someone you've only met once?	I was on Bart one day (Bay area subway). This hot Asian girl sat down next to me and kept smiling at me. She sat down right next to me, which was weird because the entire car was empty except for us. She proceeded to reach into my pants give me a handjob. I was so shocked, I just sat there as we drive through the stations. Luckily no one got on our car. It is probably the most awkward and awesome experience I have ever had.	My brother got hit by a boat while on vacation. Pandemonium insued to get him to the hospital. While random people were helping get him on shore and on a stretcher, this women walked up to me (I was six at the time) with her chocolate lab puppy. She sat me down on a log facing away from the chaos. Anytime I tried to look back she basically shoved the puppy in my face to distract me. I'm very happy she did. I can't imagine having more images from that time in my mind....so, thanks lady!
What is your favorite (most exciting/page turner) book you have ever read?	Everybook of Dan Brown is a masterpiece! You should really read those. They are super exciting and once you started you won't be thinking about anything else until you finished them. I read them when i was like 14 or 15. Mostly on vacation. I finished one book per week, even tho i usually don't read at all... In most of his books the "page" gets turned into a way you would have never thought of. Also i learned a LOT while reading them. Things that are really cool to know ;)	"The Kingkiller Chronicle" by Patrick Rothfuss. Wonderfully written in a manner that makes it hard to stop reading. Those books made me thirst literature again after a long pause.
Redditors raising teenagers, what's something your teenager has lost their shit about that was utterly hilarious/pointless?	ITT: Parents that severely fucked up in parenting blaming the child that they created You can excuse a small child for being irrational from time to time, but there's always a deep rooted reason that a teenager is completely bat shit crazy like in any of these stories. Sorry, but you fucked up somewhere.	My dad has another family and with that came new kids, I let his teenage (14-15 at the time) son stay with me while the mother, father, and other daughter were away visiting colleges. I was only 24 at the time (26 now) so he and I got along pretty well. He was a little pretentious, but was OK in general. He missed the bus and I drove him to school. He asked if we could stop at a Dunkin Donuts. I told him no because I had to get to work. Oh my god. This kid starts screaming and yelling that I'm abusing him, he tries to open the door and jump out when we were stopped at a light.
Users of Reddit who survived the 90's, what are some "90's" things you miss/don't miss?	I miss Crystal Pepsi, the X-Files, real music as opposed to the garbage and rap bullshit that's on all the time now, seeing music videos on MTV instead of slutty 16-year-old pregnant whores, and Michael Jordan playing basketball instead of this low-rent fuck named LeBitch James. Don't miss: high school, Yo MTV Raps, Monica Lewinsky's ex-boyfriend as "president", and Hypercolor t-shirts.	I vaguely remember people would just drop by the house for conversations with my parents. There was a lot more face-to-face conversations. Now if you hear your doorbell ring it's like "Who the fuck is that!? It better be the UPS guy."
What is something you will never care about no matter how hard someone tries to make you care?	Feminism. Sorry, but as a man who's seen how biased courts are in favour of women, watching my newly elected prime minister make half his cabinet women "because it's 2016" and watching the world cater to every issue women have no matter how big or small while at the same time completely ignoring all efforts for men to get on an equal playing field (yes, it's gotten to the point where men are at a disadvantage) or listening to anything any man has to say because "UMMMMM CHECK UR PRIVILEGE!!!!", I refuse to believe women are oppressed. Also, feminists do some really terrible shit and are all around very angry, shitty people. I'm in favour of equal rights for all, not superiority for any group.	Other peoples children who aren't related to me. So many times I've sat through co-workers showing me pictures of their kids. *I so don't care that they have a new swing set*
Stepped outside at 1:37 am and thinking I was safe, let one rip. To my horror I look up to see my neighbor staring at me. He then lets out the loudest fart I've ever heard, shrugged and went back inside. Reddit, what has someone done to save you some serious embarrassment?	I went on a field trip and peed my pants, my friend threw water on his pants and said "Peeing your pants is cool!"	I was walking down a street in the city centre when "Straight Outta Compton" came on my iPod. After a minute or so, I realised I had inadvertantly been mouthing along with the words as well as doing Ice Cube style angry rapper facial expressions. I'm white and this was in a city in Northern England so I would have looked a right twat. Then I noticed, walking towards me, this big rocker doing a subtle air guitar with his eyes half shut in metal fan guitar solo extacy. Made me feel totally normal.
What's something that looks easy to do, but is actually difficult?	Getting a gold on reddit. you see people with random comments getting them, but its hard when you try for a gold yourself.	Being flexible. You see a dancer moving their legs and back around and think "T I could do that!" next thing you know you're on the floor writhing in pain with a dislocated hip and a bruised ego.
Finally got a job. Background check came back with false information. Took over a month to dispute it. Finally cleared. No longer have the job offer. -- What are my (legal) options?	Legal options ? Job ? LOL you have none other then civil court and sueing ? When will people learn that in the world of capitalism i.e. a job, most rights do not apply. The work force is the most fascist part of America. Under private employment the Constitution is almost completely null and void, to the employee. Same goes for consumers as well, when you walk into k/wall mart you might as well be in a foreign country.	I had similar problems with LexisNexis. I was denied housing at an apartment complex and lost out on several jobs because they released the wrong records repeatedly. I wrote to them several times saying they had the wrong person or something and still lost another job. I ended up being part of a class action lawsuit against them, won, received compensation, and never had a problem from them again.
I am a social outcast and I don't want to be. I want to have something to look forward to in the day. How do I make and keep friends?	best thing to do is get off reddit and social media these are SAP generators and the worst thing for you	I went a year where I had to survive by making friends quickly in new situations and then move and keep the old friends. Here's a good failsafe, "listen a lot, don't say much, and be the person who never worries, never causes problems, and likes to clean dishes." Everyone needs someone like that, a calming, clean influence that does the dishes.
[Serious] Psychiatrists/Psychologists of Reddit, what is the most profound or insightful thing you have ever heard from a patient with a mental illness?	I know after 11 hours this most likely will not be seen. But so many of you psychologists/psychiatrists/MFT/LCSW/etc need to work on your phrasing. Stop referring to a patient by their disorder. It not only stigmatizes them but you are telling them that they are their disorder. You wouldn't tell someone with cancer that they are cancer would you? No, you wouldn't, because that's fucking terrible and they have 0 control over it. So why would you call someone who suffers from bi-polar, schizophrenia, etc (something they have no neurological control over) by their disorder. Phrasing people.	I'm a recovery specialist, and one time my client said.. " I guess I missed the transition from when the ground was lava and imaginary friends became schizophrenia" That broke my heart.
What little thing do people do that takes your anger from 0 to 100 instantly?	Being cut up on the road. People that merge into by braking zone. When people praise Coldplay for their "talent". Dog owners. Vape culture.	They say "Sorry" in an angry 'fuck you' type of way when they are apologizing for something THEY did wrong.
People who are related to Porn stars, how has this affected your life?	I'm not related to any porn stars, or even cam girls, but I *did* see a deer outside my school today.	Not anymore but my mom used to be a porn star. I always knew she had a rough up bringing but when I was just "comming of age" I stumbled upon one of those retro porn image boards. Needless to say it was a long time before I looked at porn again.
40+ year old redditors, what advice do you wish you knew in your 20's?	Be necessary. Be polite. Be on time. Work harder not smarter. Time and truth are far more valuable than you think. Expectations lead to resentments. Learn to enjoy spending time alone. Find a job you can do until you die. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. You won't remember what you said but the person you said it to may remember it forever. Do some kind of service work. If you have to steal or commit fraud to get rich then you are a fucking asshole and your death will be lonely, slow and painful. (I'm 41)	You know way less than you think you do. Read more, take in as much information as you can & question it internally.
[Serious] What are 3rd World's day to day problems that people in Developed Countries have no idea about?	"Hmm should I drink water from this puddle?" "I haven't eaten in 3 days,guess today isn't any different" "Damn,I have to take a shit but it's 1am and outside are malaria carrying mosquitoes,venomous spiders/snakes and if I get bit its game over" "Why are people with ak-47 coming towards the village?"	Lebanon: 1. There are mountains of garbage in the streets because our government was stupid enough not to find a new garbage dump for the ENTIRE country when the contract for the old one ended. So ofcourse now with the fall-winter rains, the water is mixing in with the garbage and poisoning our wells. 2. We have no president because, again, our country's ministers are SO stupid they won't stop bickering for 5 seconds to elect a new one that isn't "pre-approved" by other Middle Eastern countries. 3. We have regular power cuts every 4 hours each day. 4. The slightest rains caused all our streets to be flooded (mix that in with the garbage floating around) so we are facing regular floods daily. Oh the list goes and on and on.
Redditors of Florida, how has your employer handled the impending wrath of Hurricane Irma regarding your personal preparations and evacuation?	i'm an employer. And in our industry we have a huge deadline next week. we are located in central florida where we won't see a ton of damage. we are asking essential employees to work tomorrow, and we'll probably leave it up to them whether to come in monday. if power is down we are down and can't work.	South Florida resident here. My employer has handled it very well. I have been off since yesterday and since I'm salaried, I still get paid. Almost like a vacation, except with a potential for death.
What new rule was created because of what you did?	I was the cause of a worldwide gaming controversy, and tools were created to detect cheaters like myself. And, I was caught.	They made a "No Front Ponytail" rule because I got a bunch of girls to believe if you wore your ponytail in the front of your head, you'd attract unicorns and get a wish.
If you got an offer of receiving 1 million dollars per year but but in exchange never to masturbate or watch porn again, would you take the offer? Why or why not?	depends what would happen if i did, would all the money disappear? if so then id try and spend it as quick as possible, my willpower isnt that strong :P	Hookers exist, money buys hookers, lots of money buys hookers that will do the weird shit you see in porn. Hypothetical dead
Teachers, when did karmic justice FINALLY come to that one troublesome student?	One time a couple of students poured a bucket of pig's blood on the Prom Queen as a prank. Fortunately, they got their just desserts when she telekenetically flipped their car and then blew it up.	Had a kid that threw a lock at my head not get expelled because "it just slipped out of her hand". She got expelled a few months later for bringing a weapon to school.
People who have walked out during a job interview, what happened?	I thought I had won a free tour of a chocolate factory, but in reality it was a job interview filled with deadly perils designed to pick a successor for the founder. Well, I took the first opportunity I could and tried to swim to safety in this river filled with chocolate.	When I realized it was door to door sales even though the job ad and the person I spoke to on the phone made it sound like a completely different job. If you have to trick people into interviewing with your company, something is wrong.
My GF hits me whenever I upset her, how can I get her to seriously think I'm not OK with this?	As a couple's therapist, I have some advice. Secretly tape it happening, save this in case things get out of control. If/when you want it to change, call the police immediately and give them your evidence. This is domestic abuse and it's not your fault. You deserve better and she deserves to go to jail just as a man would in this situation.	>I've told her I take that very seriously and tell her it's abusive, she says it's because I'm emotionally abusive. I don't know how to handle it. It's sounds like you have tried everything. I would leave her.
If all the breakfast cereal mascots were to fight to the death, who would win?	It's been decided the last 20 times this question was asked that Cap'n Crunch wins, since he's got military experience and a weapon.	Tony the Tiger would probably have the upper hand since he appears to be bigger than all of them, and he's a tiger. But Count Chocula might be a contender too if the fight is at night. The bee from honey nut cheerios may pack a potent sting, but he is small in stature.
What’s the coolest thing you’ve done by accident?	I roasted my school bully and became the most popular kid for like 2 hours In year 6... Then the next day, he stopped me in the hallway and told me to meet him afterschool and I responded " sorry I'm straight" just without thinking, and there were like 200+ peeps there so everyone laughed including some teachers who didn't like him. He ended up moving schools and I also told a girl who nobody liked who had a crush on me "if I dated you, I'd turn gay in a hour" also without thinking, so I was known as "the smoking savage" for the rest of the year. btw Idk my sexuality yet but I hope I will soon.	Did this bicycle kick in high school soccer. I was just goofing around but the Varsity coach witnessed it and gave me a position on the team. I was a terrible player, but they never knew because I was just a backup.
[Serious] People who attempted suicide but survived, what were your last thoughts?	Oddly enough, my very last thought before pulling the trigger was just wondering if there was an afterlife and what it would be like.	I have major depressive disorder and have had episodes of psychotic depression. It got so bad I became convinced I was dead, like actually dead but somehow I just kept going. I decided I would slit my wrists and if it hurt I would stop and get help and if it didn't I would keep going cause I was already dead. It took a few slices but suddenly I could feel a hint of pain so I thought I must still be alive.
Teachers, did you teach anyone that is now famous today? What were they like?	I taught Obama when he was in middle school. He came in every day smelling like old spice and marijuana. Once caught him blowing coke off a tranny's dick in the janitor's closet. Fucking Obama.	My grandma taught Axl Rose in kindergarten in Lafayette, Indiana. He was known as Bill Bailey back then. She said he was an adorable, sweet, freckle-faced redhead who loved to sit with her at the piano and sing along to the song, "Won't You Come Home, Bill Bailey?" When my brother and I showed her a picture of what he looks like now, she was shocked. Cracked us up.
Hypothetically, if I was threatened by a moderator without provocation, what should I do?	the.. police..report? Guy tells you that he thinks you're good looking and you start flipping out and call the cops. You must be a *blast* at parties.	So, I moderate /r/askscience which is one of the biggest subreddits. Here's something you should know about moderators: **they're just random people who volunteer to help run a subreddit.** They're not sworn to uphold some code of ethics, they're not the elite of a crack team of internet pirates, they're not Neo dialed into the Matrix, and they only have the power to remove threads, ban people, and add funny captions to the sidebar. If you're having an actual problem with reddit, be it the software not working or somebody harrassing or stalking you, **message the administrators**. They actually work for reddit, have actual capabilities and access to information, and are heavily invested in maintaining user experience. Mods are just goofballs who can make their names green.
I have to write a paper about and argue against gay marriage for class. Can anyone explain to me any legitimate reasons not to allow gay marriage?	Probably going to be heavily downvoted because Reddit tends to be ultra-liberal and really isn't open minded about this sort of thing, but I believe gay marriage shouldn't be allowed because by definition it's between a man and a woman. So honestly just wording. I'd vote for a legalization of gay marriage thing anyway because it's better for there to be fairness and justice, but I think by definition marriage is between a man and a woman. I want there to be a new word for gay marriages (other than just "gay marriage.") It's really not a big or notable reason, but you could mention wording for your assignment. Further, you could talk about the family unit and how that might be affected, but there's no data to conclusively state it would be much different with homosexual couples, as far as I know.	You should argue the state was always wrong, on a principled level, of any sort of social engineering. You should abolish all marriage. You can additionally argue you're trying to protect gay people from the evils of marriage because it sucks you of all ambition and hope for the future.
Your Ex is on Reddit, and you know will read this, what do you want to say to them?	I've earned $300-$400k each year for the past 7 years, still doing the business you were so critical of. Boo hoo, your dad also had a small business, he never got it off the ground and thus didn't pay child support when he was supposed to. I told you I didn't give a shit about your father, and that I didn't intend on rushing my business growth to compete with your memory of someone I never even met. How's your shit teaching job going? My wife doesn't have to work - we're just home all day in our 5-bedroom house, with our designer labradoodle and our sweet toddler.	my ex is on reddit. i know his username. i don't think he knows mine. thank you for being my best friend even for just a few short years. It was the fucking best.
What's the coolest way to waste $1000?	A copy of Paul Blart Mall Cop on Blu-ray is $6.96 on amazon, so I guess 143 copies of Paul Blart Mall Cop Edit: spellign	1000 $1 bills, y'all. I've always wanted a legitimate reason to yell "Make it Rain!" without throwing like 6 notes in the air then spending an awkward amount of time picking them up
What is the sluttiest moment of your life?	By r/twoxchromasomes standards half the people in this thread have been raped and the other half are rapists. Rape culture seems like a lot of fun.	A milf at a party told me I had a nice beard. I said if she liked it so much she could sit on it. She did.
What's the funniest/most cruel prank you've seen students play on a teacher?	Well this prank was not really on one teacher but on a couple pupils parents and most likely also a couple teachers.. There is a parents-talk-to-teachers day (or whatever it is called) twice a year in our school and they ask pupils to bring cake or cookies every time. One time me and two of my friends decided to bring something aswell so we looked for some ingrediens in my friends kitchen. We ended up bringing shortbread biscuits covered with melted chocolate in which we hid crunched cat-food and chilli. People had to pay for these.	One of my high school teachers always checked under her car for an assailant whenever she had to go somewhere, especially in the evening. One kid got it in his head to stuff a scarecrow under her car and the next day she came back with a hilarious story about how she was shouting at it to get out from under her car for like 30 mins before she realized that it wasn't a real person.
What's the weirdest compliment you've ever recieved?	"But you have such a nice name!" I'm transgender and I barely pass so people can usually tell I'm trans. A nice older couple was talking to me and asked me what my 'real name' was, they already knew my preferred name since it was on my name tag. I told them I didn't like telling people it. One of them then said that. How do you know if it's a nice name if you don't even know it??	A drunk phone call from an employee, in which he told me I was a good supervisor and immediately compared me to Kim Jung Un. Then he invited me to a football game. Good guy.
How do you answer "Tell us something interesting about yourself"?	"Fuck off, you should be hiring me on the basis of my skills not all this soft, vacuous, girly, touchy-feely shit. Good day Sir"	My brother and l are technically fraternal twins but he is 2 years older than me. We were IVF (in vitro fertilization) babies and were both from the same batch of eggs and were fertilized (ie conceived) on the same day but then l was frozen as an embryo and implanted back in my mom 1 year after he was born.
Redditors who married their SO after a short time of dating, how did you know that he/she is The One? How's everything going so far?	I knew he was the one when he moved in with me leaving his whole life behind for me yet still standing his ground and confronting me about things that matter. We got married after a year living together. Its going very well so far, we celebrated our first aniversary not too long ago and we have a baby together now	Met on a night out when she was out with a friend, I was out with my friends and we randomly got introduced to each other by a mutual friend. We instantly clicked. Ninety minutes later we had decided to get married. Saw each other almost every day after that night. Bought a flat together three months later. Got married the following year. This was back in the mid nineties. Still happily married after over twenty years together with some kids.
I just want someone to hold before falling asleep or right after waking up. What are the worst things about being single?	The same as you, I'm not single but my girlfriend and I are too young to live together, so apart from the occasional weekend night, it's sleeping alone. Once you've had someone in bed [not sex, just physically in the bed] it's difficult to go without.	Grocery shopping for one right after a breakup is a sad thing indeed. "This meat loaf recipe serves a happy couple for one dinner with leftovers to take for lunch, or one lonely man for eight consecutive meals."
What do you wish was socially acceptable?	Wearing a sword in Public. I practice martial arts but focus on swordplay, throwing knives and throwing axes. Obviously it sounds odd but I feel "naked" when I'm not wearing a sword and there are several times in a day when I expect to feel the weight of my sword on my hip and I look down to realize that its not there.	"This job represents a paycheck to me. I will do a good job, the best that I am capable of, but honestly, I am here because of the pay."
Reddit, we have been talking about movies but I'm more of an avid reader. What is the best book you have ever read?	Invisible Monsters by Chuck Palahniuk. Such an amazing book. I will also add The Hunger Games trilogy, I absolutely loved them.	The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster I can't really describe what I liked about it so much, the whole book is basically just about exploring literal interpretations of idioms and expressions in the English language. It somehow makes puns actually funny, and basically every line in the book is quotable.
If I were to blow up the moon, who would prosecute me and on what grounds?	Or maybe blowing up the moon would cause the earth's orbital system and gravitational pull to fuck up and/or potential implosion of part of this solar system which means sad face bye bye planet earth. Because science.	If I had the weaponry to blow up the moon, who the fuck is going to be able to prosecute me
What TV show moment made you think, 'enough' and switch the show off forever?	Around the second episode of Supergirl when I realized it was just pushing SJW agendas. I'm all for equality, but I just wanted a superhero show, not a bunch of guys getting their asses kicked by a girl over and over again while she compares herself to Superman. Just fly and shoot lasers out of your eyes and shit, don't have dialogue specifically to point out the enemy thinks Superman is better than Supergirl cause she's a chick.	Here's an oldie. The episode of ER when Dr. Ramano catches a resident physician smoking weed, but never reports him because a helicopter explodes and falls on him.
What store or restaurant will you go out of your way to NOT give your business to?	CVS. They have a lease on the entire building where my dad has his bagel shop/deli and gave him a sublease. They won't renew the sublease and gave us until November to find a new location and to get out of our current one, but it's okay because capitalism right? Fuck CVS.	Canadian Tire. When I got my oil changed, they didn't put the cap back on. My car was parked overnight in my dad's driveway... when I went out the next morning, oil had completely wrecked it. Went back. Demanded they re-do my oil and pay to fix his driveway. They wouldn't. I have never gone back.
What illegal thing have you done for the right reasons?	Ignored frivolous laws such as drinking age as everyone was 18 and keys were already taken. Go figure, adults can handle themselves if treated like adults	My brother owns a commercial printing business. Like print marketing and media B2B stuff. All of his equipment is capable of printing thousands of pages in a few minutes. I get my college textbooks for free through the VA. You might be able to see where this is going... I would take my textbooks apart at the spine and scan them into PDF and print them in bound copies and gave them to my classmates in each class. I even had some students want to take classes with me because I could do this for them.
If a giant ring was built on mile high supports around the earth at the equator and the supports were simultaneously destroyed, would the ring just float there?	As an engineer let me provide an emphatic NO WAY IN HELL. First, I doubt there's a material that could support itself in such a shape. Second, if it's a perfect circle then some parts of the ring would be lodged in moutains while other parts would be in the water. Third, the earth's gravity is not consistent, also the moon has a significant influence, so the net force would be varying across the ring. Fourth, weather, the sun's rays, insects, birds, condensing water vapor would all disturb the ring. That's just the first four things that come to mind.	If it was made of a sufficiently strong material, possibly. The problem would come from tidal gravitational forces. Gravity isn't constant all across the earth, so it would probably end up hula-hooping around the equator of the earth. Whilst doing this it would probably destroy everything on the face of the earth by smashing through the crust and triggering massive earthquakes and releasing massive amounts of magma. Not a cheery thought, but when you think about it if the hoop didn't fall apart, this would probably happen.
What's your way of asking if the person you meet is single/attracted to you?	I would like to think that a "normal" person picks up the signals and vibes and doesn't have to flat out ask. That's just creepy.	This is how I do it: have awkward conversations with her for a year and then never find out if she was ever into you.
What is one thing you will never understand?	How people can live their whole lives In this bubble called religion. There's so much beauty and wonder and enlightenment to experience around us. Not saying being religious means you can't appreciate beauty but it defensively impedes in the absolute jaw dropping feeling you get when you realize how you and everything around you is possible. It's so sad to see people die not fully experiencing these revelations. I stand in reverence to the world around me and I will never for a second overlook the majestic existence around us. And no answer will arrogant answers like those that religions offer will ever satisfy me.	the stock market. i mean like on wall street where they are all waving their arms about and shouting down phones. how the fuck do they know whats going on?
What items or styles of clothing are your biggest turn on?	Let's face it. Most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're cavemen. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing eight-inch heels. And to be wearing see-through underpants. But for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.	Oh man. I went to a public school but the prefects had to wear dress shoes, button up, a tie and a blazer. At the end of the school day, this boy I sat next to would unbutton the top two, loosen his tie and roll up his sleeves. He was a swimmer and had some great arms. I was into it, just one more thing to look forward to at the end of the day
What is Your Weirdest Public Bathroom Experience?	In an airport, had to deuce. Right after I sat down, a voice from the next stall says, "Hey, what's up?" I was very confused, but didn't want to be rude, so I replied, "not much..." Then the voice says, "What are you doing right now?" I say, "Uh, poopin?" So then he says, "Look, I'm gonna have to call you back. The guy in the next stall won't quit talking to me."	I was at my local mall and wanted to use the restroom before going home. There were three stalls in the restroom. Stall one. The seat and floor were covered in piss. Pass. Stall two. There was a pile of toilet paper stacked higher than the bowl. No thanks. Stall three. The handicap stall. I open the door and see one guy on his knees blowing another guy. On second thought, I think that I can wait until I get home.
When I was a kid my parents would yell at me for letting the shower run for a good 2 minutes before I got in. I never really got why. Reddit what are some things you were scolded for as a child that you're just now realizing why?	Wait. What? My roommates and I use so much fucking water. Sometimes I let the shower run for 10 minutes because k get distracted while its warming up. Water bills never exceed 20. What kind of water do you have?	My brother and I used to complain that mother was making pasta 4-5 times a week for dinner. We made a joke of it and god bless her for laughing along with us. She was just getting her small business off the ground at the time and money was tight. We had no idea pasta was the cheap dish that saved her both time and money.
What is something everyone complains about but nobody realises is an easy fix?	Online dating - Just stop being shitty to each other and learn to deal with rejection and how to reject people.	A significant quantity of computer issues can be resolved with a restart. Restart your machine before you call tech support.
DIVORCEES of Reddit, What could you or your S.O have done to save your marriage?	Communicate! communicate, communicate! Not a divorcee, but both my parents have been married 3 times (once to each other and then both to two other people). So I have been subject to many marriages and divorces. Also, don't get married because you are lonely and afraid of being alone, or because of a pregnancy... Side note: I am happily married and have 2 wonderful children	Wait til we grew up a bit more before we got married. 20 years old is mighty young and we thought we knew what we were doing. But that wasn't the case. Regardless, I'm happy we didn't save the marriage. We aren't right for eachother.
"Extreme" people of reddit. What's the best/worst thing about being really tall/short, Obese/Skinny, large/small breasted etc?	I'm just really, really attractive and wealthy. Does that count? Things are pretty swell for me. Can't think of any downsides.	I'm a really short guy, and not having respect is absolutely one of the worst things. I'm student teacher for an 8th grade class and 90% of the boys are significantly taller than I am, so it's hard for them to actually take me seriously. Just in general I find it extremely difficult to be taken seriously or even gain respect.
What will millennials be very intolerant of in the future?	Criticism. They can't take it now and it's probably only going to get worse when they are in "the real world."	It's a fairly difficult thing to answer, and my friends talk about it often. The change that millennials will not tolerate is probably nearly impossible to guess, as the technology that revolutionizes the era has nothing from the past informing it. For example, many older generations are cannot tolerate internet activities (Twitter, memes, email). However, nobody could have predicted what the internet would become, and many people never saw it coming. So the next change we cannot accept as well probably hasn't been invented, and it is unlikely to predictable. My best guess would be AI relationships. Soon, we will have AI within our phones, and those AI will be unique and know everything about us. It's not unlikely that people will develop feelings for them.
What is your number one piece of advice for future college freshmen?	Party. Studying won't make you as happy as everyone says. I have money and great job prospects, but I'd trade it all for actually having lived in college.	Coming from a dropout, go to class. Seriously, go to class. No one dogging you to be there creates so much temptation to blow it off. Don't. And no matter what you did in High School, you aren't prepared. It doesn't matter if you aced every test without studying. You will have to study in college. The tests aren't rote memorization, they test to see if you really know the material. Remember that you are there to learn and to earn a degree, not have fun or discover yourself. That may happen, but school takes precedence. Don't waste your parents or your own money.
What was a loophole that you found and exploited the hell out of?	When vending machines first started accepting credit cards you could swipe your card, select a drink and when the little drink pod starts moving to collect your drink hit cancel. The cancel button would stop the card transaction but not the machine so you could get free drinks. Was a sad day when it stopped working.	When i was in college a guy actually bought a calculator ($30) from the bookstore and just pressed the buttons through the plastic packaging and returned it at the end of the semester.
Atheist people of reddit, what made you think that ''god is fake''?	The devil. Edit:Ok let me be more clear on this everyone talks about how gods are real or not when talking about a religion. well growning up in a religious environment means you delt with devil to, everytime shit hits the fan you hear people say the devil made me do this, when bad shit happens it's the works of the devil l, the devil is out to get you, devil this, devil that and it never made any sense to me. the dEvIl mAdE mE dO It shit was atter bullshit their was no invisible dude making decisions on your behalf or messing around with people's life. then you introduce logic and reasoning and gods doing the same thing doesn't make any more sense	TBH when I discovered that santa isn't real I just started naming fictional characters to my parents and ended with Jesus. "No no, *He's the only real one.*" Mmhm, sure.
What do you wish was less socially accepted?	Religion. Stories passed down by people who didn't know where the sun went at night. Modern day people believing these stories as timeless truths. Religion is holding back the human race from progressing.	Being a horrible parent. I've seen way too much shit fly because parents were 'too exhausted to act correctly' or 'it's their first kid so they don't know'. Bitch you've duct taped your 4-year old to the wall because you wanted to ground him but can't be arsed to stay at home and supervise like you're supposed to. She told us nonchalantly while we were out drinking.
What purchase did you instantly regret?	Deadpool. I bought it without seeing it because Reddit said it was so awesome and hilarious. Are you people all 12?	I bought Metallica's newest album on CD a while back. When I got home, I realised I didn't have even one device with a disk drive.
Reddit, can you help us find the lost episode of Dexter's Lab, Dexter's Rude Removal?	It's pretty obnoxious how they're claiming reddit took all the credit for finding Crybaby Lane when in fact 4chan had nothing to do with it. The reddit thread's still available, where there's complete proof that a redditor had it.	"Mom calls 'Dexter...Dee Dee....LUNCH!' 'AW SHIT...I AM FUCKING STARVED!'" I would give my firstborn son to hear Dexter say that.
What’s the sluttiest thing you’ve done?	Stayed up all night with my girlfriend, then drove down the street to my other girlfriend’s house. Acted like I was tired from being up so early. Honestly it was really stressful and made me feel like a terrible person so I do not recommend it	When I was working at Renaissance faire (f24, 18 back then) I had to flirt a lot to make sales. I was flirting with this lady (25-ish?) and she said she would buy something from me for a kiss. I leaned over the counter and kissed her. She then bought $600 worth of pewter (each thing was $150-$300) from me
Men of reddit:What is the most memorable compliment you have ever received?	I am not an handsome man, but once a girl I was at the time talking to said I have a really nice sounding voice. I don't receive a lot of compliments, yes.	Me, to a patient: So you been pooping alright? no diarrhea? patient (old lady, 84): I have diarrhea me: What color is it? yellow? black? her: It's green. Like your eyes not even mad
Have you ever had a bad gut feeling that something was off so you left, only to find out that something did happen and what's the story?	Was at a mall and suddenly noticed a bunch of black teenagers everywhere. I high tailed it out of there, and the next day, their violence and theft was on the local news.	I had a feeling this guy I dated once was cheating on me... I asked him if he'd tell me if there was something going on, because I was afraid to ask outright. He told me I was crazy and that I was terrible for doubting him, etc etc.. I felt terrible and really did feel like I was crazy. Broke up with him a year later for other reasons and that's when he decided there was something he just HAD to tell me. I was right, but that didn't make it any easier to stomach.
What things do people of the opposite sex do that makes you think "that's why they're still single"?	Make fun of feminism, women's rights, are loud advocates of Men's Rights, etc. Mate, there's a reason women don't talk to you and it's not because they're assholes. It's you.	Telling a story or dominating conversation with a topic that everyone else involved is clearly not interested in any more.
Teachers, what is the silliest name you've ever seen a child have?	This story comes from my mom, during her time as attendance clerk. Duties included registration of upcoming kindergartners and students who moved. A rising kindergartner was named La-a. Mom ran this by several folks in the office but none were familiar with the pronunciation. Lah-uh? Luh-uh? Lah-ah? Lahhh? Finally, the girl comes in with her mother, so they ask. And damned if the question didn’t make her mad, like she has to explain the obvious every single time. “It’s Ladasha! The dash ain’t silent” Edit: what the flying f***. I just read the comment above mine. This has happened more than once? My story took place in SC.	I taught English in China for a while and there are SO MANY. Off the top of my head the silliest were: * Brown * Pizza * Milk * Apple * JJ Kangaroo * Shlitty * Rainbow * Supperman
Which fictional character had the worst life during the run of their tv show, book, etc.?	Jonah. Up against an omnipotent, murderous psychopath who ruins his life while forcing him to worship his tormentor. Bible fiction is dark.	Rickety Cricket from "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia." He starts out as a young priest, but his life takes a dramatic downturn when he meets the gang.
"She got a big booty so I call her big booty" It boggles my mind to think rappers make millions of dollars off of lyrics like this. What other mindless rap lines have you heard that make you shake your head in disbelief?	How about Gucci Mane's song "Lemonade". Here's an excerpt from the song. *Lemonade diamond bracelet, put it in your face,* *Lemonhead diamond earrings I wore yesterday,* *I'm pimpin' where I'm winnin', that's just how I'm chillin',* *I'm smoking grits and sellin' chickens, corvette painted lemons.* Seriously, how is this called music?	Ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass
What are people in your country proud of that actually kind of sucks?	Rednecks driving around with big US flags on the back of their 4x4 truck and wearing a don't tread on me shirt.	Our working culture. Some people take pride in the fact that we get screwed by our employers. Its not admirable or healthy to work 51 40+ hour weeks out of the year for shit pay and zero/terrible benefits but if you don't you're considered lazy.
What movie plot-hole is impossible to ignore?	I haven't read the books, and I would hope that it is somehow addressed in the books, but my old roommate and I once watched the Lord of the Rings trilogy back to back with all the extended scenes, and my question is this: Why not just fly the fucking eagles to Mt. Doom in the first place? Eleven hours! Eleven hours of my life! ;D hehehe	The Santa Clause If none of the adults believe in Santa wouldn't they wonder where the fuck all the presents came from every year?
What is the scariest thing going on in your life right now?	I've missed the past two chem labs due to an injured ankle. With only two more labs left in the semester, I don't know when I'm going to be able to make them up. I also don't know if I'm going to be able to go to the last two because I don't know when my ankle is going to get better. I'm going to college out of my home state and my health insurance isn't excepted by a lot of doctors around my school, so it hasn't been fully diagnosed.	My teeth are rotting out of my skull and I'm only 28. Worst part is that my teeth are genetically fucked...they look like I've been doing meth for the past decade and I've never even seen the shit.
What's the last sentence you said to another human being?	Currently, "babe please" Which is the last plead I sent to my boyfriend while he was saying he was going to kill himself and its been hours and I'm drunk now and life is shit fucking kill me :)	In person? "*Have a nice day, love you*" In writing? "*Nah, he's not a twat. He's a bit intense, I think because of how much he cares about his art? He's not a cunt, he just comes across a little bit like one at times.*"
What is something that people complain about that makes you roll your eyes?	Bernie Sanders supporters. Yeh, the Democrats probably were against him. But guess what, he wasn't a fucking Democrat. He was the one who thought he could just waltz into a party and take it over - he knew the risks. Also, he would have been slaughtered in a general election - like it or not, America doesn't elect socialists.	I had the mother of a student complain bitterly in front of students and faculty that her daughter wasn't chosen as the principal soloist in the school's talent show. Her daughter didn't want any part of it - and couldn't match pitch, let alone sing the lead part. Still, her mother insisted that she be considered and given the role, and *threatened* to yank her out of the school system if we didn't agree. All of us, even her daughter, rolled our eyes.
What’s the most hypocritical thing you’ve ever seen or have heard?	People who eat meat who have never killed an animal for meat. Idk if that’s hypocritical but I think everyone should. What is hypocritical is people who say hunting is no longer necessary, have never killed an animal, but love slobbering over a burger. Edit: I’ve had a few people try and compare not having killed an animal for meat to not having grown crops so therefore they shouldn’t eat corn or some such similar comparisons. As someone who has gone from not having killed an animal for meat to having killed an animal for meat, the message I’m trying to convey is that it changes your perception of what meat is and life as a whole. And I believe that is an important revelation.	My mom's boss's wife, she constantly complains about how poor they are even though she spends like 4-5 hours a day just shopping. My mom showed me her monthly spending and it turns out she spends like $3000 just on shopping alone Edit: She does bookkeeping for the boss and the boss's wife so that's how she knows what they spend money on. To add, since people say it's not hypocritical: she'd say stuff like "we don't have enough money to pay staff etc". But would immediately turn around and go blow $200 that day
What is the most childish act you've seen by a full-grown adult?	Ok, story time. So the brother of my father alway had a shitty behaviour. One chrismas will his daughter was playing with the gift my parent gave her, my uncle ain't gave us a thing (to my 2brothers and I). One of my brother (being 14 at that time), after leaving send him a texto saying "hey thanks for the gift we didn't get!!!!" (ofc my uncle didn't spoke to us after it). Few month laters when my brother and my father where in the house of my Grandparent, my uncle came in. That fucking asshole of 27y/o wanted to beat my brother (being 15y/o), for the texto.	My dad, he's an immigrant from Guatemala, moved here when he was 26. Since he was a little kid, he's dreamt of going to Disneyland. When my older brother graduated from marine corps boot camp in San Diego, we as a family went to Disneyland. My dad (who at the time just turned 50) was smiling running around with my 10-year old little sister trying to go on all the rides and hurrying the whole family. His smile proved to me that it was one of the happiest days of his life.
Wouldn't it make more sense to consider a fetus a person at the point that the fetus could be removed from the womb and survive?	Given that a fetus is functionally a parasite until at least 24 weeks, when through modern medicine and heroic efforts, there is at least *some* chance of surviving outside the womb, I simply cannot wrap my head around folks arguing the conception-to-24 week point as personhood. If you'd like to approach this from a different perspective, take fetal surgery (19 to 30 weeks). The anesthetics are given to the *mother*. If the fetus were able to survive outside the uterus, this would not be the case. So, exactly what is the basis for a sane argument here?	Thats called viability and it occurs roughly at the third trimester, at which point abortion is no longer a legal option. Edit: apparently i am wrong about when viability occurs.
Military People of Reddit, Area 51 guards, how do you feel about the September 20th Raid?	I can't believe people have actually been showing up.....well, here's to hoping the military wipes out a good majority of these idiots. Just less stupid people on the planet.	My uncle is attending with his search and rescue squad just to be ready. Some dumb people with no food or water are going to get lost and need help.
Teachers of Reddit, what's the worst case of helicopter parenting you've seen?	When a chinok tried to convince me that his "angel" c130 was the victim after he murdered a village of viet cong The c130 also had a tracker installed	I had a mother ask for her son to eat his lunch alone in a separate room because she wasn't sure she wanted him socializing yet with his classmates. He has only socialized with her around, so he wasn't "ready" to do it solo. She was on that kids back every time he walked in the door for his lessons. Ever 10 years later, I still think about the little guy who is a teenager now. I have a feeling his mother never backed off.
Doctors and nurses of Reddit, have you ever witnessed a couple have a child that was obviously not the father's? If so, what happened?	Funny how the common theme in these threads are roastie women banging black guys, who are never around to actually look after their offspring. EDIT: the best part is how many people think this is not true.	My husband and I were visiting our friends who’d just had a baby (we are the godparents) and we were standing in the hallway talking to both sets of grandparents. Well, apparently the hospital has a rule that only 5 visitors may be present in the hallway, but the security guard had let all 6 of us in for some reason and we didn’t realize it. This nasty nurse comes up to us, notes that there are six of us, tells us someone will have to leave _immediately_, and then turns to my husband and says, “Oh, are you the daddy?” Without missing a beat, he says, “That’s what we’re all trying to figure out here.” She gets a look of horror on her face and backs away.
What is the most disgusting or disturbing thing you have found out about a roommate or family member, but kept to yourself as to not embarrass them?	Someone older in the family has a taste for teen porn. Edit: Not sure why I was downvoted. Anyway, I found this out when using the family computer and 20-30 videos were saved in a folder. I accidentally found the folder when searching the entire drive for some old videos I had on there.	My dad likes being fucked in the ass with a twelve inch hard plastic dildo. He is also secretly a cross dresser and describes himself to his online friends as a lesbian trapped in a man's body. I found pictures.
What's a useful skill to learn in the period of time between leaving school and starting uni?	How to make your own beer, wine, chicha, basically just alcohol. Most of you will be drinking quite a bit during your college years and it'll be worth your while to know how to make some alcohol when you don't have money to buy any (or turn out like me and love brewing). I highly highly discourage anyone to have a still for making hard liquor in your college years. Risky to make in every regard and unlikely you'll be able to hide it. If anyone is interested in a run down of how to do any of this either PM me or ask for a reply. Best of luck to anyone perusing eduction or anything else to better yourselves!	Learn to cook. It's damn expensive to buy ready meals/going out to eat every day. And if you want to save time, learn to enjoy eating the same meal for a whole week. Then make a big pot of something, and eat that for the week.
I'm reading a novel on the topic and I really got me thinking. If there's a plague that wipes out 99.99% of humanity, what do you, as a survivor do to rebuild?	I would live on and try to NOT repopulate the planet. Why bring children into such a horrible world that is destroyed?	I'd try to rescue as many "how to" books from the libraries as possible before they burned (something post-apocalyptic scenarists don't seem to take into account is that without people to keep the water mains pressurized and man the fire stations, big cities are going to burn to ashes in fairly short order). Primarily books about tools and tools that make tools. A bunch of stuff from the 18th and 19th centuries. Get as many as possible and disseminate as widely as possible. I think/hope that would give humanity a jump-start on getting back to an industrialized society, otherwise it's doomed to several centuries of subsistence farming and feudalism, which is a big pain in the ass. What Man has done, Man can aspire to. Such as going to the moon.
With 2012 coming to a close, what has been the high point and low point of your year?	High point is telling my parents I don't want to be a Christian anymore, low point feeling like I want to give up on my acting degree coz I wasn't good enough	High point: Got married. Low point: Wife diagnosed with cancer one month later. All in all, the shitty wins. Edit: Wow, thanks for the words of support and well-wishing. Made my evening!
What's the most irrational thing your pet is afraid of?	My dog is scared of chewing gum.She hates when someone blows a bubble and it pops. Even the chewing whacks her out.	A watermelon. It's ridiculous, actually. Brought a watermelon home and my dog barked at it and eyed it warily for like half an hour. Dogs are weird.
Parents of Reddit, when did you realize that your child was no longer a child?	When she called me from a payphone in Nevada crying and saying she'd spent her last quarter making this call. Essentially what happened was the guy she was traveling with had bailed on her and stolen her wallet. Problem was she was now stranded 3 hours away from college, and she needed a loan to get back home. I asked how much needed and she said "I need about tree fiddy" It was right about that time that I realized that the girl I was speaking to was really eight stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleolithic era. I said "God damnit Loch Ness monsta! I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!"	When she was about 23 and out of the blue apologize for wasting 36 months of time in college without even getting an associates degree. She is 29 now, her and her husband are doing a great job raising a daughter and she is the operations manager for a business that has five hardware stores.
what's the most hurtful thing anyone from the opposite sex has said to you?	When I told my ex boyfriend he couldn't come visit my foster family with me (I was adopted a long time before this, but am still close with my foster family) because they had a new girl, and she was making lies up about people. (Told the ministry my foster sister beat her up. She didn't.) He responded with "When you say I can't visit it is like you are saying I will never understand what it is like to be in foster care"	My now ex wife." I'm tired being a wife, I'm tired of being a mother, I'm tired of playing house. I never loved you,I just wanted out of my parents house." That was after 16 years of marriage. What was a really good 16 years, or so I thought. So I raised my kids from that point by myself. Because I love my kids.
Gamers of reddit, what game actually lived up to the hype?	League of Legends. I'm sorry but this game is great. So satisfying. I've been playing it for like 5 years. Climbing the ladder. You have to trudge through tons of bullshit to get the good stuff, but dang it's great. Half Life 2. I built a new computer for that. Never regretted it for a second. It was so mind-blowing in its time. Vanilla WoW. I sold all of my DAoC accounts to build a computer for it. Was max lvl in a few months. Raiding. PvP. omg. Sucks to see what the game has become.	Knights of the Old Republic. They've been trying to get it back to that with each new game. Nothing has captured the original's perfection.
I'm a 14 year old kid and my dad is abusing my mom. They both deny they have a problem. What do I do? What are your experiences with this? What resources do I contact?	Fake. However, coming to Reddit is a good idea. You get so much attention and karma for abusive relationships on here.	What ever you do, do NOT turn to drugs as a way of coping. Find healthy coping mechanisms at any cost. How you learn to cope now will stay with you for the rest of your life. Source: my life and others around me.
What are you just sick and fucking tired of?	Hearing about the Black Lives Matter movement. Yes I get it, the cops are out to get you. The problem for me in supporting your group is you can't tell me that black lives matter when you constantly post videos of black people victimizing other black people. If black lives matter, then maybe you should teach and preach that idea to your OWN black community before asking the rest of the public to respect and value your life. If you can't even have your own community respect black lives, stop asking other people to. Yes some cops are dirty and grimy but so are members of your own community. Stop asking other people outside of your community to respect you when you can't even convince people in your own community to respect themselves.	Texting and driving. I don't know why people insist they can pay attention to the road and their phone simultaneously. Plus, they risk their lives and others lives when they do this.
What experience completely differed from what you were expecting it to be like?	first time smoking marijuana....nothing happened, no high at all but my friends (in college) got high...tried it again...same result...that was it for that experiment :(	Putting on weight, I always thought I'd never let myself but it kind of just happens slowly, slowly enough that it's easy to convince yourself it's not happening at all
What's the dumbest thing you've ever been told by a medical professional?	He said I had cancer, just because my hand is bigger than my face! When I raised my hand to my face, to compare the size, and verify the difference for myself, he killed my family while my eyes were obstructed! All in all, it was not a very helpful doctor's visit.	As a child in the 70's, I had horrible eye allergies that made my eyelids and skin around my eyes red, puffy and itchy, and they would sometimes swell shut and/or stick together. For 3 years the doctor told us it was "ringworm" and gave us medicine for "ringworm". The 4th year, there was a new doctor - he took one look at the chart, one look at my face, and said "I don't know what the previous doctor was thinking, this is just allergies." He gave me a shot and the next day everything was fine.
What is something you used to find completely repulsive, but now find kind of okay... or maybe even pleasant?	Kissing with tongue. I have a thing about tongues; they gross me out big time. But after 10 months of my boyfriend shoving it in my mouth, I've learned to tolerate, sometimes enjoy, the mouth tentacle.	Coffee. Thought it was disgusting for the longest time, then I got a job that started at 4 in the morning, so I needed it for survival. I started out getting extra extra sugar and cream, now I'm down to just a tiny bit of sugar and a splash of milk. And I drink ~6 cups a day.
What is your biggest "WTF BRAIN?" moment?	I have aphasia. I wrote program, that read all the names from a database and showed their absence. When I finally was done, I found out that only was two people out of 650, who had a very common name. So I said to my friends "We are actually only two who's name is Lene". It took me 5 seconds while my friends laughed at my mistake to realize it.	Driving down the highway... "Hey you should totally crash into that wall. I bet if you hit it at the right angle you'll do some sweet spins" Like, I'm not depressed, I've never been suicidal, but I could not for the life of me shake the thought of smashing into that wall and doing a sick spinout.
What are some common abbreviations used on reddit that a new redditor should know?	ELIW: Explain like I'm a woman TIF: Today I fapped NSFE: Not safe for autists You should use those all the time of you want to fit in.	FTFY - fixed that for you OP - Original Poster OC - Original content AMA - Ask me anything IAMA - I Am A ELI5 - Explain like I'm 5 NSFW/NSFL - Not safe for work/life (counterparts SFW/SFL - safe for work/life) TIL - Today I learned IIRC - If I recall correctly TL;DR - Too long; didn't read SO - Significant others DAE - Does anyone else AFAIK - As far as I know SRS - Shit Reddit says IMO - In my opinion (or IMHO - In my humble/honest opinion) ITT - In This Thread MFW - My face when MRW - My reaction when IANAL - I Am not a lawyer IANAD - I Am not a doctor MIC - More in comments YMMV - Your mileage may vary [edit: corrected a mistake, added a couple. Thanks to the thread!]
Today I lost my wallet, and 30 minutes later someone dropped it off at my house without removing anything. What acts of kindness have restored your faith in humanity?	I was at beer fest at Paramount Studios a couple weeks ago. $50 bill dropped out of my pocket and this dude walking past me saw it fall and saw me not notice and immediately called it to my attention. Okay I lied it was me who saw the money fall and told the dude about it.	A couple of reformed hoodlums helped me break into my own car once when I locked my keys in the car. They made a race out of it. The winner: 15 seconds with a coat hanger. "We don't do this stuff any more," they told me, "but we still know how."
What company has forever won your business?	Apple. Ever since my first ipod touch i've loved the interface and simplicity of all apple products and will most likely not have any other phone than an iphone.	Local Bike Shop. I was about to buy a brand new bike for 1200 and the owner of the shop said to hold on and ran upstairs to grab a bike that was a year old but never used, sold it to me at cost. Saved 500 bucks and they've serviced it for free every time I go in. The guys who work on the bikes are just as passionate about riding and fixing bikes. The salesman had greasy hands, I trust people who work on what they sell.
[Serious] Redditors that have tried to commit suicide. How are you?	My third year anniversary of attempt is coming up. I feel much better now. On a good med that keeps my head straight. People need to understand that if someone commits suicide, they are not right in the head.	I'm better now. Thanks for asking. What was in my mind? Hhmmm.... That I was a complete loser. A failure as a son, as a brother, as a student, as a friend. Just a total failure of human being. All I could feel was deeply dark feelings, all i could think was deeply dark thoughts. And I wanted out When I held the gun all I could think was that it was finally time to end the suffering. It was my choice to do it. Mine and mine alone. What stopped me? Nothing....I brought the gun to my head and pulled the trigger but the gun did not fire. What stopped me later? IDK.... I lost my nerve to do it I guess. Later I've become a dad, now my love and dedication to my son keeps me around
What is the worst situation where you didn't realise something until it was too late?	That I had a told a friend to kick me in the balls if I didn't ask a certain girl out by the end of the day and planned to ask her out at the end of the day.	Worked in a cubicle on the far side of the office where nobody else worked. The burrito I had for lunch started gurgling and I let out a pungent fart. 30 seconds later the whole office comes into my cubicle with a cake singing me happy birthday.
What's the "Vaccines cause Autism" of your industry?	Learning styles. Despite a ton of rigorous research, there is no evidence that individual learning styles exist. There are no visual learners, auditory learners, kinesthetic learners. Tell a teacher that, though, and they'll say all those scientists are full of shit.	I train technicians on the installation and usage of x-ray machines. This exchange happens all the time: Me: "You don't want to be that close to the beam while it is exposing." Trainee: "Oh it's fine, I've already had my kids." Apparently there's a common misconception that x-rays will sterilize you even if the beam is not pointed at your junk. I have to then teach these people the effects of radiation on the tissue that is exposed to it. The scary part is that the majority of my trainees have years of experience in radiological devices, years more than me even. I'm just training them on our particular brand.
Hotel works of Reddit...how easily can you identify escorts, prostitutes, drug dealers, human traffickers, or porn stars that may be using your rooms for nefarious acts....Any crazy stories??	I travel a lot for work and therefore stay in a lot of hotels. When on the road, I usually like to find a prostitute and cocaine. Typically, I will get high on cocaine and then have sexual intercourse with the prostitute in my hotel room. More often than not, I end up murdering the prostitute and eating her remains. As a married man, the last thing I need in my life is to be caught being adulterous. It is important to destroy all the evidence. The key to sneaking a prostitute and copious amount of cocaine into a hotel room is to murder and eat the remains of the hotel patron.	People who ask if they can rent the room for half a day. Honestly have never had problems, even being located downtown. The only wild story I have is when a drunk homeless couple managed to sneak into a room and have really loud wild sex, disturbing the whole floor.
What is the worst thing that has ever happened at your school?	I got in a fight and beat up a guy and him and his friends fucking tried to bear mace me and my football teammates.	When i was in high school, one of the popular kids stuck his head out of the escape window on the top of the bus while going through a tunnel. He was decapitated.
What is the most out of place, “what the fuck is this” episode of an otherwise good TV show?	For a long time, I didn't like the episode of The Office when Michael drove his car into the lake. I thought it was a real "jumping the shark" moment for the show. Then he goes back to yell at a prospective client over a gift basket. Very out-of-character for Michael. There are a lot of moments like that in Season 4, but OTOH, I think Jan literally drove him crazy that season, so it explains his behavior a little better.	The Brady Bunch has one where there is a family that adopts a boy and how he misses his buddies from the oprhanage so they adopt them as well. There's very limited scenes with the Bradys at all. It made no sense to me until I found out years later that the storyline was set to be a spinoff show about three adopted mixed race boys or something. But to be packaged within the confines of a Brady Bunch episode confused the hell out of me as a kid.
Non-drinkers, was there one moment where you thought, "Nope, this isn't for me"?	I don't mean to be that dick that always tries to convince non drinkers to drink, but not drinking alcohol because you don't want to throw up and make a complete arse of yourself is like not drinking water because you don't want hyponatremia. I mean, if you don't want to drink, don't drink, but if you use moderation this doesn't happen.	Yeah once I came home drunk to my 2 year old son. I decided I didn't want to be _that_ parent.
Which country do you know absolutely nothing about ?	Being a citizen of the US: All of them. The level of geography / history of other countries taught during school here in the US is vastly different than that of other countries. The US really only focuses on ourselves like a narassistic child...	Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia. I just don't know. Edit: I just got back to see the replies. You guys are awesome. Thanks for enlightening me and everyone else here!
What's the greatest high school prank that you or someone at your school pulled?	Someone bought in 3 sheep; One had the number "1" on it One had the number "2" on it One had the number "4" on it Said sheep were then released in school and quickly apprehended by teachers, however the school was shut for the rest of the day as they hunted for the elusive sheep number "3".	A few years ahead of me, the senior prank was everyone gathering in the cafeteria shouting "Fight! Fight! Fight!" As the teachers tried to pull the mob away from the center, the found that 2 people in the middle were playing Rockem Sockem Robots
Out of no where, my five-year old daughter came to me and said, "How do I know that I'm real and not just a dream of someone else?" What other surprisingly deep questions have you been asked by kids?	My son came to me once and said "dad, how come people repost the same question on askreddit within a month of each other?"	My brother was always very interested in the consciousness of other children when he was a toddler. Whenever there was a baby around, he'd walk up to them and their mother, frown down at the kid when they were shown to him, look at the mother and ask "Do they know they're alive yet?" He creeped a lot of my aunts and my mother's friends out. Never got a good answer, either.
What's something that your family does you once thought was common practice, only to find out it's not?	Honestly, it was actually eating at the table itself. When I was little they said everyone did it. The hard truth dawned upon me when I got like 6 hours of homework every night. They still insisted, but at that point we both knew it was bs.	Not drinking during meals. My mum would always bring me juice right after I finished eating, but we never had drinks on the table. Took me until I was over 12 or 13 to realize other people did drink during meals and I started doing it.
What’s a good book that got turned into a terrible movie?	Unpopular Opinion : The Neverending Story and The Princess Bride are both awful pale imitations of the books. Nostalgia aside, those movies suck.	Could probably fill this thread with Stephen King novels, as for some odd reasons therea re only two types of movies based on Kings´stories; Absoloutly fantastic or absoloutly terrible, no middleground as it seems.
What do you miss from the OLD internet?	Windows XP!!!!!!! Tbh windows 8 and 10 are just horrible. Windows XP is the OS dream. I keep trying to run it on my old computer, but won't work so I'm trying VirtualBox now.	How we used to let the whole video load or buffer and be able to watch it off line later.
What is the nicest secret you know about someone else which they aren't aware you know?	I have a friend who had a problem inside her vagina(it develop wrong or some shit like that I don't know the details) and as a result she can't have regular sex. It's a pretty sensible matter for her and she would probably stop talking to me if she finds out I know. But I don't really care about it and her friendship is nice.	I know a retired couple that has restored and now maintains an abandoned cemetery. They've brought it back to life, so to speak. It was all overgrown and full of weeds. Many of the tombstones were toppled over. Now, the cemetery is manicured, with grave markers standing upright and the rusted wrought-iron fence painted. There are flowers in bloom and plantings throughout - all thanks to this generous couple who ask for nothing in return, including recognition.
Gym trainers of Reddit, what’s the worst mistake you see people repeatedly do when exercising?	Not a trainer, but locking your knees during leg press. Thats a great way to make sure your leg bends the wrong way.	Doing bicep curls and using mostly their back. If you can't have a tight core and control the movement with your arms, it's too much weight. Stop lifting with your ego and do the right weight. A few cheat curls at the end of a set is fine, Arnold even recommends it, but if your whole set is cheat reps...
What is the smartest thing you have seen an animal do?	Convince humans to feed and house it and not only watch it poo, but then have the humans willingly pick up the poo with their hands. All in exchange for letting the humans touch it.	My cat can operate the recliner, turn on/off the faucet, open doors, turn off lights, and defeat her food dispenser (she found the button that dispenses regardless of the timer). At this point, it's like having a fat, furry roommate.
What movie scene hits you hard every time?	Dammit people use spoiler tags or warn us or something! Ive had like three movies ruined for me with less than a hundred comments.	The scene in Big Fish, where he drops his father into the river. Closely followed by the funeral of his father.
I lost my sister to heroin this morning. What are the best charities to donate to that help treat drug abuse?	Use the money for charity to buy super crime-fighting equipment and take to the streets. Become the Heroin Fighter we need!	This might sound counter intuitive, but we should legalize heroin. Which is safer, heroin from a regulated producer in a supervised environment with trained staff on hand, or getting it from a criminal and hiding away somewhere? With prohibition in place, the substance is more dangerous because the purity is unknown, the environment is less safe because the user has to hide and keep it secret rather than have someone watching out for them, and the people selling it are more dangerous because they can't use legal methods to settle disputes, they are already criminals, so getting away with violence does not increase their risk of getting arrested significantly enough, and they also have to protect themselves from people they think might tell the authorities, and they usually do it by killing them. Prohibition also makes the sharing of needles more common. Basically, prohibition makes the situation worse, not better.
Reddit, have you ever experienced a single moment of clarity that made you realize you don't want to be friends with a particular person any longer?	I helped a friend who was struggling financially get a job. For three months I made sure his schedule was cushy so he could both spend time on his school work and see his family often. We had a 90 day hiring bonus that was offered to anyone who brought in a new employer and since I brought him on that made me eligible for the bonus (a very nice $500). I never told him about the bonus, because I honestly didn't want the situation to get awkward or him ask me to split it with him. So, coincidentally he quit exactly a week after the 90 days, forcing the HR department to give me the bonus and make me look like I purposefully worked their system to receive it. He's damaged my credibility at work after all I did for him, the asshole.	I had a friend where everything I got into, he got into more. I loved climbing so he went to El Capitan. I liked a girl, he dated her. I liked cooking, he took cooking classes. As soon as I gave it up, he moved on too. I told him one day: "I have a lot of hobbies, but your hobby is being better than me."
What is the saddest episode of a comedy sitcom that you have ever seen?	The episode of Futurama where Fry is about to bring back his old dog, but decides the dog lived a full life without him and would be selfish of Fry to bring him to the future. The dog waited out in front of the pizza place where Fry worked for the rest of its life.	I may be dating myself here, but the last episode of M.A.S.H. had me bawling. One of the greatest shows ever made.
Guys, what do girls do that they think is "being cute", but in reality is the furthest thing from it?	Wearing my clothes. Fuck off, I like that hoodie/ random article of clothing. Don't need you wearing it and getting it dirty.	My girlfriend thinks it's cute to be indecisive. She'll know what she wants to eat, but pretend for an hour that she doesn't because it's what girls are "supposed to do" to be cute. Look babe, you want pancakes, I know you want pancakes, you ALWAYS want pancakes, just TELL ME you want the damn pancakes.
I crapped my pants and realized I have the perfect wife. Reddit, what defining moments made you realize your wife/significant other was the one for you?	It's not gross... But when my girl started kissing a hot girl friend of ours and it led us taking her home for a wild fmf hookup...I knew I would spend the rest of my life with her. I honestly feel like I'm the luckiest man on the planet. p.s. we've been together for almost 4 yrs and it's still as exciting as when we first met.	After two years of long distance dating (West to East Coast) my lovely fiancee (now) flew across the country and a day later we moved in to our new apartment together. **4 Days later**, the searing back pain I thought was a pulled muscle from incorrectly moving boxes sends me to the emergency room. Turns out I have cancer and a tumor on my spine. I am admitted directly to the oncology ward and don't get to leave for 3 months while they blast chemo through me. My wonderful lady unpacks and sets up our apartment, cooks me dinner every night so I don't have to eat hospital food, sleeps on a cot next to my bed at the hospital and does every other conceivable thing she could possibly do to help me through it all. You better believe I proposed!
Parents of Reddit, what was your, "NO WAY is this person dating my child" moment?	My daughter was going to her junior prom with a boy I didn't know. I figured that she is intelligent so this kid couldn't be all bad. He pulls up on a motorcycle and this is no boy it is a 20 year old man. So I bring this guy into my house and ask him to step into my room. Once we are in my room, I open up my closet and the guy asks me. Dude, what is that? And I tell him it's called a Serious tag the OP should have used one.	I got a phone call one time, it was some dude saying "Look, I'm dating your daughter and you can't stop us we are in love-" and then I cut him off with my laughing and was like I'm 17 bitch! Ain't got no kids
People of reddit, instead of missed hints what hint(s) did you catch that got you laid?	She said "Oh don't you dare look back, Just keep your eyes on me" I said "You're holding back" then she said "Shut up and dance with me" I got laid that night.	I was playing Halo with a bunch of people in my dorm, and this one otherwise-polite girl kept humping my corpse. We're married now.
What was probably really weird the first time someone ever did it?	Sex itself. Probably took some time to figure out which hole caused the mini human to come out of 270 days later too	Made coffee. "What...what you got there, Ray?" "I FOUND THESE AWESOME BEANS AND ROASTED THEM TIL THEY TURNED BLACK THEN I GROUND THEM INTO DUST AND THEN IM GONNA POUR BOILING HOT WATER OVER THE DUST AND DRINK WHATS LEFT YOU WANT SOME DAVE?!" "...I'm good, Ray."
Medical professionals of Reddit, what was a time where a patient ignored you and almost died because of it?	I have now realised, because of this thread, how much i hate America. Im glad i live in a country where theres Free healthcare.	Had a throat cancer patient, we offered him surgery to remove the tumor (it was a fairly conservative surgery) he left because he didn't want a mutilating surgery and his daughter in law had been studying magnet therapy and "she was quite good with it" (his words) he came back a year later, and was out of reach from any treatment, his cancer was so advanced that there was nothing we could do for him.
IT workers of Reddit, what's your story where a user actually impressed you?	I helped a girl a few months back, with setting up email on her phone. She seemed nice, fit, and athletic - just my type. We chatted and had some laughs and such. She then turned around and said her good bye, and just then, I saw her seemingly loose fitting one piece overall jean short shorts were riding up her crotch so high that I got a perfect glance of her bare ass cheeks. Very very impressive.	Well, on my first job there was a guy who developed a script that made Excel being able to execute any program inside of it. That way, he could play games, watch movies and whatnot and in the logs of the system, it would appear that we was simply using excel the whole time. He went to another company and never shared the script with anyone.
What's dirtier than we think yet never think twice to clean?	To not think twice means to do something without even considering not doing it. Unless the answer you're looking for is something dirtier that we think, yet everyone always cleans it without even considering not cleaning it, you worded that wrong.	May be just me but under the dishwasher. I recently had my dishwasher break and when I pulled it out to work on it I found unimaginable horror.
Reddit, what is something YOU KNOW you saw, but people say you didn't?	The edge of the earth...spent 7 years in Antarctica and swore to never speak of it but they didn't say shit about typing it	Not happened, but experienced. I was 9 or 10 at the time and I was hanging with a bunch of friends, and we found an old cricket ball and we were chucking it around. It ended up hitting my nose and breaking it, mum took me to a doctor and got it fixed. 2 years later in 6th grade I was telling this story at school and this girl called me a liar and said that my nose did NOT break and I actually have no friends (I wasn't popular at my new school.) I told her I am telling the truth and everyone then proceeds to call me a liar and makes fun of me. Melissa, if you're reading this, go fuck yourself.
In what way did you win/lose the genetic lottery?	Win: Big butt (double edged sword), good boobs, nice eyes. Sense of humor, ultra laid back 99% of the time. Loss: Hair, it's just awful. Generally masculine way of moving/being, despite my tiny stature. Quitter (procrastinator), fall way too hard for people way too fast.	Poor vision, cystic acne, type 2 diabetes, two kidneys in near end stage failure and I just had a quadruple bypass about two and a half weeks ago. I'm 24yo and 150lbs.
What’s a "Let that sink in" fun fact?	That Donald Trump became, and is still President. Under his shadow, we're losing net neutrality, we're taking climate control off of our list of worries, we're reducing national land to sell if off to the highest bidder, we've lost our standing on the global stage....the list can go on and on and on. I am ashamed.	The United States hasn’t minted any new Purple Heart medals since World War II. We’ve been using the stockpile that was prepared in anticipation of a ground invasion of Japan.
What is a cool feature a typical smartphone possess which most people don't know about?	Almost every phone has one dimension that is wider than the other. When shooting video, THAT SIDE GOES UP AND DOWN!!!!!!!	If you are using Gboard on android you can swipe on the spacebar to move the cursor left and right
What is the sluttiest thing that you have ever done that no-one knows?	Summer of '15 I graduated from high school and my family took a trip to Disneyworld. I had made a friend on Tumblr about two/three years prior and she lived in Florida, so one night I met up with her and her then fiance, now husband. We're hanging out in the lounge of my hotel when she messages me "I want you. Threesome?" So five minutes later we're in the handicap stall of the Contemporary Resort, going at it for two and a half straight hours. Best way to lose your virginity.	First time my ex made me cum was in a high school classroom. I think the thrill of being caught is what got me going
So, what are some cool facts about movies you know?	Indiana Jones the first. When the sword wielding guy presenting himself and Indiana drew his gun and shot him... That was not supposed to happen. Harrison ford had the shits so bad he improvised to end the scene... The other actor followed suit and took the dive.	In Titanic, the part where Jack was going to draw Rose, Leonardo DiCaprio's line was supposed to be "Go over on the couch." But obviously, Leonardo was nervous because Kate Winslet was naked in front of him and he awkwardly said "Go over on the bed, uh, the couch." James Cameron thought that it really fit the theme of the scene and kept it. Where's that Oscar now?
What is your "Confession"?	I don't hate sob stories, I just hate people who tell them. Because they want me to feel some form of relatively or sympathy or some form of knowledge about their fucking problems. Everyone has problems. Whoop de fucking do. Everyone has solutions to those problems. That's when I give a fuck about those confessions that you find solutions to those problems. But just bitching and not finding a solution? What a joke.	One time as a kid I was getting ready for bed, wearing just PJs commando, and somehow realized if I put my butt in the air I could relax enough to allow air to enter my anus and then woosh it back out, repeatedly, to make a whistling sound. Then my stepdad walked in on me, and I showed him my incredible discovery and told him how it actually felt pretty good. He told me I should probably keep that to myself and not show the other boys... ever. Joke's on him though, because I show my boyfriends that trick all the time now and they think it's pretty cool.
Reddit, what's the worst/sneakiest/most annoying way a Customer has tried to screw you over?	Unfortunately I deal with sneaky people every day. We have a lot of coupon people shopping at my work. They clear us out of our free after coupon items, sometimes going so far as to bring kids to buy items. They try to pass off coupons for stuff they aren't buying. They will buy anything if they have a coupon (30 tubes of preperation h anyone?). The worst part is when they argue or act like they know store policy better than employees.	In high school I worked a service desk at a supermarket. Whenever somebody returned a small appliance, we always cut open the box to make sure all the parts were with it. One day a guy showed up looking to return an air conditioner. Cut open the box, and there was nothing but a rock inside. He ran out of the store pretty quick.
Guys what's something considered girly but you do anyway?	I piss sitting down. I say it’s because I’m too lazy to stand and lift the seat but it’s actually pretty relaxing.	Having good smelling shampoos and body wash...and some good essential oils to drop in the shower with you...and a variety of all the above...
People who have/had cancer, how did you know something was wrong?	My step-dad and I would always go for afternoon walks in the summer with a summer shandy beer. (We'd call it our summer shandy walks) Once when we were walking, he started getting out of breath and really red in the face. This had been going on for a few weeks and my mom and I had been pestering him for weeks about going to the doctor. He's a stubborn man and insisted he was fine and nothing was wrong. He finally went to see his doctor, then a cardiologist and was told he had a blocked artery. His heart decided to grow a new vein in order to get more blood circulating, but it wasn't helping. He ended up getting a triple bypass heart surgery a few weeks later and is back to being his old self.	My doctor had me get a colonoscopy because of blood in my stool. He thought it might be an ulcer caused by some medication; turned out to be a tumor. Turned out to be a very large stage 1 instead of the stage 2-3 they originally thought. I lucked out big time. I was under fifty, hardly a typical age for it to happen.
What do others like about you that you actually dislike?	I would think ALL answers should be some form of "my willingness to help others" because sometimes you're too weak to say no (working on that myself) and you don't like that, but others like your favors. What else would you have about yourself that others like?	That I'm "intimidating". I would actually really like to have friends, and it sucks to hear people tell you that they resisted the desire to introduce themselves because the way you "seem". I've been told by many other girls that I'm scary, and as a girl it makes me feel very alienated.
What was the saddest realization that you have ever had about yourself or your life?	That I can't be a part of my family and queer at the same time. If I choose my family, i'll never truly be happy because I'll be hiding a part of myself from them. If I choose my queerness, my family is very likely to shun and disown me.	One of the saddest realizations I have ever had about life happened when I was 5. I remember standing in the hallway of my grandmas house on new years eve, and my grandma took the 1990 calendar down from the wall and put up a 1991 calendar. It was then that I realized, I'm never going to see 1990 again. That it's gone now and I can't go back. And it was then that it started to dawn on me that I will actually get old. It was heavy stuff for a little kid, and I still remember that day so clearly.
Men of reddit, what earns your respect that someone does in front of you?	Being straightforward. People who are alpha enough to say what they want and not be a beta bitch about it. Men who are very passive aggressive, avoids conflict and gets petty do not get my respect whatsoever. Looking at you flatmate.	I really respected a guy at work who was temporarily made a supervisor of a second department on top of his current department he supervises. One day I needed something done on my laptop and he was very busy at that moment but he stopped what he was doing, listened very intently and then pulled out a tiny notepad from his shirt pocket and wrote down my request and my phone number. He called me shortly after lunch and took very good care of my request. I was so impressed with his organization and work ethic. At first sight he looks a little bit like a stoner going to a job interview but his leadership immediately shines through once you get to know him.
What do you want to like, but just can't?	Pickles. They smell amazing and I love love love pickled cucumbers but I just can't behind the taste of pickles. I don't get it.	Salad. I feel like I’m in The Truman Show, and everybody in the world is just bullshitting me that they like that crap.
Reddit, what is something you used to be obsessed with, but hate now?	Communism, Socialism and everything left-wing. I used to be one of those "Oh the USSR and China and Cuba and North Korea and Vietnam, those aren't REAL communism" people. I used to think Scandinavia and their scarily socialist ways had it all right. I used to think that privatized ANYTHING was the incarnation of the devil. Yeah, but now I'm a conservative / capitalist.	Dramatic TV shows like CSI. I soaked those shows up in junior high, they are just awful to me now.
Extended hospital stays are usually long, bleak, and boring. What's a good thing you can gift someone currently having one?	Coloring books and puzzle books. I have a rare medical condition where I loose weight to fast. I have to eat about 7,000 calories a day to remain healthy. 10,000 if I need to gain weight. Problem is that I also don't feel hunger. So when I get sick and stop eating, I loose a lot of weight and get sick. Coloring books help calm me down and pass the time.	When my sister was in the hospital with cancer, all she wanted was for me to be there everyday. I usually just read or was on my laptop while she slept most of the time. I’d like to think it was a comfort anyway Edit: thank you for the gold, and for all the nice things everyone’s said!
What was your “Didn’t see that coming” moment?	Damn that’s pretty fucked up. I’d say the surprises me but people are so despicable. I’m sorry that happened to you. 😕	A well-liked coworker that was an excellent at his job went into his supervisor's office for an annual review. The guy came out with tears streaming down his cheeks, having just been told that his job was being eliminated and that there was no other position available for him - an outcome no one would've thought possible.
Martial artists of Reddit, have you ever been in a situation where you had to use your skills/techniques to defend yourself? How did it play out?	Like somethin out of a Fuckin Three Ninjas movie, this guy took a huge swing at me, and I dodged, he nailed his buddy, who I didn't know was going in to grab me, right in the eye. Home boy held on, and the first guy starts throwing sloppy combos, all of which I dodged while being held, and about 99% of which connected with the dickhead who was butthugging me until his lights went out. It was crazy.	An underrated skill learned in all forms of martial arts is how to properly brace yourself and fall. It especially comes in handy when you're drunk.
What is the greatest comeback you've ever heard?	Superman....After Lois lane dies in an earthquake, superman reverses the rotation of the earth going back in time to save her. Greatest comeback ever...	We were in psych class senior year of highschool, and the book mentioned something about orgasms. My friend tried to be funny and asked all innocently "whats an orgasm" with a shit eating grin. Our teachers response: "if you dont know what it is by now, youll never have to worry about it."
What is the weirdest thing you have ever found at a garage sale?	5 birds in a cage (for sale) 7 dashounds (not for sale just that they had 7 dashounds in their back yard)	A copy of The Joy of French Cooking where someone had kept a very tightly written diary around the margins and between lines of text. The diary discussed at length the conspiracies against the author and frequently mentioned the existence of "the last police officer I can trust". At 50 cents, it was a steal.
Redditors who've basically picked up and left to start over somewhere else (i.e. quitting your job without another lined up, moving far away, leaving family/friends): how did it work out for you?	Left home when I was 16. In the 30 years since, i have been homeless many times, fire off jobs, walked off a bunch more and there is one thing I have always known. Things always get better. Also, ended up stress played a major role in everything, I have a fight or flight response when I get really stressed out. And since I don't really like getting violent, I generally walk out while flipping whomever off. Now I live a stress free life and will still walk away from shit if it bothers me too much.	I ended up becoming a homeless drug addict. I was from a much smaller, conservative area. When I got to the city, I discovered drugs were all over the place. I was strung out and homeless in record time.
If someone from the 1950s suddenly appeared today, what would be the most difficult thing to explain to them about life today?	The fact that you can't just give money to a doctor. - You have to have bought insurance a year ago, by law. - You have to find a doctor that accepts it. - You need to have all your paperwork in order, including IRS taxes and current information. - If you can't see the doctor you are assigned, seeing another one will cost you much more. - 80% of the people in a doctor's office are there to file paperwork. They have no idea how to apply a band-aid. Thanks, Obama.	My dad was born just before this time, and hasn't kept up with technology. But he watches movies. I had to explain Skype to him one day. It went a bit like this: "you've seen 2001, right? Remember the scene where the guy talks to his daughter via a screen? That exists now." Edit: I've also used the same thing with star trek to explain tablets.
What uncommon word do you think everybody should know?	sonder n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness	Overmorrow. Technically also rather obsolete these days, which is a shame as it's such a nice word for a simple concept: it's the day after tomorrow. edit: thank you, unknown overmorrow appreciator :)
Police Officers of Reddit, what are some of the bribes people have offered to get out of jail or a citation?	My dad's great uncle (my great-great uncle, then? right?) once bribed a black officer with a ten dollar bill to be used for fired chicken. He got many tickets.	I had a 18 or 19 year old girl offer me sex to get her out of a ticket, I had pulled her over to tell her, her brake light was out and wasn't gonna give her a ticket. I walked up to the window and said something along the lines of "do you know why I pulled you over". She started crying and babbling for about 2-3 minutes in that time she offered to have sex with me to get her out of the ticket. I calmly said mam' calm down, I just wanted you to know your brake lights out and I walked away like a boss.
What is the most unbelievable thing that a stranger has done to you?	I was leaving a bar/lounge after my buddy's birthday thing. Some dude standing on the wall (seems a little intoxicated) calls me over to him and says that I look just like his son who passed away. Naturally, I said "sorry to hear that man". This guy started grabbing my arms and shoulders and started rubbing my face so I pushed him off. He grabs me again and starts leaning in to kiss me, so I knocked him out cold.	When I was about 10, I went to an EB games in the mall to buy Diablo II Battle Chest. As the cashier was ringing me out, he asked "Do you have a guardian with you?", as I hesitantly looked around the store trying to think of a response. All of a sudden I hear "Yes, I'm his grandmother" from a little old woman behind me. He cleared me and I was good to go. Minor, but I always think of how cool that was of her!
[Serious] What's the cruelest thing that's ever been said to you?	"You're not wife material and I know you like me more than I like you so I have all the power and I'm bored now, and I got you all of those gifts a week ago because that's what boyfriends do and it doesn't really matter. I would have broken up with you a month ago but I didn't want to dump you right before your birthday and I wanted to keep having sex with you," Best part? My maman told me not to trust a fucking Pole. Should've listened.	"I understand why your father abandoned you." two months after my dad kicked me out, said by my evil, manipulative, cheating ex when I told him I didn't want to be with him anymore after I found out he had bought another girl lingerie.
What was that one thing that made you say "fuck this, I'm leaving this fucking job this instant" ?	Started a new job at a clothing store (the one with the pony and polos) when I was straight out of high school. Anyways, its my first day on the sales floor, after folding shirts and then having people walk by and ruin the shirts I just folded all day long I thought to myself, do I REALLY want to fold shirts all day? Ended up finishing my shift, the next day I called and said something along the lines of 'I am never coming in to work again'	Getting locked IN the glass lobby area at work, when there was a active shooter alert in the area. They locked down the electronic doors and I was trapped out there under the reception desk. Could not get in the main office area or leave because of locked down doors for 45 minutes. When we got off lock down, my boss made the comment, "well there is always some collateral damage." Started looking for new job the next hour.
[NSFW] What historical event should never be turned into a porno?	The Prophet Mohammed and His Favorite Wife, Aisha. Because it would be a fucking child porn. Because Mohammed was a pedophile.	Cold war. Everyone is looking at each other with extreme hard-ons with accidental touches in between and nothing ever happens.
Roommates of reddit, what are some mildly annoying things that your roommate does that drive you insane?	She stopped cleaning after I started dating my boyfriend. I do the dishes, she does everything else. I know there are some limits but she hasn't cleaned in a few months. I have to call her out in order to get her to clean. Somedays i just do it on my own because I'm tired of fussing.	Asking me to buy stuff for our shared bathroom but never offering to share the money for it. And yet as soon as she brings back a few toilet rolls, hey girl it's gonna be 8 bucks.
Most planes have in flight wifi. Why are black box recordings not uploaded/backed up to a server for easier recovery and investigation?	Well, maybe not via WiFi. But using some other form of long distance communication might work. Actually, I think that's a pretty clever idea.	The point of a black box is that it cannot be compromised! If you hook it up to in-flight then it opens up the risk of tampering.
What's the longest book you've ever read front to back?	King James bible. It's basically the super extended version of the new revisions. While it had it's moments, after finishing it i was more sure God didn't exist. What a load of shit.	Crime and Punishment. After I finished it, I read a bunch of discussions on it and realized that I apparently missed the entire point. I mainly just read Star Wars books now.
What's your "fuck, not again" story?	Every time I see Donald Trump's face or hear his voice. Or see his name. Or walk by one of his tacky, gold lamé buildings. Whenever I think of him at all. Like now, in fact. Goddamnit.	I'm a fairly heavy sleeper, so for a long time I've had a loud alarm clock placed across the room so that when it goes off I'm fully awake due to the time it takes to get up, walk across the floor and turn the thing off. Recently however my body decided it wasn't going to let me get in the way of sleep that easily, so now whenever its been going off I'll unconsciously get up, walk across my bedroom, tear the clock out from its socket and then drag it back into bed with me. I've woken up snuggling my alarm clock enough that I now have to place multiple alarms around the room in order to make sure I don't just spoon my household appliances.
reddit, what don't you have sympathy for?	Soldiers. I don't care that you got your legs blown off or whatever, you chose to enlist in the military and put your body and mind in danger to serve the interests of TNCs and government pockets.	People who create crowd-funding campaigns for their personal expenditure (vacations, electronics, etc). If you can afford it, do it. Don't guilt your friends, family and the internet into paying for your luxuries
How come when applying for a job online, you have to type in all your damn work experience when the first thing you did was upload your resume? Why the fuck don't they just read the resume!?	decent jobs get a lot of applications. this weeds out people who are just surfing around for jobs, leaves in the people who care	I fucking HATE the taleo.net interface. I have applied for jobs at multiple companies that use that fucking thing, and every time I have to fill out the same damn form with the same information.
Security personnel of Reddit, how much elevator sex, booger picking and wacky dancing do you see on your monitors?	Zero. Anyone that tells you security personnel just sit around watch cameras is full of shit. Elevators are always on but having been a dispatcher in a major casino for twelve years trust me no one is watching unless an alarm goes off. Same for everywhere else.	IT security here. I'm not looking for your porn and I'm not in charge of monitoring network traffic yet I've still run into it several times. Once a guy actually encrypted it. Unfortunately, when we tried to migrate his data it caused an error "cannot copy file celebname_blowjob.jpg". He encrypted it with our goddamn keys! I would have decrypted it but I don't share his taste in porn. This was on a government computer.
What is most addictive game you ever played?	Detroit become human I have poured my life into it since it was released like four days ago, I’ve finished it two times and am on my third playthrough, help me	The most addictive game I played _was_ World of Warcraft. Back when I was still playing it, I would get up in the morning, log in and not do anything other than play WoW the entire day. During summer break, I'd even turn my alarm on to 6am, so I had more time to play. It was insane, that game was basically my life for the better part of 3 years that felt like 10. I kind of miss being able to get so absorbed by a game in that way, but I am also not 18 anymore and don't have the time to spend so much time on one single game.
What was the one moment where you thought "God, this has to be the trashiest thing I've ever done"?	I was in Spain earlier this year. It was about three in the afternoon and some friends and I were sitting on the patio of a restaurant overlooking the street. We were all on our way to being quite drunk when a large group of beautiful British boys walk by. They start talking to us and tell us how they are trying to get photos of boobs for their friend back home who couldn't come with them. I was refusing at first but after they started singing "Show us your tits! Show your tits for the lads." in those lovely accents I had to give in. There were families walking by and I was the only one of my friends to do it. Now theres a picture of me flashing the camera floating around England.	getting smashed on homemade beer in the day, in public, sitting on a broken folding chair I found in woods behind my house, barbecuing a rabbit my dog killed on the oven rack over a fire pit in the yard of my friend's squat, burning trash and imploring passing motorists to honk. I later "seduced" one of the biggest regrets of my life in an RV. We were not the only people in that RV, and that RV smelled. tl;dr we broke the bed
What have you been permanently banned from for life and why?	Me, along with other top members of a Michael Jackson fanboard, revolting against its tyrannical and autistic admins who had gone power hungry. We went down burning and by being banned pretty much destroyed the forum. Edgy, ain't it?	I have a friend who got banned from a bar because he kept climbing a brick wall inside. He was doing it all night, many photos were taken, and he was eventually told he was not welcome back. For about a month following this he would then photoshop something hilarious onto a photo of him climbing the wall and post it on the bar's facebook page. This has made them very irate and they have reminded him numerous times not to return to the bar. He's probably been back about ten times and no one has noticed.
Redditors who are browsing new, thank you and why?	I sometimes browse new on funny and gaming so I can downvote 90&#37; of the posts because they are facebook tier garbage.	Because my vote means more. My comment means more and I have the chance to get in early on something that may be huge.
Barbers/Hairdressers of Reddit: how exactly do you want customers to communicate what they want to you? What do they say/do that is unhelpful?	As a transgender, when i was transitionning. I had difficulties asking for a girl gendered haircut while i was still a man. How to ask for this. And how tolerant usually are hairdressers about this?	I get my hair cut by an old eastern European man named Boris. I walk in, sit down, say hello, he asks me how do you want your hair, short? I say, yes, short. Tapered back or square? Tapered please. Okay. We say nothing more to one another and my hair is perfect fifteen minutes later. I love my barber.
What have you never told your best friend because you're afraid it may end the friendship?	That I think her Republican politics are pretty abhorrent and I can't believe someone that intelligent has such backward views on basic things that could make her and others' lives better.	I never told my friend that I know that her and her boyfriend used to steal food from my house. Her boyfriend at the time basically stole from everyone and was always getting fired from work for stealing from the till. The bit that upsets me is that she knew full well that if she needed food, I'd have given it to her. She didn't need to steal the stuff. She ditched that boyfriend which is why we're still friends. (And she doesn't steal from me anymore.)
Big girls of Reddit, how do men treat you?	I'm sorry that they treat you that way. I've never treated anyone that way, especially not because of their appearance. Anyone who does that is a jackass who doesn't deserve you.	I'm a big woman. Have been large since I was eight. I always thought *if* could find someone who would be willing to marry me, it would be a 'settling' situation and not love. I was wrong. My husband and I will be celebrating 16 years next month. I love him more everyday and he feels the same. Just be you. That's all I can offer to you. Just be yourself.
[Serious] Women of reddit who were incarcerated-What is your take on Orange is the New Black?	just so everyone knows orange is the new black is based on a real llife event and piper chapman is a real character based off a real girl with the same first name and a different last name, i think it was kerman or something like that, so most of the things that happen in the show have been isnpred by real events.	I have worked with many female offenders coming out of jail. I've heard this question asked a few times. Most of them love the show, and actually say it is pretty accurate. However, it seems to be common sentiment that the main character (who i believe is white, I haven't watched the show) is the most unrealistic part of the show. I've heard them say she doesn't represent the common incarcerated woman and it's difficult to identify with her. This of course is a highly diverse county, with lots of racial diversity. So maybe opinions differ elsewhere.
What is your “Oh shit, I’m an asshole.” moment?	I mocked this annoying autistic kid’s lisp to his face because he kept bothering me. Am I an asshole? Yes. Do I regret it? Not really.	When I spent a day with my parents and siblings, all of whom were bugging me intensely, then realized I am like them.
When did you realise you're actually a pretty good person?	After the fourth time I donated one of my kidneys to orphan children I started to wonder if I might be good.	When I started spending time around people that weren’t good and found myself confused about how they could make decisions that were so obviously wrong or selfish and not be wracked with guilt. Watching them be callous towards other people and not care. I couldn’t understand how or why they chose to behave that way.
[serious] Any tips for someone who is about to become homeless?	how are you doing, OP? it's been a few hours. when you say imminent, is it like... within a day, a week, or a month?	Get a library card. Look up all the resources your city may offer. try to find smaller shelters, the large city-funded ones are usually really overcrowded and terrifying if you're new to the system. Make sure you have an ID and social security card (shelters can assist with this if you're totally broke). Set up a temp address at a shelter for mail. Most cities offer emergency food stamps or cash assistance if you havent already applied (90 days typically). Find mom and pop restaurants, most are willing to trade doing dishes or cleaning for a meal. Lastly, do you have family anywhere that can take you in? If homelessness is inevitable, hitch a ride to a place with a temperate climate so you dont die in the winter.
Girls of Reddit, what are the cringiest things guys do?	The thing that gets to me the most is when I am talking to some new guy, like after work or class or something, and mid conversation I see them blatantly scan me over. Then sometimes his pupils will get bigger and it is like he is not even paying attention to what I am saying. Excuse me sir, I am not comfortable with you fucking me in your head while I am trying to ask you what we missed in class yesterday. Edit: Maybe I am not great at getting my point across, or describing the situation. I just don't like it when a guy I barely know is checking me out instead of listening to what I am saying, if we happen to be having a conversation. If you find me attractive, that's fine, but at least listen to me because I am a PERSON.	The day after a second date I got a MASSIVE text which was a very very poorly disguised 'oops wrong number' fake text. It started out "Oh hey Matt I missed your call, blah blah blah something something something, then went: 'by the way, I met this amazing girl...' and went into extreme detail about how wonderful I was (I'd spent about 5 hours total in his company in my life) and how he couldn't tell me because he 'didn't speak girl' and maybe next time he should hold my hand because I might like that? He was 25. I almost threw my phone across the room out of cringe. To this day I haven't read the whole text, it was too painful.
What do you miss about being in Highschool?	Not a goddamn thing. Highschool sucked. Now I'm an adult and turned out better than the people who made my life hell so I win.	I miss that no matter where I went, there was always a friend within a 3 minute walk of me
Strip club workers of reddit, what is your best/worst story from the job?	This isn't strictly an answer to the question, but I went to a strip club with my friend a couple of weeks ago, and it's a little sad how anti-man they are. This one had loads of signs up telling men not to touch, and if a man got too close he'd get yelled at and verbally abused, etc. But my friend (bisexual female) started flirting with one of the strippers, and before long they were making out and everything. It's a bit of a double-standard - women are allowed to touch other women, but men aren't.	walked into the kitchen and saw one of the girls sitting bottomless on a prep counter never, ever eat at a strip club
People who act less intelligent than you really are, why?	Built this dumb persona up for my self took sometime but when I say something smart people compliment me and tell me what's wrong with me saying smart things	Life is easier if people think you're stupid. No one expects as much. At my last 2 jobs I didn't play dumb, I was overworked, everything was pawned off on me constantly. This job I play dumb, I get to do just my job and nothing else. I go home with no stress.
what is a story you have been dying to tell?	So I'm in high school and at my school, there's about 5 black kids. 2 of the kids, Daymian and Koby (like THE Kobe) are brothers and play on the basketball team. Anyway, there's another black guy at my school who looks like Koby (but doesn't know the real Koby or Daymian). One day it just so happened that Koby and his look-alike wore a similar red hoodie. During a passing period, Dayman walked up behind who he thought was his brother and said "What up, Koby?" to which the Koby look-alike turn around, clearly a little angry, and rubuttled "Oh hey, LEBRON!"	I drove a commercial submarine when I was thirteen. There were almost a hundred tourists on board. At that time I had never even driven a car. One of my proudest achievements. Never relevant in conversation.
Actors of Reddit: What are your stories of theatre productions gone horribly wrong?	I once said MacBeth backstage. 20 people died and the half audience was blinded while the other half literally lost control of their bowels	Diary of Anne Frank... Small production so we used random stuff for sound effects, one of which was a kids toy that had a siren sound. It's the last scene, the Nazis are coming to take away the Frank family, but instead of a dramatic siren in the distance the stagehand missed the button on the toy and sounded "Blue square! Good job!"
You have an unlimited budget to fuck with the heads of future archeologists. What will you do?	What kind of sick fantasies do you people have? Future archeologists are kids now. You want to fuck them, but to make it even more fucked up, you want to fuck their severed head? Jesus christ..	Pay everyone to start using a date 1000 years in the future and never say anything about it. Future humans will wonder what happened during a 1000 year dark period where there are no written or digital records and technology stagnated.
What movie was BETTER than the book it was based off?	Lord of the Rings although I haven't read past the first three pages. That book was way too dense for me to read.	Mean Girls. It's based on a non-fiction book called "Queen Bees and Wannabes" that's kind of a mom's guide to teen girls. The book was fine (I don't have a teen so maybe it's better if you do), but the movie does an amazing job of turning a non-fiction book into a story--it incorporates a lot of the psychological observations of the book into a narrative. Really impressive screenwriting.
If you had a time machine where would you go?	I would try to disrupt the events that led to the 9/11 attacks. The world hasn't yet recovered from the aftermath of that terrible day.	Would I still be 22 year old me or can I time travel back to carefree days when I was a little kid and actually be and feel like a little kid? Because that's what I would do. I'd go back to when I was 5, playing at my grandparent's cottage home with my brother and our cousins in the summer..
Reddit, what made you "nope the fuck" out of your date?	She fessed up to being a trump voter which was kinda shocking considering she was in a doctoral program. A college educated mellineal white woman who voted for trump. I nooped.	Well, she asked if she could smoke inside. I don't really like cigarettes, but I didn't want to make a big deal of it on the first date, so I told her I'd open a window and that it should be okay. Didn't realize she was talking about smoking meth.
SUBWAY workers of reddit what's the weirdest sandwich you have made ?	I get funny looks from the staff at subway when I ask for BOTH tomato AND cucumber, like i'm the first person to ever think about combining the two. It didn't bother me the first time since the staff member could have just had 'that' face or the expression was from something else. Its happened twice since then at different subways but they also asked me to confirm, like somehow they had misheard me. TLDR Food Tip: Mix tomato and cucumber, they work.	I had a girl order a order a sandwich with "all the olives." I was the kind of sandwich artist who didn't give a shit about corporate policy regarding "two ounces of lettuce, 3 pickles, etc." I was the people's sandwich artist. So I laid nearly a container of olives down. Must have been two pounds of olives on that shitty six inch. She loved it.
Redditors who speak a language besides English, what are some of the cheesy rhymes like "see you later alligator" or "Stan the man" in your language?	In Swedish: Tja kexet, står du här och smular? In english: hey there biscuit, are standing here and crumb-ing/crumbling? It just doesn't make sense in either language, but it's suppose to be a pickup-line.	"Hasta luego, cara huevo" means see you later, egg face in Spanish. Edit: people in the comments saying that they're pretty sure that it's "cara de huevo", it can be, but as it is a colloquialism, you don't really say it like that. Like in "cara culo".
What's your most NSFW family moment?	My brother forced himself on me. I won't elaborate further. Added for further clarification: I'm not making any of this up. I mention I won't elaborate simply because if I posted without it, someone would've asked about it anyway. That being said, I'm sorry a bunch of you are really butthurt about my decision to keep the details to myself. Added again: I'd like to thank all the people who've messaged me with kind words. Thanks for being good people. Last addition: I just want to express how shocking and disgusted I am by some of the responses I continue to get. I hope some of these people find some humanity in their lives because they sure as hell don't have it today.	My uncle cheated on my aunt with her brother's wife for a while about 17/18 years ago. Nobody outside of those 4 people know except me and my eldest cousin because my aunt got drunk one family reunion and told us. Everyone thinks the 2 families just hate eachother for some petty reason. What makes it worse is my aunt has a child who is turning 18 who looks nothing like his dad but strikingly similar to my other uncle. Yet nobody has ever mentioned anything and we have never brought it up. TL;DR My cousin might be my cousin!
When I was 20, my girlfriend and I chaperoned my sister's 5th grade field trip. I thought it was a dinosaur field trip, but it turned out to be a sex ed field trip. What's your best "this is not what I thought it was going to be" story?	My I was entering college, I was expecting it to be a huge party with a ton of hot girls and parties and stuff. Some of that was exposed to me while I was in high school. But once I finally started college as an engineering major, life was drastically different from what I expected. Engineering classes have virtually zero girls. And if there are any, most of the time they are the type you wouldn't want to fuck. Definitely what I wasn't expecting. I thought it would get better after college, but no. I'm still surrounded by smart, nerdy men all day every day. Tears. :(	English was my Korean roommate's third language my freshman year of college. He thought he had registered for 'finger painting' for the spring semester. I remember him leaving for class that morning bragging about how easy the semester was going to be because he was going to go do pre school level art. He came back visibly flustered. Turned out he had signed up for 'figure drawing' which focused on drawing the human body. "there was naked dudes. naked dudes."
What is the stupidest thing that has come out of your mouth that you're willing to admit to?	In my defense I was very sleep deprived. I was telling a colleague about some piece of school artwork done by my little cousin, and declared that he's going to be the next Leonardo Di Capricorn. When asked who I meant by this, I clarified: "You know, the guy who cut off his ear."	A guy got in the elevator pushing a double stroller. In one half of the stroller was the tiniest little newborn baby I've ever seen in my life. The other half was covered with a baby blanket. I wondered if he had newborn twins, or if he had one newborn and one toddler. Unfortunately, what came out of my mouth was "Are they both the same kind?"
30+ y/o people of reddit, if you could re-live your 20s, what would you have done differently?	I wouldn't have married her is my first thought. Then I think, I wouldn't have my kiddos then, and I love them. I don't know, get a better job when I was younger, then work up to my position that I have now sooner. Edit: I turn thirty next week.	I would have kept a diary. Human memory is associative, and age really fucks with your head. There's a lot of great stuff I've lived through that I can only remember randomly, when something similar to it comes up. If I'd kept a diary I would be able to just go back and read what the fuck happened.
What is that one ingredient that ruins every dish for you?	Jalapeno peppers. I don't mind hot and spicy food. I like Indian food. But when I've delved into Mexican/US food - which is slightly niche here in the UK, although expanding in popularity - the chili peppers just smother everything else. At least to my palate. And I don't mind a bit of the old Madras curry!	Don't tell me I can't taste the cauliflower you "hid" in my mac and cheese. I can fucking taste it, you devious prick.
Reddit, what's your very best life advice?	Happiness can't be found or given. Happiness is a choice you make. Choose to be happy and you will be happy.	Be nice, but avoid letting others take advantage of you. Figure out what's important to you, and prioritize your life accordingly. Value good friends and keep them close. Learn something new everyday. Keep secrets, but don't expect anyone to keep yours. Live beneath your means. Start saving while you're young. Read books. Don't smoke. Exercise and stay active. Learn to see things from other people's perspective. Know that things you believe true today, may be proven false tomorrow. Be open to that change.
People who refuse to be organ donors, why do you do it?	My mother-in-law was an ER nurse for many years, and she told me that doctors just don't work as hard to save someone if they know they're an organ donor. Thus, I'm not an organ donor. People that say "I doubt doctors would do X, Y and Z" fail to take into account that doctors are people each with a different disposition. You might get a doctor that will save you at all costs, you might get one that thinks your organs might be put to better use in someone else.	Because I'm a leukemia survivor and born in Germany during mad cow scare. No one wants my shit. I've tried.
What's the most ironic death?	ITT: No one who knows what "Ironic" means. The only ironic death would be someone who dies while trying to do something to specifically keep themselves from dying. "If I drink this mysterious liquid, it'll purge my body of all the toxins and make me live longer" and then immediately succumbing to organ failure and internal bleeding and death.	Probably Jerome Moody, he drowned during a party for New Orleans lifeguards. There were around 100 professional lifeguards at the party, and four lifeguards were actually on duty at the time. Now here's where it gets good, they were hosting a party to celebrate New Orleans Recreational Department’s first nondrowning season in recorded history.
You win the lottery... what's the first frivolous thing you buy?	A super-luxury McMansion in Maryland that I'll use for weekend-visits only, someplace near my ex-wife, just to witness the pissed off look on her face when she sees the women that I'm bedding! Cheated on me then dropped the divorce on me while I was gone, eh? Oh, sweet vengeance, carry me on your shoulders!	A retired aircraft carrier which i'll sail the world putting on various comedy and music festivals with parties in international waters
Should I mention my disability in my dating profile, or wait until later to mention it?	I would go with C because A and B are way too revealing and suspicious. Just mentioning disability will make a potential partner run for the hills. Before when I was ignorant, I thought people with disabilities were not independent enough for a life of their own. When I get to know a person, which is important, the disability doesn't matter. When it comes to disabilites, inexperienced people tend to think negatively and don't bother giving that person a chance. Even though it seems deceitful, it really isn't because you are being yourself and you are not defined as "the blind girl" or "the girl who can't walk". You need to show these people that being disabled doesn't define who you are.	You need to mention that you are disabled. People are shallow. You will miss a few people by not mentioning your disabilities. Also, by mentioning them you may attract some people. Whether you want to attract those people is something else.
What is the weirdest dream you've had?	If I'm dreaming right now and when I make up and check reddit. I'll read this comment I made and that would be the weirdest dream	I went cliff diving and ended up hitting a rock on my way down, but instead of blood, silly string sprayed out and a bunch of people gathered around my dying body to have a dance party.
What is your best childhood memory?	It was during a test I had when I was fifteen: The answers were four B's in a row. I found it strange as it seemed like the questions were built around for this answer only. I had little time left as class was about to end, so I went with my gut and kept the four B's. I later discovered I had failed the test. I made a complaint and asked my professor about it. Her response was: "It was a fucking essay question. Not a multiple choice. Holy shit, I can see why you failed middle school and your father and I have to homeschool you." Lesson learned.	I got an award for being compassionate in my class. It was actually just a blank piece of paper that said compassionate on it and my name. But for some reason it made me really happy
Religious folks of Reddit, what is a commonly misunderstood aspect of your religion?	That Judaism has anything at all to do with Christianity or gives a darn about the concepts of Hell, the Devil, or Jesus. And get right out of my face with that "Judeo-Christian" schtick. Edit: Guess I pissed off some Messianics or something. Good riddance.	I'm Christian, but even I don't like the bible thumping people on the side of the road who say you're going to hell for this or that. Every religion has their fanatics/extremists, that doesn't make the whole religion like that.
A new sitcom stars Reddit, 4Chan and Tumblr as roommates. What is the plot of one of the episodes?	Well, reddit isn't funny and is universally hated by anybody with a sense of humor. Tumblr is the hot chick. 4chan is the off the wall Kramer type character, except way more insane. The plot is that the show isn't funny and gets cancelled immediately.	The three mains run into older versions of themselves, a haggard looking Digg, SomethingAwful and Livejournal. Reality is a harsh mirror.
What is your signature quirk when you are drunk?	I'm usually a very introverted person, and tend to only speak with people that I'm close to, but if I'm at a party and I've been drinking, I am talking to everybody! And I get really silly.	Ever since I was young when I got really sick I would always take a shower. It helps me feel better. Well my first time getting blackout drunk I realized my body essentially thinks, "Oh my god she's sick we have to get her in a shower!!!" So, if I get too drunk I wake up in a shower....
Reddit, one of my old coworkers never drank water because "water makes you rust." Who's the biggest idiot you know?	My sister has always been kind of oblivious. For example, I convinced her (at the age of 16) that a Dill Pickle was not a pickled cucumber, but a pickle plant that had been "dilled." Also, a "dill" is the herb used for dilling.	A secretary at my last job quit because of one of those religious doomsday predictions. When doomsday didn't happen she asked for her job back and they told her she'd already been replaced.
When I worked in a grocery store, I waited about two years for someone to ask me where my honey was so I could reply "She's at home" with a straight face. What jokes are you saving for the right occasion?	I was playing a game with my friend when I notice someone on the other team has a high ping so I say to my friend "Hey I think this guy might be asain" "What makes you think that?" he says "Cause his ping" to which my friend promptly replys "Thats racist man just cause hes asain doesn't mean hes called ping"	I always wear a winter coat early on in the winter, like mid-October yesterday somebody said "Aren't you hot in that?" to which I just replied "thanks."
Redditors who have found a dead body, what is your story?	One summer a long time ago, me and some buddies from school heard about this kid that was killed in the woods. Out of some morbid curiosity, we set out to find the body, but were met with constant setback after setback. Some of the older guys were trying to beat us there too, because they heard about some reward money for finding the kid. Well after a couple days of hiking and camping and the usual mischief that boys get into, we chanced upon the body, laying near the railroad tracks. We were all in disbelief. Not only that we actually *found* the kid, but that we seemed to have grown up so fast in the process. I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?	When I was 12, I was at my best friend's house for a sleepover. We were on the computer while his dad was working in the office. All of a sudden we hear him sounding like he's trying to sneeze, but it took over a full minute before the full release. A few minutes later, his sister came downstairs to talk to their dad. Turns out he had a heart attack and I listened to him die. The sleepover was cancelled after that.
What is something schools should NOT teach, but do?	Math beyond a certain point. I excelled in everything except math all through school. Core requirements in general piss me off.	That Wikipedia is the devil. Wikipedia is a great place to start for any research. Most public school textbooks are less up to date.
What random fact makes you the most uncomfortable?	That right now as you are browsing dank meme on Reddit someone somewhere is being tortured, or starving to death, or going through their own version of hell. Just because we don't see it doesn't mean it's not happening.	My son, who is currently 15, is now older than I was when I was living on the street/in cars/couch-surfing. I can't even fathom my son, who I feel is a lot smarter than I ever was, having to spend a single night trying to find a place to sleep and being unable to ask his parents. Seeing him at this age makes the tenuous relationship I've since reformed with my parents much more difficult to justify at present. I just keep thinking, how the fuck did they not give half a shit about where I was or how I was surviving? I'd cut my own fucking arm off to keep my own kids safe.
[Serious] Sociopaths of reddit, what made you realise that you are one? did you try to change anything?	When my girlfriend was bawling her eyes out in front of me and I wasn't affected in the slightest. The only emotion I have is varying degrees of anger. I'm never not angry, I'm only less angry then other times. And I don't try to change it because there's nothing to change. I am who I am.	I was diagnosed with ASPD, I have almost all the markers. I've always known I was different but I didn't have a word for it. I don't consider it a sickness, infact there are no drawbacks. I never tried to change but with that said I'm not being myself around other people. Social interactions are just a game that I happen to be very good at.
What was the biggest plot twist in your life?	This just happened. See I knew all my life I am Native Canadian, but I was always told I was mixed with French and Irish. I have a French surname for god's sake. So we did one of those DNA kits. It came back and says I am 70% Native Canadian. Not surprising. Turns out im a 25% English rose! I'm like 3 percent French and 1 percent Irish. It makes sense as I have always been interested in England. My Native Canadian sixth sense always knew i had a little Gloucestershire going on.	Just imagine for a moment shall we: worked in mental health for 5 years, studied to become a mental health therapist, got my license to practice therapy, always knew I was a little "off", but then BOOM! I have a psychotic episode and discover I'm bipolar type 1. Cheers.
What is the most NSFW moment you had with a complete stranger?	I was standing in a local completely packed bus. And I was standing in the completely packed aisle and a hot girl was standing right in front of me. Now everytime there's a pothole in a road or a bump, my penis would touch her ass again and again and I got an erection. I don't think she noticed, but it was awkward...	I was at a crowded bar (packed wall-to-wall), and went to get drinks for my girlfriend and myself. I picked up two pints at the bar, and as I was making my way back through the crowd, a girl cuts in front of me. Apparently she thought her boyfriend was behind her, because she reaches back and starts just fondling my junk. I can't put either drink down, so I have to try to yell in this girl's ear, but the bar is so loud that she can't hear me. It's so packed that I can't pull away, so she proceeds to give me an over-the-pants-handy until we finally get a little farther from the bar and she can actually hear me yelling "PLEASE STOP GRABBING MY DICK."
Is it wrong or selfish to ask my boyfriend to cut down/ stop smoking weed?	Why does he need to cut down or stop smoking all together just because you don't like the smell? I think a more reasonable solution would be asking him to smoke it away from you. Plus, I'm guessing you went into the relationship knowing he smokes weed.	Asking him to be sensitive to your needs isn't really selfish, don't ask him to straight up stop, but asking him to go outside to smoke isn't a horrible thing. Simply say "Hey, [bf] I'm really sensitive to the smell of weed and if you could go outside to smoke it when I'm around then that would be a big relief for me. I'm not against you smoking weed, the smell just bothers me, thanks!"
What were you irrationally afraid of as a child?	For years I was afraid to go to a doctor or a hospital for a checkup because I remembered being circumcised when I was 4.	Pens. I thought that if I got ink on myself, it would stay there for life, enter my bloodstream, and slowly kill me. I fucking love pens now.
What quote has actually stuck with you and changed your life?	“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.”	It is difficult to forget pain, but more difficult to remember happiness for we have no scar to show for joy. I might have messed up the wording, it's been a while since I saw the original.
What are signs you don't love a person anymore?	Not sure if it quite fits but it is fresh in mind. An example from own of my good friends. Backstory: He is graduating from Uni and is looking for a place of his own. He has been dating this girl for 2 years. Me: Hey Buddy, I heard you and your girlfriend are looking for a new place, I found some for you at ****, ****, and ****. Friend: Hey thanks man! Those are really nice but the rent is kinda too steep for 1 person. Me: Don’t you mean two? Friend: No, myself.	It’s important to realize the difference between not loving someone anymore and just being around them *too* much. I thought I didn’t love my current girlfriend a while back and started hanging out with my friends more and the small breaks we took from each other, even for a night at a time, made me realize I couldn’t live without her and that I just needed to step back and get some perspective.
Tattoo artist of reddit, what is the worst you have ever screwed up a tattoo and what happen when it was noticed?	My artist does incredible work. Absolutely stunning stuff. But he does it while stoned off his ass and will have a smoke break every 1.5 hours. The worst he did was screw up one little line and then tried to blame it on me for moving when it was obvious it was him that fucked up	A family friend of mine is a tattoo artist. I remember when he was still doing it out of his garage. One of my Dads friends wanted a tattoo of the American flag with an eagle carrying it. He got the outline done on him, then started filling in the color for the Eagle. Which ended up being absolutely gorgeous. Then he started doing the colors for the flag. From the top he started with white. For those who don't know, the American flag starts with red strips and ends with red stripes, not white. Anyway, no one noticed for a long time. Then a few years later during a Super Bowl party at my parents house, someone noticed and told him.
[Serious] what are the biggest problems within our society?	Religion. We let it control to much of our society. The influence it brings to government decisions and laws (in some countries) is far too high. This is something that is purely a choice to believe in. (in most countries)	I'm always the good guy in every situation, in my own mind, and anyone who doesn't agree with me is the bad guy. It's a problem because everyone thinks like this on some level. Nobody wants to admit to Being evil, and they justify that by demonizing any adversary.
What's the worst thing you can learn from porn?	That women know how to suck dick. That men like to eat pussy. That women are always clean when you fuck them in the ass. That men know what the fuck they are doing in the bedroom. and the worst offender, That all black dudes have huge cocks. None of the above are correct or factual by any stretch of the imagination.	That all women go from rational human beings to insatiable whores when they see a cock. MILF: No Johnny, you're my son's friend and I'm married... (Johnny whips out his cock) Nevermind! Gobble, gobble, gobble.
What is the craziest thing a coworker of yours has done and kept their job?	this one asshole just goes on reddit for like the entire fucking workday. get off reddit John, I swear to god	My supervisor at a gas station sold cigarettes to a 17 year old in a sting, was given a written arrest on the spot, got to keep his job and was later promoted to manager. A few months later I sold beer to a 27 year old in a company sting to see if I ID'd people who looked 35 or younger and I was fired. Fuck you, BP. Edit: Holy shit, thought for sure this would get buried like every other comment I've ever submitted to AskReddit. I guess I got a good story out that experience.
If you could have a real-life throwaway, what would you do?	I'd dress up like a Samurai and challenge random pedestrians to a duel. Or I'd tell that girl I like how much I hate being friendzoned and how perfect we are for each other.	Ask other people about me. Hey do you like K&F9, like like him? Is he annoying? yada yada. That or murder.
what's the wittiest thing you've ever said?	Programming background... A friend of mine was making fun of me. Friend: I will write an API and It will have one function which will have Your asshole as an argument/parameter(meaning your asshole will be taking things) Me:The Second argument of this function will have your mouth in it. Friend: Crash.exe In programming context it is possible....	When I was a kid, I was talking to a woman I hadn't seen in a few years. Her: You must have grown a foot since I last saw you. Me: I'm pretty sure I've always had two.
Which is the worst pick-up line you've ever used that actually worked?	Just follow the 2 absolute rules of picking up girls and any pickup line, no matter the quality, will work 1. Be attractive. 2. Don't not be attractive. ಠ_ಠ	Her: I love your beard. I wish I could grow a beard like that. Me: I know of a way we can share for a while.
What is your most embarrassing moment of sending message to the wrong contact?	I took a screenshot of a girl I was texting who was telling me she wants to spend more time with me because of how funny I was (or something to that effect) and I thought I sent it to my best friend with the fire emojis right after it. I only noticed I didn't send it to him two or three hours later and that involved desperate scrambling because I was taking a poop when I noticed my mistake. I don't take screenshots of texts anymore.	I'm talking to a guy at the moment who's trying to work his way in if you know what I mean... He sent me a Whatsapp last night of him smiling in bed, I screenshotted it and sent it to my friend with the caption - Getting into yo DMMMMMMMSSSS GUUUUURL But ended up sending it back to him instead. We both had a laugh about it, and now i'm dying inside at the memory.
[Serious]Men and boys who have been raped, sexually harassed, or physically abused by women and girls what was your story?	I blacked out one of the first nights of my freshman year in college. My friends came into my room to check on me and this hippie-lookin' chick was just on top doin' her thing. No one really takes it too seriously, but it's always a fun story to recount for a laugh or two.	I was boozing hard, ended up taking some Xanax and passing out in my own bed. Woke up to this girl who I knew wanted me even though I have a serious girlfriend (she was in my house because she is friends with my roommates) on top of me, naked and riding me. I came to, pushed her off and said what the fuck?! She started crying, saying that she just wanted to be with me, and that she thought if I woke up to her fucking my passed out body I would want to keep going. Fucked up, but flip the situation around and I would be in prison right now. Edit: To answer most of your questions: I'm fine, but no I didn't do anything about it. To make things worse she was sober.
Those who have found themselves mentioned in Craigslist "Missed Connections" section and gone through with trying to contact/meet the other party, how did it go?	This is the kind of thing where you wake up in the morning with Tom Hanks face sitting you while you're tied to the bed	Not me, but my cousin saw a girl drop a wallet on the subway. He quickly got her attention and told her. She grabbed it and quickly ran away when the subway door opened. For whatever reason, he ended up checking missed connections and found her message saying that a cute guy saved her day when she dropped her wallet and she would love to meet up. He wrote what he looked like and what she was wearing to prove it was him. They ended up meeting, but the girl just wasn't his type at all, so they chatted a bit and left it at that.
What is the most fucked up thing someone told you as a child?	That Jesus Christ was tortured and murdered for MY sins. What a fucked up lie to tell in order to brainwash them into pledging 10% of their future income to be lied to on Sundays.	My grandma told us we couldn't play in the woods behind the park because a sex offender lived back there. If he caught us, he would shove an empty coke bottle in your vagina, open end first, and pull it out really fast. The suction would vacuum out your uterus and he saved all the filled bottles from other girls he found in his shack. My cousins and I were 7-11 yrs old. She also said around that same time that strippers were so turned on by giving lap dances that they would poop a little on their customers.
How sick do you have to be to take a day off?	You shouldn't be considering 'is this a sick day'. If you are, it isn't. Get your ass in to work. I've lost jobs by making the wrong decision then actually getting sick.	Rarely. Unless it's the soul sickness. You know, that mental sickness of not being anywhere near able to put up with a single grain of bullshit and you're a mouse's cut hair away from taking Tim's stupid Garfield mug, smashing it into his teeth, and watching him drown on blood, tooth, and porcelain. Then I don't go.
What is the easiest job that also pays well?	Developer in Silicon Valley. You don't need to be great or even good just show up get dozens of job offers daily and make an easy 100k	I make about 30 an hour once you average my night differentials and Sunday premium pays. I'm a mechanic for the postal service. Basically I baby sit the machines that sort your mail. It can be frustrating at times when you have to delv into schematics and troubleshoot but generally I just replace broken belts, seized bearings, and write down the numbers the machine is producing. Plus good health insurance, FERS, and a no lay off clause in our contract.
Has anyone here ever used Martial arts in a street fight or in self defense? If so what happened?	I pulled out my dick and came in the guys eye, blinding him before he could react. I then proceeded to suck the semen out of his iris and spit it down his asshole at a velocity that managed to pierce his colon	My buddy got in a bar fight one time. I was trained in taekwondo and Kung fu but never used them at the time. I got in the middle of the fight to try to break it up. I got punched in the head. This made me angry so I back-kicked the dude in the chest... Knocking him down. His friends helped him up and they left. Most of the people at the bar thought it was awesome but a few thought it was "low" of me to kick the dude when he was merely throwing punches.
military trainers/personnel of reddit: how does the prevalence of first person shooters/military video games effect new recruits?	My brother hasn't been very supportive of my plans to join the army, so I was joking one time and said, "Well, I always have the best score in Call of Duty!" he tried smacking me for that one. Then one day when I was going over the jobs I qualified for with my recruiter, he turns to the other guy and says, "Gonzalez, you're a so-and-so, right?" "Yeah. Okay so, have you ever played Call of Duty?" facepalmed so hard.	This is going off on a tangent, but I remember when I went to MEPS (where you go to make sure you are physically fit enough to join the military), there was a kid who was joining the Army. He was pretty overweight, and looked like the stereotypical guy who sat at home all day eating pizza poppers and playing video games (had some anime shirt on, didn't know it though). One of the guys who was watching us all while we waited to go through some tests asked him why he wanted to join the Army and he replied, "I just want to kill a lot of fucking bad guys and blow shit up!" Ten minutes later he was having a panic attack because he had to get his blood drawn and hated needles. TL/DR: Nerd kid imagines himself to be Master Chief, finds out arch nemesis is syringe.
What is your best example of "its a small world after all" ?	A couple of years ago I was on this sailing trip to different parts of the world. At our first destination there was this group of kids singing some song. It was kind of catchy, so I kept singing it to myself as we moved on to our next destination. When we got there a completely different group of kids were singing the same song but in a different language! It blew my mind! I even kept singing their song all the way to Splash Mountain. It truly was a small world.	I was born and raised in Berlin. I have... -run into a friend from high school while waiting for a bus in brooklyn -saw somebody from elementary school in the jungle in thailand -had a friend who went to school in japan with my childhood neighbor ...i know theres more but thats all i can think of off the top of my head EDIT: just remembered another weird one. My brother ran into one of his classmates from Berlin at the State Fair in North Carolina (both moms originally from there)
When I was in high school my mom couldn't afford to buy me a car, and I told her: "If you were a better mom, I'd have a car." To this day, I am ashamed of those words. Reddit, have you ever said anything to your parent(s) that you still regret today?	When I was in high school and wanted I car, I got a job and bought one. Sorry, I don't mean to be an ass there. I knew some guys in high school that said similar things. The fact that you now feel shame for saying this gives me the hope that those guys grow into entitled douche-nozzles. Clearly you grew past that attitude. Good work! * When I was 10 or 11 I mocked my Dad for being bald. I regret that. He was sensitive about it. * When I was a teenager my folks went away for a weekend and had some friends over. My grandparents called to make sure I was holding up. They overheard one of my friends obnoxiously asking if my grandparents were spying on me. I didn't say it, but I regret them hearing that obnoxious statement.	I remember calling my dad a dork once because of a joke he told, and it really hit him hard - his shoulders slumped immediately :(
15 years ago today, I was told that my mom had died. Watching her walk through the door was the greatest feeling I've ever had. What was your greatest feeling?	When I was a kid my dad would always get into a fights, ever since I was 5. Anyway, one day he got into a fight with the wrong dude and ended up getting shot in the face 8 times. I was told by the doctors he would not make it but deep down inside I knew he would. My mom didn't want me to see my dad because of how bad he was hurt. I later found out he was shot by none other than RICK JAMES. Yes, rick james shot my dad 8 times and he survived.	My first day after I finished Chemo. The entire world was brighter, colors were more vivid. I knew, intellectually, that nothing had changed, I was still suffering from side effects of chemo and I was only marginally more cured than the day before. The euphoria was just surreal, though. Everything was just more real, more happy, more good. On that note, the second best feeling was when I finally got to 5 years out with no evidence of disease. To be told that my odds of re-occurrence are virtually 0, that was a great day.
I am wasting my 20's in front of a computer screen, dreaming of the life I want to live. How do you motivate yourself to get out there and live your life?	Just. Fucking. Go. Do It. Want to hike? Go fucking hike tomorrow. Call some friends. Say hey. I'm going hiking today, you coming? Go get some coffee. See a cute girl there? Go talk to her. Yeesh.	Intense exercise every day. It doesn't have to be long. Just run sprints until you're out of breath and then walk until you're ready to run again. Do this for 15-30 minutes.
What feature/s do you think today's smartphones are missing?	The anti loud mouth fat bitch toggle: When at work and a 300lb amazon talks really loud to get the attention of their manager and disrupts the whole team then you push this button. Note- the worst form of fat bitch is the loud mouth fat bitch.	Manual Focus. please please please. I hate when i try to take a picture of something close up on my hand and the autofocus tries really hard, the image comes in crystal clears then the phone just decides that it wasn't in focus and stays blurry. *tap screen* focuses for a split second perfectly then goes blurry. sigh.
What would Ferris Bueller do in 2015?	There wouldn't be a Ferris because Ferris was just a figment of Cameron's imagination, like Tyler Durden in Fight Club. Cameron would be on really powerful anti-psychotic drugs in 2015, so his whole day would be staring at math problems in school. It would be mentally impossible for him to conjure up Ferris, let alone consider his unrequited desire for Sloane.	As soon as he hacks into his schools intranet, the breach is detected. An FBI cybersecurity task force traces the source to his house where he is promptly arrested, tried as an adult, convicted, and spends several years in prison.
What are you good at and what is the most helpful 'trick of the trade' that goes along with it?	*Call of duty.* Play with a team Its not lag you need to shoot the torso neck and head and don't miss. You only hate the game now because you expect a killstreak every game and its unreasonable for 12 players In a game to get 10 kills in a row. *basketball* Reduce the variables in your jumpshot. toes, knees, elbows wrist, and finger tips will all effect your shot. Not to mention balance, arc and the actual direction of the ball. Get them all the same every time exept a couple so its more scientific. So you should shoot the same except maybe bend your knees more and flick your wrist a differently. Sounds obvious until you start missing and don't know why.	Insurance guy here - when filling out any kind of insurance paperwork remind yourself of 1 simple thing: only answer the question that is asked. Don't go off on a tangent about how you had a celebratory cigar at your daughters wedding when you apply for life insurance. No, you aren't a smoker but since you technically had nicotine in your system, you are fucked. Just answer what they ask. Don't volunteer any info. If they want to know something, they'll ask you for it. During any claims process there are tons of safety checks to verify your answers. Don't withhold info cuz that will bite you in the ass, but don't volunteer more than what the insurance company is asking. You'll could save thousands over the course of your lifetime.
What was the biggest controversy on reddit?	Tecent controversy that actually has any ground to stand on? Probably the recent turn towards a biased pro censorship style of moderation from the admins.	Reddit detectives pinning the wrong guy as the Boston bomber. The guy they blamed has long been dead before the bombing. They doxxed and harrased the guy's family, who at the time was still grieving for their son.
What is the most chilling phone call you've ever received?	Shortly after I got braces I got a phone call from my orthodontist, here's how it went: "hello child ,I'm going to rape you in your sleep" . I called the cops on him ,then I found he's also a sex offender	"Hi this is Kate. Brodys girlfriend. Do you remember me?" "Yes. I'm at work though. Why have you been calling me?" "Brody just killed himself. Thought you should hear it from me, since you guys were really close." Edit for backstory: I was working one night and my cellphone kept ringing every 10 minutes, and the caller wasn't someone I had saved as a contact. I wasn't allowed to answer my phone on the clock, so I finally got to answer on a break. That's why I was a little short with her, I didn't like being bugged at work. I quickly dropped the attitude once she told me why she had been calling so frantically.
People of reddit who don't talk to their parents, why dont you?	Hey guys, I will try to respond as much as possible when I wake up but I just finished a 12 hour night shift and cannot stay up any longer	My biological father is dead. My stepfather sexually molested me for a couple years when I was young. When I finally told my mother, she asked me why I was trying to ruin her marriage. "Family" means nothing to me.
What's the worst excuse to break up one can give?	"My friends don't like you because you are too rich". As the tale goes, he had a fat female friend who just didn't like me (we had never met in person or even spoken). She didn't like me because my parents were upper-middle class and her's weren't. I was skinny and what some people might call "pretty" and she wasn't. Good old fashioned jealousy. She was no moron though because she was smart enough to convince this guy to break it off with me. Of course, he realized he had made a mistake and tried to get back together with me. "Sorry", I said, "But I can't date anyone as poor as you".	I got broken up with because I "allowed" my boyfriend to go on a trip with his friends out of state. He told me that it was obvious I didn't care about him because if I did I wouldn't let him go on a trip where he would probably cheat on me. Still doesn't make sense to me.
Hair-Cutters of Reddit: Do you wish I spoke more in the chair, or do you hate small talk as much as I do?	Seriously, guys. You should look at it as more than getting a haircut. It helps if you have a couple drinks beforehand, but you can fully utilize them for life counseling. If that's not your thing, hairstylists usually get into some crazy cool sketchy shit, so ask them about it. I can get my hair cut well by most hairstylists, but ill pay well for one that can keep it entertaining.	Depends on the person. If you're a gossip, I'd prefer you STFU. If you have something interesting to say, then I'd love to talk. It's up to you, though. You are the customer, and I'm willing to to do whichever (talk or not) makes you most comfortable in my chair.
Hey reddit, there's a fairly good chance I'm gonna die soon, what are some things you always wanted to do in your life?	"It's so sad. How did he die?" "His foot had an infection" "Thats it? Seriously? Lol, what a pussy!" "Lol, I know right!"	That must be some sort of infection. I've always wanted to tip waiters/waitresses ridiculously high amounts, buy a round for every person at a bar, or give away money on the street.
Who would you be more scared of if they aggressively approached you in a dark alley: a fit 6’2” 220 lbs man wielding no weapons or a fit 5’5” 120 lbs woman wielding a knife? And why?	A guy, of course. Because 1-an alley is a close quarters place to fight and he, even if he doesn't know martial arts, it's big enough to at least pin you to a wall because he has size and strength. 2-The woman has neither size, nor strength, so you can dodge her attacks and run or try to overpower her. 3- Even if it's dark, the sole presence of a guy blocking your path, will be enough to make you scare more easily than a thin woman.	Police officer here, just a piece of advice. If someone pulls a gun or threatens to beat your ass, be afraid, but they probably won’t. It’s intimidating you to get what they want. If someone pulls a knife, they plan to hurt you.
I may not be your child or be related to you but what is one heart warming piece of advice you can give to a 16 year old?	Don't get married or have kids until you are 30 and have your education finished and your career sorted out.	Some adults will tell you this is 'the best years of your life'. That's nostalgia talking. There's much better to come.
How did you imagine your life 15 years ago?	In the womb...so dark...I kick and struggle to get out but they only laugh and caress the walls of my cell. Finally, onw day, LIGHT! I cry tears of joy and scream at the world for being so cruel to me. But now...its all over. I'm free.	At age 10 I imagined I would be rich, famous and married with kids by now, mainly because 25 seemed ancient to me back then, and kids are stupid. I'm doing ok, things haven't quite gone my way yet but they're getting there.
What's one movie everybody loves that you can't stand?	Star Wars Episode I Sorry, I'm a die hard Star Wars fan but give me a break, if I wanted to watch intergalactic political shit is watch Star Trek (here come the down votes)	Grease. Hey, here's a healthy message for young girls - just change everything about yourself, become a megaslut, and maybe John Travolta will fuck you!
What is your best NSFW story from living in the dorms?	Non-NSFW: My freshman year, some drunk decided it would be funny to haul in a propane tank--in the process, the nozzle got damaged and propane was leaking everywhere. Getting woken from a dead sleep by the fire alarm and having to go outside on a cold Vermont night is not my idea of fun. Probably not NSFW but more borderline: I was hanging with some friends and a big jug of cheap vodka starts making the rounds. Before I knew it I was absolutely hammered. Woke up the next morning in my bed, with an inflated condom on the floor and a bruise the size of a silver dollar on the center of my forehead and no memory how it got there. I can only guess that I'd gotten up in the middle of the night and tripped over my desk chair.	Guy that lived down the hall screwed a girl in the common room. A couple of guys tried to go in there whilst it was happening but he locked the door but they heard what was going on. So they summoned the entire floor to stand outside and yell encouragement to him. He then tried to convince us to go away. Him: "Go back to your rooms!" Us: "Wait a second... Brad?!" Him: ... Him: "This isn't Brad!" Sure thing. Then he got into a bit of trouble afterwards for putting the used condom on the RA's doorknob but ya know.
Ladies of Reddit, what can make a not-so-handsome guy really attractive?	Three things attract women: Success, Social Status, and Sex appeal. You only need 2/3 to bag most chicks. Note: "Social status" includes the popular answers in this thread thus far; Being happy, confident, cool, clever, etc.	I find responsibility and ambition extremely attractive. It's not about money. It's about a guy who has his shit together, who's looking for a partner and not a mother.
Believers of the Dec 21st doomsday, why do you believe and what convinced you?	No one here or anywhere actually believes this, they just talk about it because they're bored and can't think of anything smart to talk about. You're not going to get a single genuine answer here. Not one.	Acquaintances of mine who are doomsday believers cite the growing frequency of natural disasters in the past few years (which I'm not even sure is factual).
What is the most disturbing thing that has ever woken you up.?	I once woke up to my bed and myself covered in blood. I jumped up and looked down and what was staring back at me made me scream the loudest I've ever screamed. A horse I'd paid 400,000 for's head was lying at the end of my bed. Johnny Fontane got the part.	My family always have a good laugh at my cousin for this one. The story is his brother came home drunk as shit, and really needed to take a piss. Only problem is he was half asleep and could barely stand up. He walked into the wrong room, didn't even switch the light on, and started pissing all over his younger brothers face. Apparently all my Uncle heard was my cousin shouting 'THIS ISN'T THE TOILET ! THIS ISN'T THE TOILET !' Then they heard my older cousin scream whilst taking an uppercut striahgt to the ball bag. ...Wish I could have been there.
Customers of restaurants that's appeared on Gordon Ramsey's kitchen nightmares, what was the food actually like before and after the show helped the resturant?	Seriously, why you guys keep misspelling his name, is Ramsay, with an A! Every fucking thread Edit: fuck my life, I suck at english and I wasn't paying attention. Also, My point still valid cause you can see Gordon's name anywhere and still fuck it up	Live in Denver, where a pizzeria called Pantaleone's that was on the show is located. I have eaten there off and on for almost 25 years believe it or not. The pizza was always good, very expensive and often unavailable (because of the odd hours and habits of the owner). The owner is a cantankerous guy that seems not to care much about what his customers think of his place. After the show, you can see that the menu is more standardized, but honestly I see no change in the place. I'm honestly curious how he keeps the place open sometimes. If he just hired a delivery person and gave two shits about customer service, this place would probably dominate the neighborhood.
Once a teacher raided his closet for clothes I could wear to a scholarship interview. I attribute my entire college education, and my career for his kindness. How has someone changed your life for the better?	When I was 16 I did something dumb that could have gotten me in a lot of trouble. The cop brought me into his office (at school) where I confessed to it and he could see I truely regretted it. He then gave me a disorderly conduct ticket instead of what he has could have given me which would have done a lot of damage to my future. I owe that man a lot.	A good friend once told me I was the rudest person he had ever met. Turned my manners around literally overnight.
Women of Reddit, what's the creepiest thing a man has said to you?	My friend used to dare me to say weird shit to people at parties. Once I whispered to a girl: "Your hair reminds me of a dream I once had."	I was ten and walking home from school alone in the middle of the day. An old man with a horrendous dye job stopped me, grabbed me by the shoulder and said "Hey there, pretty little girl. Wanna sit on Papa's lap and make him feel good?" I ran all the way home and I could hear him laughing behind me. It's been what, twelve years or so, and I still remember his face, down to the creepy grin.
[Serious] Men of Reddit who have been raped by women, what happened, did you tell anyone, and did they take you seriously?	She didn’t cause physical harm, just took advantage of my drunkedness, I was kinda disappointed by it and we don’t keep in contact but no big deal.	I've posted this a few times, here it is again. Long story short: Late night after the bars in college, I go home and passed out, girl knocks on my door and asks if I'm home, we know her so my roommate says yeah and lets her in. She goes straight to my room where somehow, while I lay lifeless passed out drunk, she gets me hard and starts riding me. My roommate opens my door and flips on the light and asks if she even put a condom on me first, she says no, and he kicks her out. I am informed of all this in the morning. Scary the idea that if the roles were reversed, it'd be a severely different story but I personally didn't really care nor did anyone else when I told them. Every single response was "that's awesome easiest lay of your life"
As an adult, how do you make new friends?	1. Casually approach 2. Suck his dick 3. He calls you every day if he can fuck you 4. Best friends for life	Assume everyone wants to be friends with you. Sure you'll be wrong some, but some people are just like you.
What video game would you like to play as the Villain, trying to defeat the hero?	**KILLZONE** The "good guys" are so painfully miserable faux-tactical bro-douchebag that the first time I played, I thought it was a parody. But no, it's just SCEA and their pet developers, technical skill aside, being laughably tone-deaf.	I would love a game where you play as a Police officer in the Grand Theft Auto series, and you have to deal with the maniacs killing swathes of people and causing incredible amounts of damage.
Tell me reddit... if you were dying and chosen for the make-a-wish program, what would your request be?	I would ask my hot coworker for a blowjob, and if she refuses I would die saying: 'You selfish person, you had the opportunity to grant a dying persons last wish, but you denied them that. And now you will have to live with the consequences for the rest of your life knowing that I would have died a peacefull death if you had given me a blowjob '. She would then feel guilty and start sucking away.	I want Norm McDonald to write and read a eulogy for me. I want it to start out really positive and slowly get really mean until he's essentially telling everyone at my funeral what an asshole I was. Then right at the end he tips over my casket, but I'm not in it. Instead it's filled with candy and Norm tells everyone that I was actually cremated and I set up this whole thing as my final joke. Weeks later he'll hold a press conference and reveal that after I was cremated they put my ashes into the candy and that all my loved ones ate me. Then he has to stare at the camera for a full minute while everyone processes what happened.
Redditors in their 50s+ who have kept up with a daily journal since their teens - what's your favorite page to go back to and read?	I'm in late 40s so not really applicable per se but I've kept my journal since age 9...I mostly wrote about feelings of weakness and insecurity but I had one period in my life that was a little slice of heaven. I was so happy and would write 2 or 3 pages using cringey words and ideas to explain my new found joy. I read the page where I describe how I first found that joy by swallowing the load of a local vagabond in exchange for half his rotten banana. Both treats were body temperature and slightly chunky in my mouth. I miss visiting trashcan willy, I'm sure he's dead by now but I still think of him when I read that passage Edit. You insensitive down voting pricks	My mom is almost 60 and used to journal prolifically. Me and my sister randomly opened one of her old ones, it was from the 80s before we were born and the first line was "too much crank! Too much coke!" My mom threw her old journals out after that, what a shame!
Former pickpockets of Reddit, where's the best place to keep phone/wallet/keys so they're safe when traveling to congested cities?	I travel all the time, and keep a "mugger's wallet" on me. The wallet has about $10 cash, cancelled (but not expired) credit cards, and "filler" such as old receipts and coupons to make it look real. I keep it in my side pocket. If someone steals it/robs me, I only lose $10. I keep my real wallet inside a special inside-jacket pocket. Don't keep a license in a mugger wallet, they might retaliate if they know where you live.	I'm surprised someone hasn't mentioned one of the easiest & cheapest ways to prevent pickpocketing; take a few rubber bands and wrap them around your wallet/cellphone.
What are your most controversial beliefs?	Au revoir comment karma! Hitler had a good thing going, right up until he attacked poland. Not his methods or beliefs per se, but he got shit done. He knew how to rule a country. I do not hate the jews. I am not a NAZI. I'm an atheist.	I believe my cousin which has been "diagnosed" with being developmentally delayed (and pumped full of drugs) is actually delayed because her parents have fed her formula to the age of 7 and if she had proper nutrition she would do a thousand times better. Apparently not cool to mention that fact in my family.
What's your biggest "Oh shit, that actually worked" moment?	Driving home from work. Its like 930.On the interstate speeding. Big construction area but its late at night no ones working. Suddenly see a cop. Couple people around me but he was obviously going for me. I switch lanes in front of another car right in front of an exit. I go straight Car behind me turns off at the exit. Cop follows him and I get away free. Tickets for that area can be pretty big and our cops can be dicks. Feel bad for the poor bastard who got my speeding ticket	I work a nobody job doing boring repetitive warehouse work. My boss asked if I wanted to manifest which means to use a program to print labels and track packages. I accepted and within a week my boss told me I was almost better than him at it. It made me appear to be really good at computers so just for the hell of it, I asked if he'd consider moving me in to the IT department. To my surprise, he said he'd definitely consider it and would be happy to talk to his boss about it.
What thing in a movie makes it instantly a bad movie?	Whitewashing. Like, blatantly white washing. When things like Gods of Egypt or Prince of Persia cast white actors as the main characters, it really fucking enrages me and I will refuse to watch it. Also Last Airbender. Katara & Souka were darker skinned in the original show. The movie didn't even bother making them Inuit. To a lesser degree, stuff like Hunger Games - Katniss' race was never specified but she was described in the book as having olive skin. And yes, white people can have olive undertones. But that would have been a great opportunity to maybe cast someone who wasn't super fucking white for once. I love Jennifer Lawrence to pieces, but god damn.	When a romance begins when a guy and a girl LITERALLY bump into each other. Bonus points if they slyly smile at each other while he helps her pick up whatever stuff she dropped.
What's the one thing you'll never forget your parents saying?	"It's dangerous to go alone, take this." Just kidding, the main thing was "You'll understand when you're older", nope, I still think your religion is false, and don't agree with many of your actions.	"I love you." Said every time we get off the phone. I know they mean it, and it always sticks.
What is the most unfair thing that has ever happened to you?	I was born. Out of 99.99...% of the matter in this solar system, much less the universe, a small piece became me. This is incredibly unfair compared to the vast majority of the universe which remains inert. I am, and those I share this planet with, are privileged in being alive.	Married who I thought was the love of my life. 79 days later came home found her dead in the living room. Suicide. She had been having an affair.
Ladies of Reddit, what subtle clues do you give your man when your in the "mood"?	Most girls here say "works every time" but I'm curious what happens in the reverse when the guy makes it obvious, does it, "work every time" still?	Not a lady, but my wife like to seductively Block out 30 minutes on her dayplanner a week in advance. It's hot.
Why is there so little discussion about the fact that the same families seem to hold several political posts in the U.S.?	We know that we're free, because the ones who rule us tell us we are. It's all a joke. Of course our herd managers prefer to concentrate power and wealth within their own families. This is how it's always been done.	haahahah you should see Greece: previous Prime minister's father was also Prime minister, his father was also Prime minister. (3 generations) George Papandreou - Andreas Papandreou - George Papandreou. The Prime minister before the latest Papandreou - Kostas Karamanlis - is one of the nephews of another Prime minister also named Kostas Karamanlis. A grandchild is also running now. One of the candidates running now (and has been in politics for all his life) had a grand father who was also a Prime minister (Venizelos) Another one (Pagalos) had a grandfather who became head of state through a military coup. We are talking highly ranked here (vice-presidents of the party, economics, foreign affairs, defence). Now there is also a woman (Bakogianni) who is the daughter of a previous Prime minister called Mitsotakis, she left her father's party and is now back in again, her brother (Kyriakos) never left the party.
[Serious] What was your experience when you were mugged?	Attacked at ATM, by black man who was "tired of seeing white people" Police did nothing with description of vehicle and tag number, had left my pistol in the car, they did tell me they would have charged me with murder if I had shot the guy. Got the impression they are not in my side.	I actually have a bad story turned into a good story. I was probably 7 years old and walking around Bradleys with my mom's friend who was babysitting me. I thought it was weird that my mom's friend always talked to me weird and touched me weird. She put me into the center of one of the clothing racks and started to touch me inappropriately. At the time I didn't know what was happening. From behind a man came up and asked for her money and to not make a scene. Being the idiot she was she let out a scream and the man ran out of the store. Afterwards they watch the security footage. There I am getting molested in the middle of a clothing store. Tldr: Mugger stopped me from getting molested. Mother's friend got in a lot of trouble.
Redditors what's the stupidest thing you've said to a police officer?	"Just because I'm doing 85 in a 35 zone is no reason to tailgate me. And those flashing lights on top of your car makes you look stupid" By the way, can anyone go to my gofundme page and donate something? I need money for bail.	Coming back from South Padre Island, we had to cross the border back into USA, border patrol stopped us and asked if we had anything in the car. For whatever reason, my friend and I start elbowing the back seat and loudly whisper "Silencio" frantically. We got searched. Edit: This was the spring break after 9/11. We had gotten stopped in the USA. But it was right on where the border would be if it was a straight line. No jail time, just some scolding from my friend's mom. The officers didn't want to be there and everyone could tell.
People who've worked the Overnight Shift, what's the weirdest thing you've encountered on the job?	Worked security. Power went out in a building the size of a small town. Zombie apocalypse for days. Wasn't too bad. Kinda fun all things considering. Power was out for a few days, and security works ESPECIALLY during those times.	Used to work at a movie theatre, our ice machine was in this old basement, went down there to fill giant tubs of ice, as I was going down there it was creepy dark and all you can hear is the hum of the ice maker, as soon as I step in there all the light go on, I get the ice come back. Tell the manager good thing we have sensor lights, cause if not I would have not been able to get the ice. He states there are no sensor lights, we ran down there lights are off and he shows me the switch. Yup never went to get ice again.
If Reddit enjoys original content, why do self posts get no karma?	/r/atheism and a lot of the other discussion boards most of the time are mindless circlejerks that I wouldn't really consider OC if they want the karma, post it in the comments and get it from that.	They used to get karma, and the front page used to be filled with "Upvote this if you hate Bush" and "Upvote this if you think Reddit is cool".
How has your appearance made your life easier/harder?	Well I appear white, and I am a female that people often find attractive. It is actually quite useful if I need to get someones attention or something of the like. I wont say I never bat my eyelashes to get something I need. Although I would never take it far enough to hurt anyone. The worst way my appearance effects me is that I cant be in public without being bothered or cat called. It doesn't help that I'm the type that dresses weird and has tattoos and such. My appearance is quite loud but despite that I actually don't want attention and have a bit of anxiety about it. Being cat called is something I have a severe hatred for. It makes me feel like meat on display. Sometimes I wish I could just be a fat guy in a grey sweater while I'm in public.	I'm a 22 white male and I have the male equivalent to "resting bitch face" which is "resting pissed off face". It makes life harder because everyone tells me I am very unapproachable at first until you get to know me, then I turn into a really kind guy. I never really noticed it until college when I was told to "not look so angry all the time". I don't do it on purpose! I just zone out, and mind my own business. It makes life easier because I never get harassed by people handing out flyers and such.
You are the annoying wizard who can cast a single mildly annoying curse on people. Which curse do you cast to make sure their life is a living hell?	You know the thing in Liar Liar where he can't speak a lie? That. I would do that. Because that would result in utter hilarity.	Every time they're about to click a link, something further up the page loads and they click on the wrong thing
How do you tell a dorm mate that they smell like SHIT?	Maybe subtly leave deodorant outside her door. Then gradually move up to lotions, shampoo, body wash. Then finally leave her a basket filled with soaps and the like.	Only on the internet can 50 some-odd strangers come together and discuss the possible reasoning for one smelly dorm mate.
Reddit, I am 17 and in my 2nd year of college (compsci) and my parents are basically making me drop out of school. I'm clueless. Help?	>not a single dropped class or F (I'm not a bad student, but shit happens and this is a till-i-graduate thing) Well no, shit doesn't just happen. This flippant attitude will be something that upsets them, most likely. That's their money you're burning.	What worries me the most is that they'll try to make you drop your CS degree. That's one of the best degrees you can get right now in terms of finding a job.
Car enthusiasts of Reddit. I am the proud owner of a new car, yet my knowledge of cars is moderate at best. What are some tips and tricks to maintaining my car for the long run?	Modern cars don't need much. I'll answer this even though I kinda want to smack you right now. * Find out the recommended, routine maintenance (car handbook or teh innernette) and follow it. (e.g. 60k miles change timing belts, etc) * Change your oil as recommended, usually every 3k miles. Rotate your tires every other oil change or so. That's really all that needs to be done, besides the obvious like keep it filled with gas, add antifreeze as needed (ensuring to drink a bit to make sure it's still good), and not turn hard in the rain so you flip it into a ditch. Bonus: if you are making out with a girl, get on top of her in the passenger seat - *not* the back seat. Once you push the seat back, it's way more comfortable.	do you own synthetic oil changes. youtube can teach you in about 3 minutes. change your spark plugs and filters on schedule. it's as easy as using a ratchet. then move onto changing your brakes yourself. Disc brakes are incredibly simple to change, both pads and rotors. Again, watch some youtube videos, get the haynes manual for your car, and give it a shot. You probably know someone who has done it before than can supervise your first one. Also, brake pads usually have a lifetime guarantee and rotors a two year guarantee. So you buy the first set, then change them every 23 months for free. Just bring the old parts back to autozone and you get a refund. Free brakes for the life of the car.
Reddit, what is the creepiest "glitch in the matrix" you've experienced?	My glitch in the matrix is that I swear I have seen this exact question dozens of times, but everyone acts like it's the first time	I was chasing a bug that was zipping around my apartment, moving oddly - like it'd stop and 'hover' (not quite the right word, more like it'd stop and freeze in place mid-air) regularly. My girlfriend came over asking what the hell I was doing - "trying to kill this weird bug" - and we're both looking at it against a solid white background when it just... vanishes. Stopped existing. We looked EVERYWHERE, nothing. Bug just teleported out of the apartment.
What is the best thing about winter?	The first day you see snow and then thats it. It's nothing but but a sick and twisted hell that lasts for 7-8 months.	The smell of winter air. Crisp and cold in your nostrils. Being able to drink hot coffee/beverages whenever you want(with good reason, because it's cold outside!). Sleeping incredibly well at night under a thick comforter. The smell of wood burning in a fireplace, when you're walking around your neighborhood. Walking around the house in thick warm socks and a sweater. ...sorry, that's more than one thing, but they all count.
[Serious] What's some of the most fucked up parenting you've ever witnessed?	I've seen so many cases of parents buying their children stuff so the kid will shut up. Like you'll be out buying some food and the kid is screaming because he can't have 2 chocolate bars, and eventually the parents cave "Ok, if you'll stop screaming you can have them! You're making a scene" You know what you're supposed to do in that situation? Give him a clip round the earhole and tell him he's getting nothing for being a greedy pig. Kid wants to have a fit, leave him locked in the car while you finish shopping.	During my clinical rotation on a pediatric unit, there was a deaf and blind baby, being fed through a stomach tube. His mom's boyfriend had shaken the shit out of him, and his mom wanted to keep him alive so the boyfriend didn't go to jail. She hardly ever visited. When she did, she had no patience for the little guy. No warmth. It was so depressing. Peds, never again.
What's a job that most people wouldn't know actually exists?	I'm a sniper for outdoor music festivals and big events. I'm hired to watch the stage/crowd and pick off anyone that poses a threat to the artists' safety. I can only fire when: 1) The attacker has a weapon (eg. gun or knife) 2) There is intent to harm the artist I am only on call for big name acts. There can be more than one of us hired (eg. for the Rio Olympics there are 12 of us hired to perch on top of the stadium for opening/closing ceremonies). Normally for the music acts, we will be in the tower canopy with the film crew.	Once got paid for a month of 40-hour work weeks for sitting at a gate and watching to make sure no cows got out. I was a "Bovine Identification and Exit Prevention Specialist." Never saw a fucking cow. Read some good books, though.
What is something hilarious that you can't tell anyone about because it's too inappropriate?	I frequently rip farts in the vicinity of dementia patients and not once have I been blamed for it. It's the perfect cover.	I wanted to be nice and smooth for when I saw my boyfriend so I decided to try to wax at home. The wax wasn't very good and dried to quick before I could do it properly, so when I went to do the back I ended up gluing my ass cheeks together and it took me 45 minutes to figure out how to get them unstuck and to remove the excesse wax that had dried on me. Baby oil eventually did the trick.
[Serious] To those who have social anxiety, what is it like for you?	I feel as though everywhere I go, everything I do, everyone is critiquing my every move, my clothes, my hair, voice, choice of words etc as much as I am critiquing myself. You know the saying something like "You're your own harshest judge", well it's like that only I assume everyone else is thinking all the negative things about me that I'm thinking about myself. How could they not?	Constant thoughts running a mile a minute. If I know I'm gonna have to speak someone in advance, I just obsess over it every minute leading up to it. Sometimes it makes me physically sick, shaking, nauseated or upset stomach... Then when I do talk to people I over analyze every little motion. How I said something, was I making too much eye contact, not enough. What my face looks like, every smile every blink. I'm extremely aware of my hands and that makes me even more fidgety. Sometimes days later I'm still thinking about some little detail which logically I know they probably didn't even think twice about but to me it's just nagging my brain endlessly. Half the time I have to force myself to say anything to anyone, and I'm hyperaware of how awkwardly quiet I must come off... It's fun...
What are some things worth memorizing?	The front door of the apartment of the truckstop skank you just picked up after killing a liter of Crystal Palace vodka by yourself in that booth at the Roy Rogers. Trust me, you'll want to be miles away when you finally sober up.	Converting pounds in kg: half the figure then subtract ten percent of the halved figure. So for 40lbs, half is 20, minus 2 is 18kg.
Driving instructors of Reddit, what are your worst student driver experiences?	Not a driving instructor BUT the student. I was fairly decent at driving (apart from almost driving into Simon Cowell's mum's car once), and that was great. However on one of my lessons the driving instructor wanted me to go around the block just to fill up the hour. i did. I had to move the car quickly to avoid somebody was clearly speeding. I hit the kerb and the tire burst. She said I had to pay £200 to get it replaced. She said it had happened three times that week and she did not want to claim on her insurance again. I never drove with her again.	my uncle frequently tells the story of the time his driving instructor died during his first lesson and he was given some award from the town for driving the body to the hospital.
What is the most extreme example of helicopter parenting that you have ever witnessed?	Like my parents I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “Apache” and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can’t accept me you’re a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.	A guy at my high school last year wrote some college application essays, and after his parents read them they kicked him out of his own account, changed the password, and rewrote them entirely.
You've been convincingly framed for a murder you didn't commit and now must flee -- where do you go and what do you do?	Run away and learn the way of the Assassin, then take revenge on the framers. I'd also legally change my name to Ezio Auditore.	I'm surprised nobody has suggested Seychelles. They don't have extradition treaties with anybody. Even if you're found, you'd have to leave the country by choice to be arrested.
I've changed my sweater three times at work today to see if anyone would notice. What have you done to entertain yourself at work today?	My co-worker used to ejaculate into our female co-workers' water bottles. One uptight bitch finally caught on and made a huge fuss about it and got him fired and on the newspaper. Ruined the poor guys life.	I do some part time work at university hockey games as the PA announcer. At the beginning of the games, when I read the scratches, I will often throw in movie characters. Like "#29 John McClane". No one has noticed yet. Yippie kay yay
Germans of reddit: how noticeable is the refugee crisis in your day to day life?	I live in Norway where we have gotten a lot less refugees (as a matter of fact due to new and strict laws we have only gotten a few hundred so far this year). But we have gone from having few to a lot of immigrants in the last 15 years. And the biggest change for me is simply the fact that I see them all the time. I know its petty, but I don't like that. As a child I rarely saw middle eastern people, when I did it felt kind of exotic, the norm was that the streets where littered with white Norwegian people. But now I see a lot of middle eastern people walking around in hijabs and generally not looking Norwegian or European for that matter, and for reasons I can't explain I just don't like it.	I think living in The Netherlands is quite comparable to Germany but it isn't really noticeable. Every once in a while there are little riots for opening a new shelter in a city but that's all really. Sometimes I see a refugee but they are nice and are really grateful, what you hear in the media are only the worst ones. It's true but exaggerated.
Did you ever have an altercation with someone only to realize that you were the one being the asshole?	This will probably get buried, as per usual, but anyways I used to be a waiter at a certain sit down restaurant. I got really pissed at this family and thought they were ass holes because they virtually stiffed me on a decently sized check. It was a Mom and her two daughters, they were twins and appeared to be 18. We got into a heated argument right in the middle of the restaurant, heads were turning all over. My manager's door busts open. At this point, she began to slowly kiss her way down to my cock. I wasn't sure if I should sit down or keep standing, I'd never been in this situation before! I didn't have to worry though, as my legs began to buckle. She then sat on top of me and placed my dick into her moist lips	Accidentally cut guy off in traffic. Got flustered when I realized what I had done. Didn't know what to do, so gave him the finger. He looked confused.
My 15 year old brother just watched a girl commit suicide. How do I know he is okay?	When you teach him how to kill, you will need to insure he lives by a code. 1. Never get caught 2. Never kill innocents. Also teach him to never make a scene, to fake being normal to fit in, and lastly, when taking a personality test, always always answer the question opposite of how you feel.	When I was 13, I found my boyfriend after he killed himself with a shotgun. I didn't talk to anyone about it afterwards, because no one seemed interested in listening to me sob about it. Just the fact that you are there for him, that you care, that you're willing to listen is a huge help to him. As long as you make it clear that if he wants to talk about it you will be there, there's not a whole lot else you can do. Take him out to do fun things and distract him from what happened. If he rides the bus every day, maybe you could take him to school for a while. I can't imagine wanting to get on the bus for a long time after an experience like that.
People of Reddit, what is the most brilliant cheating techniques you've ever witnessed at school/college?	Once I saw someone cheat by memorizing all the facts and methods they needed to use. I mean, it's brilliant! They've never ever got cought!	Probably the best way i have seen someone cheat took place in my high school spanish class. This one kid wrote answers on the waistband of his pants. He would periodically peek down at his pants and pull the waistband out a bit revealing what he had wrote. Soon the teacher noticed and asked him loudly what he was up to, thinking she had busted him. Without missing a beat the kid looks up and says to her, "I was actually just adjusting my boner, but thanks for calling me out." The entire class burst out laughing. The teacher had no way of responding to what was just said..Kid never got questioned about it again.
What’s the weirdest thing a guest has done at your house?	Went to my friend's house and straight up told her that I'm gonna take a shit. That and that she asked me to sleep on the bed with her.	Shit all over the wall. We were having some extended family over for Thanksgiving and about halfway through the Thanksgiving party this couple shows up with a baby I assume I'm related to them somehow but not 100% sure I had never met them before. The dad excuses himself to the bathroom, comes out telling his wife they need to go. I don't think anything of it, until I go to the bathroom maybe 5 minutes later. The wall behind the toilet is covered in shit it was like it was blasted with a shotgun shell full of shit. Our family now refers to this as the great Thanksgiving blowout. I have never seen those people again. I've assumed they've disowned themselves from the family.
I’m 41. Born in ‘76. In the US. Why does it seem like there’s such a huge difference between the 70’s and the 90’s, but not the same between the 90’s and now. Is this how everyone feels when they reach middle age, or is there less of a cultural difference between the last two generations?	I was born in the early 90s, to me theres a huge difference, i went from a typewriter (originally having to write by hand obviously) to being able to use this small mobile device in my hand to write what ever i need and also delete words without white-out, plus no "eeeeeeeee aaawwwwwwww eeeeeeeeee awwwwwwww phpdhsjdoencjfksldnf" internet lol	I'm 37, born in '80. I know the feel. I think it's more the cultural difference. We grew up without the internet until our teens/20s where as kids born in the 90s and later were born into the digital age and have been surrounded by it pretty much their entire lives.
Gamers of Reddit, what is the best quote ever in a video game?	"Even the terrible floods were not enough to wash away the sorrows of Dunwall" from my favourite game of all time : Dishonored !	>Too many people have opinions on things they know nothing about, and the more ignorant they are, the more opinions they have. -Thomas Hilden, Fallout: New Vegas It's not that funny of a quote, or that meaningful towards the story, but it is still one of my favorite quotes I've heard in a game due to its meaning.
[Serious] Religious people of reddit, would the discovery of life on another planet/moon (intelligent or not) cause you to question your beliefs? Why or why not?	Well, it's an obvious yes. I wouldn't say that the existence of single-celled life would matter, but the existence of intelligent life would certainly call into question man being created in God's image. I don't think it would cause me to *abandon* my faith, but I seriously doubt the existence of aliens, and I'm confident that they'll never, ever be discovered.	Not at all. The Bible is a pretty specific narrative that is the story of humanity and it's relationship with God. It already doesn't cover all knowledge ever, so aliens wouldn't inherently disprove or prove our believes.
What TV show did you stop watching mid-series, and why?	It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Don't get me wrong, it's a hilarious show and is as well written as they come, but the characters are just such assholes that I couldn't continue. They never learned from any of their mistakes and they never felt bad about anything they did.	Once Upon A Time. Great premise, and I was hooked after the Beauty and the Beast episode...But then the characters got super annoying and a lot of the characters regressed. It got super repetitive. Also, the Frozen storyline wasn't that great.
Forever Aloners: If you think you're reasonably attractive, yet still forever alone, why do you think that is?	I'm nice and I respect women, so I get stepped all over. Maybe it's because I'm not forward enough, but if I go to parties the girls always end up talking to the big tough guy that just wants to get with them.	I'm extremely shy. It's near impossible for me to start a conversation with someone I don't know, and even harder to carry a conversation. I tend to just trip over my words and look like a complete idiot.
Teachers of reddit, what shit goes on at schools that students don't know about?	Priscilla, philosophy teacher at CSUSB, guess what?, I graduated medical school, I'm near the end of my career, and YOU were the worst instructor I ever had.	In some places, before the school year starts, teachers will trade students like an NFL Draft. I'll trade you Timmy and Butters for Kenny. You can have Kenny, but I'm going to need you to also take Eric. Ohh - Uh - Eric is an asshole. No Eric, No Kenny. Deal.
What are the most mind-blowing facts about the human brain?	All I know about it is that it is inside my head and it keeps bugging me. I want to go to a theater and watch a movie. No. I want to.. No. I want to... I said that is enough.	What freaks me out is how little control we have over it. Even with voluntary movements we're really only able to easily execute actions (grabbing things for example) because our cerebellum unconsciously fine tunes the whole motion. I once had a professor describe consciousness as this tiny self aware portion of the frontal lobe sitting on top of an inordinately complex machine, and for everything the machine does it says: "hey I did that." Although he was exaggerating a bit, it definitely messes with my head.
Redditors who are essay scorers for standardized tests, what is the most ridiculous essay that you have ever graded?	I have a teacher who used to score STAAR test essays. Ill ask him to drop a reply to this thread tomorrow.	My English teacher, who grades IB English world literature papers, read this brilliant opening sentence from an essay about *The Reader*: "Being that I am of German descent, I am a Holocaust enthusiast." It didn't even matter what was after that.
What's the most ridiculous lie you've ever got somebody to believe?	in middle school we kept telling this dumb kid that when you hit puberty you grow a third nut. he originally called bullshit but we had like a dozen dudes all telling him the same thing so he ended up buying it cause one day we were like "hey fag, your third nut start growing yet?" and he was like "...yeah" we laughed at him so bad, fuckin guy	I convinced two colleagues that in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Taco Bell was selling tacos with pink taco shells, but in order to get them, you had to specifically ask for pink tacos. Both of them went to Taco Bell, separately, and both of them returned to work screaming at me for making fools of them.
People with a criminal record, how hard is it to lead a normal life, and what are some unexpected consequences ?	One of my.mates did 3 years for drug related offences. When he got out he applied for a job as a mechanic at a contract company. During his interview the boss said that he forgot to fill out the criminal history part of the application. Mate said he didn't forget, he just wanted the chance to explain in person. They discussed what he had done and the employee wrote in big letters across the front NO GOLD MINES.	My friend just spent thousands to sit the medical school entrance exam in my country. Achieved top marks in undergraduate too, received 3 offers from medical schools. He went to enroll in his top preference and failed the police check. There was a committee meeting, and they refused him entry. I'm not sure what the crime was, only that it happened awhile ago and he states he's remorseful. He contacted the other two medical schools with the situation, and they told him not to bother re-applying. He thought about applying his top undergraduate marks to law schools, but they said not to try. I don't know what he'll do, he's still working as a waiter currently.
Reddit, What is your stupidest fight a SO has started with you?	We were at a wedding of her cousin and she had some tea. She begins to pour insaaaane ammounts of sugar in like 0,1 liters of tea. I look at her and say: "wow thats a lot of sugar, you must love sweet things but maybe thats the reason we´re together right?" *wink, wink* she answerd "WHAT THE FUCK, you are judging me, I´m not fat I can drink what I want hurrdurr..." She got so mad that she didn´t want to talk to me for like 5 hours. Bitches, man	I spent months putting together the perfect birthday present for him, and I was super excited to give it to him - I knew he'd love it. When the day came, I realized I was all out of colored wrapping paper so I wrapped the box in brown paper instead. And he flipped the fuck out on me, and yelled at me for an hour straight until I was a sobbing mess, because the paper was wrong. (All this without even opening it). Eventually he did open it, glanced at it without taking it out of the box, and left it on the floor. A few months later I found the box shoved into his storage unit under a heap of dirty newspaper, still untouched. Thankfully I eventually worked up the self-esteem to ditch him.
What is a tradition that everyone follows that you just don't see the point in?	Gay pride, black pride, Latino pride, white pride, American pride, etc. Seriously, you should be proud of the things you accomplish in life, not something that is a result of your genetics that you had no control over. And I feel that the only ones who should be proud to be an American are either the people willing to die for their country or people that have consciously decided to move here. By all means, celebrate the accomplishments that you have made as a member of your group of like-minded individuals, but don't be proud of your genetics or something that is an accident of birth.	I'm Dutch and it's a tradition here that when you arrive at someone's birthday, you congratulate everyone there, not just the birthday boy or girl. It seems so pointless to me to congratulate the sister of my friends' sisters boyfriend with my friends birthday.
Is this how brexit felt?	No. Brexit happened because of very low voter turnout by people who didn't want to leave the EU. In the USA, this is happening because there is a surprise turn-out of people who are actively rejecting the norm. This is a massive pushback against the Liberal Left taking it too far.	Read this on a thread about brexit a few months ago.. and it fits the current situation perfectly -- > You can't feed a society exaggeration, hyperbole and propaganda for over a decade, and then claim surprise when people don't seem to be making rational decisions on the basis of well established truth. > There's a cost associated with not telling the truth. There's a cost associated with polarized, adversarial public discourse. There's a cost associated with media more concerned with profits than the public interest. > It is, apparently, time to pay the piper. - u/allmhuran
Do you know someone who got fired on their first day? What did they do?	Not me but my dad hiring in Tallahassee, Florida (we are from New Zealand). Guy ticked all the boxes except one, he was black. Didn't see that as an issue, but his boss did and advised against it. Saying that he would fire anyone that was racist towards him, he went ahead and hired him. First day in the office, and this guy was, and I quote, "the most racist motherfucker I have ever met". He was out by 3.	I worked at a gas station a while back. Helped train this new guy. He was really nice, we all liked him. 1st solo shift he walks away with $150 out of the register. Didn't even try to cover it up or anything. Everybody was shocked. Wtf did he think was gonna happen?
[Serious]Those who have lived/worked out on the ocean for long periods of time: What's the creepiest thing that ever happened to you while out at sea?	Being depth charged off the coast of(with held for security reasons) the submarine took a close one to the port side and caused the sub to tilt which scammed the reactor. We are dead in the water and need to get propulsion back or another depth charge could take us out. It is so dark in a sub when the lights go out. Everyone did their job and got power and propulsion back. We got out of there only to find out later we were where we were not supposed to be and up to no good but I can say the real Navy SEALs did their job that day and thwarted future terrorist actions.	I'm ex-Navy. Was cruising at night in the Indian Ocean in big-ish seas (stars were out but the water was rough because of a distant storm) and no moon. I was on the stern having a smoke (this was the 90s). Guy commits suicide by making a solid run to aft and jumping off the fantail into the dark. We called man overboard and I saw the guy's head bobbing in the waves for a few minutes but we lost him in the dark during the turn. In his jump he cleared the screws. We could've saved him if we could see him. They deployed motor whaleboats and stayed in the area for awhile looking for him. It was creepy (for me) because I saw a man die in the worst way I could imagine: Wet, lonely, and in the dark.
[Serious] Redditors who went from being able bodied to suddenly disabled, when did life start to feel normal again?	I was hospitalized due to anxiety and depression last year. My parents told me that I just need to "stop being sad" or I should "get a job". They don't understand my pain. I look at burn victims, people who are paralyzed down the neck and rape victims with envy, as even they wont know my suffering.	My level of injury is considered very high (c4). After 5 years (in February) I am still piecing my life together. I led a very active lifestyle so for me to get my life back to a close resemblance I knew that it would take a few years. Come December I am buying a hand cycle to enjoy biking trails around my house so that will be fun. Edit: I guess I should have pointed out c4 is my neck
What was normal in your home growing up but now you realize was odd?	We always ate dinner.....gulp...I can't believe I'm saying this. At the dinner table. There!!! I said it. It's out there.	My brother and I always stayed up much later than our peers but I didn't realize that until high school. Our parents own a restaurant so it was common for my dad to get home around ten or eleven; we'd stay awake until then, say hi, watch some tv and head to bed around midnight. Never really had an enforced bedtime...not sure what time parents generally send kids to bed now, to be honest.
Russian Redditors, What opinions do politicians and media in Russia portray of America?	Nyet, I can't speak. Mama would be much disappoint if I insulted our great proletarian leaders. Can't we just have vodka comrade, instead of insulting fellow gopniks.	Traditionally Americans are viewed as an aggressive and malicious nation. However, the younger generation don't really believe it at this point.
US residents of Reddit: How will the repeal of the Affordable Care Act affect you...positively or negatively?	My insurance and medical costs will go up at least 1,000$ a year, probably more. I may have to avoid getting diagnosed with illnesses I know I have because I can't afford the medication. Fuck trump.	As someone diagnosed at the age of 17 with type 1 Diabetes, the preexisting condition applies to my multiple insulin pens and supplies. Paying for insulin without the coverage will be upwards of $600 dollars every month; it may force me to decide between attending college or staying alive.
What popular-on-reddit thing do you not like?	Pretty much all things that come from tumblr. Alpha-Beta, All this SJW shit. I'm here for foodporn, porn, funny stories, news, highlights of 4chan, video game forums, and dank memes. I don't care about *you*, I don't care about what -kin you are, I don't care about your SJW acts, what race you are, if you're a girl/boy, I don't care about your political opinions, your religion, or what you think is right or wrong. So next time you go on a tangent about something remember this. Nobody cares about you, we want memes. I JUST WANT DANK MEMES	Jumping on any post by some poor asshole who forgot a serious tag and spamming it with a bunch of stupid outrageous stories and then admonishing OP for not including a serious tag.
People who grew up in states that still celebrate the Confederacy's history, how is the Civil War taught in schools?	GA, we learned it the same way everyone else does. South was agricultural and started to lose influence in the economic sphere as the north started to heavily industrialize which allowed greater population density and voting power. Once Lincoln was elected they basically had all but decided to leave because they knew they were never going to hold power again. The slavery issue was largely a wedge issue which was used as a proxy for much of the economic anxiety in the country and was effective at motivating an otherwise reluctant north to back war efforts and galvanize the south around a set of issues when many on both sides didn’t really give a shit about slavery one way or another.	VA here. We were taught that slavery was a horrible part of our history, but that slavery was not the only issue leading up to the civil war.
What is a little interesting fact that not many people know about?	The north pole is actually The south pole. But we say it's The north because on The compass The arrow With The N on is pointed north. But south attracts north on a magnet.	If the Solar System were shrunk to the size of a standard quarter coin, the Milky Way would be the size of the continental US.
Why do people get more upset about abuse to animals than they do abuse to humans?	I mean, if a guy is being tortured their is probably a reason for it. What can a cat do that deserves to be tortured for?	A lot of people think that animals are defenseless and innocent, mostly due to their size and complete trust of humans. They have the same feelings towards children. Whereas a human man or woman could reasonably defend themselves, a child or a small domestic animal cannot. It's interesting to note that studies have shown similar things about horror films. Most audiences draw the line at child, animal, or elder abuse. As such, a lot of the horror films that you see (especially disaster films) will not feature these groups. Cloverfield sticks out in my mind as one that was particularly affected by this.
What part of Reddit culture annoys you?	How completely liberal it is. It is the dumping ground of every rainbow haired she-twink on the internet, that constantly polices and destroys free thought under a the premise of "racism" As if anyone has ever died of reading something "racist" Plus how it forces more left leaning subs to auto subscribe like twoxchromosomes and news. It tries to create methods of getting around popular right leaning subs and keep them off the front page. Bottom line its a barely functional circle jerk of cat pictures and "today I learned (insert completely mundane and widely known thing here) mixed in with angry bulldykes policing the internet for anything that might make them queef with rage.	"Experts". I'm an airline pilot and people are constantly "correcting" me on what it's like to be a pilot. The funny thing is that they usually word it better than me and get people to downvote my post.
"Essays are like skirts; they should be long enough to cover what's important, but short enough to still be interesting." What's the funniest analogy you've ever heard?	girls and boys are like locks and keys a lock that is opened by many keys is a shitty lock but a key that opens many locks is an awesome key	"Like a midget at a urinal, I was going to have to stay on my toes." from Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult.
What did you want to become when you were a kid that seems really stupid right now?	I know that if my generation had gotten their way there'd be a helluva lot of marine biologists floating around. Of course when I was 7 I thought all they did was walk into the ocean and play with seals and dolphins all day.	A blacksmith. I was REALLY fond of "save-the-princess-from-the-dragon"-type of stories. At the same time, however, I found dragons to be terrifying. So I thought, fuck it, I can't fight it, so I'll do my part by making the blade that slays the beast. I just now realize how much of a bad idea that was. I still have the same crappy hand-eye coordination from back then.
Taxi Drivers of reddit: Have you ever actually been asked to "follow that car"?	Yes but only in a friendly manor. I once had a shit box Caprice pull up next to me and ask me "how do we get to xyz st. " I said " I am not telling you that" One of the guys goes "Why not" All incredulous. I say " Cuz you are welfare fraud investigators and I know someone who lives on that street" They are both shocked and ask how I knew what they were " You are obviously cops just by how you look and you are in a state owned vehicle that is probably the worst one the state has and you are going to a street in the projects so.. you are welfare fraud. Good luck!" and I drove off.	Almost, sort-of. When I drove cab, I had a fare jump in at the downtown bus terminal and ask me to "follow that dog" meaning the Greyhound bus. Good paying trip! I also had a fare ask me to follow a woman who was walking down the sidewalk, though I refused that fare.
What's the weirdest first date you ever had?	I once went on a date with this girl I'd known from college and right in the middle of eating she ripped this huge fart and said "deal with it" the table behind us (a family of like..eight) just starred at us rudely the rest of the time and the fart smelled really bad. She did this two more times throughout the evening	Showed up for internet based date. She shows up with a dude. Expected me to pay for them both to eat and drink for the evening. WTF?
Have you ever received a christmas present that made you burst into tears?	Yeah, this one time I was REALLY really poor for Christmas, but I really wanted to get something for the wife anyway. So I had this old watch that I pawned off for just enough money to buy a bunch of hair care shit for the mrs. Go home and give it to her only to find out that she had shaved off all her hair so that she could buy me a chain for my watch. So we were both stuck with gifts we couldn't use. That was a shit Christmas, but at least I wrote a book about it later that did pretty good.	My mom got me a book about some long dead coal towns in Southwest Virginia. I was very perplexed until I figured out that it had images of my dead father as a child along with the rest of his family in it. I cried like a baby.
What is the weirdest thing that made you cry?	Prom episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer when Oz showed up in his tux. I was really, really obsessed with Seth Green at the time and was overwhelmed by his hotness and the futility of my love.	I watched a morbidly obese man belt out "Proud to be an American" completely off key at a Veteran's Day assembly when I was in 3rd grade. I thought it was the most beautiful performance ever.
How did your friend group fall apart?	I had a kid. When every social gathering is loosely centered around Drinking it’s hard to stay part of it when pregnant or with a newborn. Plenty of days where even if I had a baby sitter I’d rather sleep than drink.	University ended and we all moved to different places. Another one we all ended up leaving the job around the same time and the group didn't hold without work to tie us together even though previously we had socialised outside of work a lot.
What are the coolest "1 in a million" chances you've witnessed?	I saw a bald eagle grab a fish from a lake. Literally, the most amazing thing I think I have ever seen. Then again... The massive turd one of those things managed to drop on my dads truck... god damn... Honestly, the window should have cracked.	I was young. Probably around 10. I'd just learned that I could flick/throw my library card like a frisbee. Ecstatic with my newfound power, I walked into my room and immediately flicked it into the far corner, hitting a window. Upon inspecting the card, I discovered I had accidentally bisected a fly with my library card. Guts on the card. Guts on the window where it hit. That is still my life achievement.
What is a red flag that you ignored because you didn't want it to be true?	Overly out going and friendly. Great to hang out with as a friend(get to do new things)... she will cheat on you	Not that I didn't want it to be true, I just didn't really think about it. Years ago I made a joke about my SO's family having a 'lemming gene' because they're seriously crazy accident prone. His brother was irate, thinking Id accused him of being suicidal. At the time I thought he was just defensive because he'd been struggling with depression, we didn't delve into it any further. He killed himself a week ago.
How do you disagree with someone without being a dick?	"Thank you for voicing your opinion. however, i want it to be known that i disagree with this opinion that you currently hold"	Don't be a dick about it. "I disagree" and your reason why would be fine for any rational adult. If the simple fact that you disagree with someone is enough for them to think you're a dick, that's on them and their delicate ego.
What did you do as a kid that made you a huge pain in the ass?	I was a button pusher. Tried to make people mad, see what kind of reactions I could get out of them. Actually, I still do that..	-I would hide my Mother's cigarettes or break them. Once I put them all filter side down in a potted plant. -Every time I broke something in the house I assembled it the best I could to make it seem like the next person who touched it broke it. -I refused to eat anything with onions.
What novel is criminally overrated?	Anything by Jane Austen....just British upper class chick lit. It has the same redeeming value as Sex and the City. It's pop culture. Not literature.	The Fault in Our Stars. I read other books by Green, and in their own right, were much better than TFIOS. I got bored within the first 10 pages. Call me insensitive but it is what it is.
What are some DOs and DON'Ts for aliens trying to invade Earth?	Don't be a hero and fight against the aliens. Think about it. If they have the technologies to travel to Earth. Then they can easily vaporize you. Think of the Europeans with ships and guns who encountered the natives of North America. Not only did the bacteria carried by the foreigner nearly wiped out the indigenous, bows and arrows were no match for guns (range battles).	Always remember that just because you're an alien doesn't mean you're exempt from the rule about invading Russia in the winter.
Has a friend ever done something that made you decide to drop them from your life? Did you tell them or just stop talking to them?	She asked my husband to be a sperm donor so she could get pregnant with her lesbian partner. After that, I just simply stopped returning her calls. When we moved to a new house, I didn't give her the number. Haven't heard from her in years. Thank goodness.	One old friend threw my puppy into my stove, not inside, but into the glass. He thought it was hilarious, I just stopped answering his calls.
Guys of Reddit, what is something girls think you don't notice, but you actually do notice?	That they are beautiful, interesting, and worth some respect Sadly (and ironically) they won't hear that because this post will be buried under 500 shallow, meaningless, and completely irrelevant criticisms.	When you walk past a guy you like and you're not sure where to look, so you just stare straight ahead like a robot.
Redditors who quit using a social media site like facebook or twitter, what was your final straw?	I fully deleted my facebook a few months back. Short of it: I was called a racist for offering a different narrative of the situation in McKinley, Texas where a police officer slammed a 14 year old girl to the ground. Since part of my profile included the company I work for, I opted for noping the fuck out rather than crawling down the hole with retorts.	I quit using Facebook when I realized that it was nothing but drama and a popularity contest. It was getting depressing so I finally just got rid of the whole thing.
Redditors who've scammed someone else, what's your story?	Before people became more tech-savvy, I would fix up old broken computers and sell them for more than expected. I would just make sure it had the latest version of windows and include a decent keyboard or mouse.	I had a small candy market back in middle school. I would go to places that sold cheap candy and bought the most popular ones. I would then take the bags of candy and separate them into specific amounts to be sold (10 pieces, 15 pieces, 25 pieces etc.). Pop rocks was a crowd favorite and I would generally have more of those than anything else. I then take my bags of goods and sell them to students around break time (not lunch time because I didn't want to attract attention). I made a small fortune selling these pieces of candies especially when you can buy these bags in bulk. A good day would net me three to four times the amount of I paid for and others only two. I always made my money back so I was never in danger of losing money.
Redditors who remarried after a partner's death, if the partner were to come back, who would you choose and why?	Your next post should be: "Redditors who've lost one of their children, if you could sacrifice one of your other children to get the deceased one back, which one would it be and why?" Honestly, what kind of question is this?	I don't think I can choose. My late wife was absolutely perfect for me. So is my current wife. I'm also a very different person than a long time ago--my late wife would have liked me even more now but I don't know that I would have changed for the better if I hadn't met my current wife. This is a great question and I've asked it many times myself. What I've determined is I can't dwell on the past because that way lies depression and I've had enough of that.
Hairdressers of Reddit, what was your grossest experience?	Really bad psoriasis on clients. When you're combing their hair after a shampoo and patches of skin with hair still attached just fall off of their scalp. It's like a zombie. No joke.	My mom cut hair before she had me. She told me she had this lady with a perm come in for a trim and shampoo and as she was shampooing her, little bugs fell into the sink. Turns out my mom just stuck her hands into a whole perm full of lice and the lady didn't even know she had it. The lady left before she could get cut and my mom disinfected everything.
Redditors that work at 24hr establishments: What's the oddest thing that's happened in the 'off' hours? Say 12am-5am?	I used to work at this pizza place as a security guard. Even though they didn't serve food there 24/7 they still felt the need to have a security guard on overnight. Red flag number one. The first few hours were pretty relaxing, but as the night crawled on the security cameras slowly lost power, and I started to hear strange noises. I wasn't too worried though, because by this point I only had to last a couple more hours for my shift to be over, and who would want to cause trouble at the equivalent of a chuck e cheese. Near the end of my shift it happened. Lights flickered, doors burst open, and I was stuffed into a giant animatronic suit filled with wires and steel girders.	A while ago I had a friend who would work overnight at a walmart in my city. Every night around 3-4 am some random guy dressed like michael jackson would start moonwalking from aisle to aisle. I'm not fucking around he took several videos of it. My friend got freaked out by this when he saw it and told some of his co-workers and they just laughed and said "oh yeah, that's just MJ." Edit: Isle to Aisle Thanks refinnej78
What did you promise yourself you wouldn't do, but ended up doing anyway?	Poop my pants. Everytime I do it I swear it'll be the last time. But after a trip to Taco Bell.....well needless to say I need new pants	I'm on Reddit right now. I have important shit to do right now. I'll let you draw your own conclusions from that.
Teens (and recent teens of reddit) how do I deal with the porn issue with my son?	use opendns.. it is free and you can filter what your child can access. If you need help setting up feel free to pm me.	The only thing you should do is let him know you're there for him if he has any questions, and to know porn is not a guide to good sex for both parties
What's your physical attribute that you are most grateful for?	My muscle tone. I'm 5'11 and 130 pounds, so I could have easily ended up being one of the scrawniest-looking people on the planet. But I have pretty great muscle tone, so I actually look pretty cut rather than just like a skeleton.	People say I have an innocent face. This gas station clerk straight up told me "you don't look like the criminal type." I'm Black and I live in the South.
Whats a good way to kill time in an Airport?	My sons once posed in front of one of those rotating boards with different adverts - each time a new one came round they would do an action, dance or song to go with it.	My favorite is when I am waiting at the gate. Looking around, I start to size people up and assign them roles that they will play in the event of our plane crashing on a mysterious island. If we are forced to create a mini-society to survive, who will be of value? What can everyone contribute? Who will be villainous? Before I board, I try to get the main archetypes filled up. Also, when I am walking down the aisle to be seated, if I remember a face, I will remember the section of plane, just in case it breaks apart and lands on a different end of the island...
What is the best live concert you've ever been to?	I've only been to two, hah. But Beach House. Victoria Legrand is amazingly perfect live. She sounds just like she does on the albums.	Weird Al. He wears costumes, is chipper, shows funny video clips (usually of himself on The Simpsons) in between songs, and I think he tossed out a bunch of money during "I'll Sue Ya"...
Lesbian couple in my kid's school community want us to cancel the "Father Daughter" dance on grounds of discrimination. What should we do?	Screw them, it's just a dance. I don't go into a women's shelter and bitch about how it's unfair that men can't go in.	They're making a big deal about it. We never had a father, so I took my sister to her father/daughter dance. I was a teenage boy at the time. If a teenage boy can take his sister to a father/daughter dance, then a grown adult should have no issues.
Catalans of Reddit, what's it like over there right now?	This rando my roommate invited won't trade me one fucking sheep for three wheat. Doesn't he know no wheat = defeat??? Great deal for him goddamn	I'm not Catalan but I live in Barcelona. All quiet round my neighbourhood. There were a few banging saucepans when the declaration happened, and a few fireworks. After that, nothing. I'm surprised. But all the action will be in the center of the city.
Is it possible to donate your testicles? If the person who received the testicle has a baby. Would that baby have the donors genes?	No, it's not, but fun fact: When men lose a testicle, to cancer or trauma or whatever, they can have a prosthetic testicle (sometimes called a Neuticle) implanted to preserve the look of two balls in a sac. This came from show dogs (maybe also show cats? or I'd just like to think so) to keep them looking intact and avoid distracting the judges after the dog was neutered. Also, when a human man with a Neuticle gets cremated, everything burns except the little ball, clinking around amongst the ashes. (Edited for rogue punctuation)	Biomed student here. Testicular transplant is not routinely performed at this time. The reasons? There are safe, non-invasive alternatives for the two key products of the testicle, i.e. sperm donation and testosterone replacement. Also, any transplanted organ (except between identical twins) will tend to be rejected by the body and requires you to be on immunosuppression for life, which is usually thought to not be worth it for a testicle. However, ignoring all that for a second, we come to the second point. Let's assume all the following conditions are met: you manage to convince a hospital to perform a testicle transplant, it works, and the recipient doesn't produce any sperm from his other testicle, and he manages to help conceive a baby. In that case, the baby would indeed have been created with donor DNA.
What is the shittiest thing you did as a kid?	Not really a child, but when I was 14 I began watching Dateline's 'to catch a predator.' I was intrigued by how easy it was for them, so I decided to test it. I went on chat rooms and masqueraded as an 11 year old girl. Eventually a man in his mid 50's began talking, and I carried on the most filthy, disgusting chat for a few hours. The guy was an idiot, he told me his full name so I Facebook search him, and boom, his account is open. When I checked a little deeper, I saw that he had a wife and 2 daughters. I sent the entire transcript to his wife via Facebook message and that was that.	Neighbors were building their house and had just poured the driveway. Little me found out that I could make really cool designs in the wet concrete by riding my bike through it. My parents and neighbors seemed to disagree.
[Serious]Are there any societies that developed without ANY religion?	Religion was the justification to create society. This is why I believe religion to be an evolutionary hurdle that other species who reach our level of intelligence will have to jump over. If we define intelligence as advanced pattern recognition then any intelligent enough species will notice how orderly nature appears, as if something like themselves created it. They'll form their own gods, see that god is an idea that can't be disproved, learn how much power comes with such an idea, have wars over whose idea is correct, and either move past religion or kill themselves off because of it. So to answer your question, no. Religion has been with us since we first thought of it.	As far as we can tell from History No. There were some that tried to remove religion to govern but it was not really successful. The problem is religion seems to fill this need for Humans to believe in something. This is why Ideologies are not to dissimilar from religions.
Current/Former Biker gang members of Reddit, what are these gangs actually like?	I'm a founding member of a M/C club in Chicago. Bikers have their own life style, their own code, their own do's and don'ts. What is it you want to know?	My band got hired to play for the Molochs at a rented rodeo stadium/mixed use facility. We didn’t have to pay to get in, we got paid, people were nice and friendly, we played well, and my god do they party. I’ve never seen anything like it. 30-70 year olds going 100% on liquor, speed, weed, pills, strippers, all night long. They partied me under the table, and the next morning they made us pancake breakfast, and the cook was smoking a j as long as a pencil. They were riding around the rodeo grounds like maniacs, a lot of the girls riding behind were going topless no helmets anywhere to be seen and it was just apparently what they do. It was called the ‘Balls out Run’.
What is the "If it doesn't scan then that means it's free, right?" of your profession?	I work for a cell phone carrier. The best way to get ZERO legitimate help from a sales rep is to start your conversation with "hi, I've been a customer for X years....." We don't care. It doesn't matter. Ever.	I run a farmer's market. So mine would be customer: How much is this basket of tomatoes? farmer: $4 customer: Oh. Well how much is it if I come back at the end of the market and it's leftover? farmer: $6. (Actual overheard conversation from one of my very favorite farmers.)
How do you tell if someone is just being nice or flirting?	No one is being nice without having an ulterior motive in this day and age. I'd rather be yelled at than being suckered into something horrible because the said person was being nice to me.	Flirt back. If their flirting increases in frequency or intensity, they were flirting. If they pull back, they were just being nice. Stop your flirting, and it's all good.
Prison guards of reddit what's the most interesting/astonishing thing you have found while searching a cell?	I’m not here to answer this question. I’m just here to say that you should really put a [SERIOUS] tag on this type of question.	We were doing a full wing search and finding all sorts mobiles, weapons and drugs the standard. Got to a cell and this lad had a extra mattress, now nobody else on the wing was missing a mattress and this cell was directly in front of the wing office. So how the hell did he get this mattress on to the wing and in his cell with nobody noticing and he refused to say, still annoys me years later.
What's the smoothest way you've diffused an awkward situation?	My friend got drunk and punched the manager/bouncer of the bar in the face, then goes after the cop outside. She ends up on the ground in handcuffs. I flirted with the cop and convinced him to release her. The manager decided not to press charges.	When I was in my mid twenties I did consulting work in Manhattan with a bunch of guys of similar ages. Every Thursday we would go out drinking with our bosses (who were probably early thirties) on the company tab. One time about twenty of us were in a crowded bar and these two guys next to us kept bumping into my boss hard. He ignored the first couple times and bummed a cigarette from me. They slammed into him again and he yelled at them, they started jawing back and forth, etc. I wasn't really paying attention but saw my boss with the unlit cigarette in his mouth kind of staring down the guy. Without really thinking I leaned in to light the cigarette and it finally dawned on the strangers that there were twenty of us and two of them. Suddenly they became very apologetic.
You and a super intelligent snail both get 1 million dollars, and you both become immortal, however you die if the snail touches you. It always knows where you are and slowly crawls toward you. What's your plan?	Smash it with a hammer. Salt the Earth. Live on a Yacht. Give someone $5 to kill it. Basically spend 30 seconds deciding on what way I want to handle it and never let it worry me again. Tard level 10 on this question.	Pay another snail to seduce it and pretend to fall in love with it for exactly 6 months. During that time, they should have awesome sex every night. Once 6 months have passed, and my paid snail has left, the snail will be heartbroken, and wouldn't want to get out of his room ever. It might even become a drunkard, and waste away its immortality.
Have any of you actually been to a wedding where someone objected to the bride and groom being married? What happened?	It wasn't an objection during the ceremony, but the father of a good friend who I had dated a few years earlier confided to me during her wedding reception that he wished she had married me instead.	I should use a throwaway, but screw it, I've already done an AMA revolving around the subject: I married my brother's ex. There was an objection at my wedding as a direct result of that. My mother has since apologized for doing so.
What porn scene caused to you to close your laptop and not finish?	The porn starts, and it's already pretty intense. You've got that view from the back, slightly off on an angle, of a girl going down on another girl. All good, until I see that the one who's gone down, actually has balls. It was a fucking shemale.	Didn't close the Laptop but I was watching this real cute redhead masturbating and this shit was really well put together, 1080p, very sensual lighting ect. Anyways I'm jacking it because this was the best solo video I've ever seen...till she pulls an egg out of fucking nowhere and cracks it open on her pussy and carries on like nothing happened. Literally the funniest thing I have seen to date. It's on pornhub somewhere, if anyone can link me that'd be great.
What’s the strangest conversation that you’ve ever overheard?	Once heard my neighbor my freshman year of college talking on the phone to someone about wanting to sell her eggs (as in the ones in her uterus) to help pay for her boyfriends legal troubles. Alright girlie, you do you. I figure she’s talking to one of her girlfriends or something, right? Then I hear “alright, I gotta go do homework. Talk to you later Grandma!” 😳 WHAT 😂 Like I’m super close with my grandma don’t get me wrong, she’s my favorite person on this planet, I just thought that was an odd topic of conversation to have with good ol’ Granny.	On a plane, sitting near a traveling baseball team of boys about 14-16ish. “No dude, you don’t understand, he’s like the best chinchilla breeder *in the country*!”
Reddit, what is your driving tip?	The tip of My Penis. I drive my car with my Penis on the wheel. It's very used to fine controls and is more reliable than using my hands.	Assume that everyone on the road are inexperienced drivers that don't know how to drive properly. This might save your life (talking from personal experience)
Haunted trail/house workers of Reddit, what's the craziest thing you've seen/heard on the job?	I've worked in one before my best story comes from walking through one with a girl I was seeing at the time. We enter this haunted house and the first person we see is Michael Meyers. He is slowly walking behind us and then throughout the house he would appear in random places that would shock you because you think there is no way he could get there that fast. Obviously, there was more than one actor playing the character. So after he is creeping up on us after the stairs, we turn the corner and he pops through a window and somehow punches the girl I was with square in the face. Damn near knocked her down. He immediately broke character and worryingly appologized. I jokingly said, "It's alright man, you saved me the trouble of having to do it." He laughed, she didn't.	I worked a haunted house in college. I was one of the people who hid behind things and jumped out right after the lights came on, so people were lightblind and startled. This one time a kid was walking through with his mom, and I heard him whisper someting. She said "Okay sweetie" and just... fucking... took his pants and underwear off in the middle of his mazelike warehouse haunted house and dropped them in a corner. Pulled out another pair and helped him put it on. Continued along the path, leaving the pants in the corner. He shit his pants and she just left them there....
After months of applying for jobs, interviewing, and not being hired anywhere else, I finally broke down and got a job at McDonalds. I start tomorrow. Employees of McDonalds, how bad is it?	What exactly is wrong with working at McDonald's? So let me get this straight. You're 19. I'm assuming you're a high school graduate, without a college degree. You have at most three years of work experience under your belt, which is the bare minimum required in the professional world. And you expect to get hired at a workplace other than retail or the food service industry? It's self-entitled people like you that makes Americans look snobby and lazy.	I work at Mcdonalds, and worked my way up to a swing manager. In all honesty, it's what you make of it. If you go in thinking its going to suck, then, it will suck. Get in there with a good attitude, ignore the drama/stupid employees, and find the nice ones and make friends. It's really like any other job. In the end, it is what *you* make of it. Good luck to you, man!
911 operators of Reddit, what’s the strangest, serious emergency you’ve heard?	I got a call saying 'THIS IS A SERIOUS EMERGENCY SEND AN AMBULANCE' 'Sir what is the emergency?' 'ITS SERIOUS SEND A DAMN AMBULANCE' 'Sir you're going to have to tell me what's wrong and where you are.' 'It's gone oh god it's gone. You've gotta send someone it's gone.' 'What's gone!? Is there and animal loose sir? Is anyone hurt?' 'It's gone, and it's serious, and he's going to regret it.' 'Wait what? What's gone and who's going to regret what?' 'It's missing. The Serious Tag.'	I answered the phone and gave my usual, "911, do you need Police, Fire, or Ambulance? " and the person on the other end just started screaming, "BEEEEEEEEEEEEES!! BEEEEEEES!!" I assumed that the bees were neither mugging him nor on fire, so I put it through to ambulance because what the fuck even.
What is a weird habit of yours?	I shout aloud to my dog how much of an evil beast it is and how it should be rid of the world (he's a pitbull). I then go over and strangle him lightly and insult him further. He lies there comatose confused.	When I put deodorant on in the morning, I apply to one pit, throw the deodorant in the air so it does a perfect flip and lads in my other hand, and apply to the other pit. If I miss the catch, I start over
What's a 100% true story from your life that's so ridiculous it seems fake?	My little brother chased me around the house when I was 5ish and he was 4 with my dads gun so out of pure panic I had to kill him with a kitchen knife, is it bad that I miss him?( it took about 1~ years for the police to close the case as an accident	Got a call on my office phone on my first day of work. Lady wants to set up a time to meet and gives me complex directions. I assumed it was work training. I follow the directions and end up waaay outside of town in a rural nowhere. Turns out they were trying to sell a trailer and called the wrong number.
[Serious] Women, what are common ways unfamiliar men make you uncomfortable or creeped out?	Honestly? If I'm out in public, like in line, or something, don't try to strike up a conversation with me out of nowhere. I just want to be left alone. Your commentary is not necessary. If you do this, and I don't respond in a friendly way, then just drop it. Don't try to continue a conversation with someone who doesn't want to have one. EDIT: All the niceguys who don't want to change their behavior to make people around them more comfortable are here to remind me that they're nice and shouldn't have to change. Why did I expect any different on reddit?	I'm not sure how common this is, but when I took my car in to my dealership for my service, I gave my keys to the mechanic and went inside to wait without saying anything to him. Late that day, I got a friend request on social media. He had apparantly taken my professional car file to figure out who I was and find me. This file also has my address and phone, so I was pretty worried and creeped out. I also used to have a boss who only hired women and took their addresses off their resumes to follow them to their homes and hit on them. Addresses on resumes aren't as useful anymore. I wouldn't recommend putting it on there.
What's the weirdest misconception your parents have ever had?	When I was born, my parents thought I was half snake. I was born without arms and legs but I was blessed with totally hairless skin and a really long tongue. Thankfully I never really had to experience life like that, or atleast I don't remember it, because when I was almost one years old I was given growth hormones to stimulate the growth of my arms and legs. But yeah, looking back at pictures, I really did look snake-like so you can't blame my parents for thinking that.	Back when I lived with my parents they saw what looked like a condom packet in my wallet. For some reason the family took great pride in it. It was in fact a Twinnings tea bag I keep for when I want a cup of tea.
What common misconception deeply upsets you?	The misconception that liberal arts fields like English and History are not scientific. In a true academic setting, these subjects are often times better examples of the most important skills like evidence gathering and argument formulation. But the push for STEM, as justified as it is, pushes forth the 'attractive' fields of science like engineering and chemistry and pulls away funding from the liberal arts programs which holistically develop a child.	That turbulence on aeroplanes is really dangerous and can bring down a plane. Turbulence on aeroplanes virtually *never* means you're going to crash. But everyone always gets all worried about it. I was on a flight once and everyone around me got panicked by turbulence and went into the brace position for no reason. They just ended up donking their heads on the seat in front when the plane was buffeted. Then applauded the captain when we landed (no crosswind or anything) an hour later, and an hour after the turbulence subsided. They all thought they narrowly cheated death. Ugh.
What’s your hobby that most people don’t realise is ‘a thing’?	Gaming. Where I’m from very few people see it as a hobby and mostly it’s seen as “a kids thing”	Miniature painting. My ex was wary of telling people because he said he’d get all sort of stupid responses. I really don’t know why; I think it takes skill and patience and the results can be very satisfying.
How did you take the first step to asking your SO out?	It was a five year courtship that she knew nothing about. First step was into her back yard at night.	I waited an extra hour after an exam for her to finish just so I could go ask her to coffee. Together for 10 years married for 5, 1 month old daughter.
What is something that was once considered to be a "legend" or "myth" that eventually turned out to be true?	Donald trump colluding with putin to undermine American democracy and destabilize the free world to pay off debts he owes.	It wasn't clear whether King Richard III was really deformed, or if people who wrote about him after he died were just making it up. Some people thought he must have been physically normal, but writers added the deformity to make him seem more hateable. When his remains were found, there was evidence of severe scoliosis that would have made one shoulder higher than the other. Not a hunchback, but at least a bit lopsided.
What skills have you worked hard to acquire which time and technological progress have rendered obsolete? What skills will become obsolete in the future?	I'm a pretty good story teller in a world where story means less and less. In the future the written word will be only something hipsters sit down and read.	Doing math by hand. Also, I work in a biology lab and techniques get outdated and replaced at a pretty high rate.
What "fee" is 100% a cash grab/extortion that companies are charging?	Idk about the rest of you but the Pizza Hut by me has a delivery fee, a minimum delivery price, and on top of that they are finicky on tipping. Even to the point of giving me incorrect change and me havin to pull out the calculator on my phone.	When a retail store charges me for a debit transaction - I'm already paying bank fees to cover my side of the debit transaction. Seriously, accept the cost of doing business or move on. It really grinds my gears.
If there were a show called Moderately Uncomfortable Factor (instead of Fear Factor), what would be some of the tasks or stunts?	Listening to my ex-girlfriend drone on for hours about all of the minutia that happened during her day and how each and everything made her feel. Bonus points if you have to actually feign interest.	Touching stuff after rubbing lotion on your hands but the lotion was never fully dissipated so theres still a thin film of it on your hands.
What's your weird first date story?	She looked nothing like her Tinder profile, and she had braces plus 50 extra pounds. Couldn't stay focused for more then 15 seconds.	My name is Andrea, his name was Sam. I though he was a girl, he thought I was a girl as well. Realised we were 2 dudes and said goodbye to each other. EDIT: Andrea being a male name is pretty common in Italy. I moved to the UK years ago hence the trouble. EDIT 2: I know it may sound strange to english native speaker but Andrea comes from the Greek ἀνδρός, which means 'Man' in particular referring to its masculinity. I met lots of people named Andrea during my life and most of them were women (living in UK and often travelling in the US / Asia) but yeah, that always sounded strange for me as well :)
What is the most bizarre reason a customer got angry with you?	I used to work at a mobile operator store. I was still a trainee, about a month into the job. We also sold lottery tickets. A man walks in and asks for a type of ticket, which was new, came out 1 or 2 days ago. I said "I'm sorry, we don't have them yet". Then he mumbles something that in english roughly translates to "F you, you liars/go F yourselves" and walks out very quickly. I am a sort of a hot headed person and my manager was always teaching me how to stay calm. He was there to stop me from going after the guy.	I was working at McDonald’s. A customer complained that there was not a tomato on her Big Mac. I explained to her that Big Macs do not come with tomatoes unless special ordered. She then proceeded to sing the Big Mac song to me in front of a lobby fulll of customers adding the word TOMATO into the song lyrics in an attempt to prove her point.
Reddit, what was your five minutes of fame?	So, here I am - 11th grade Target of bullying No big deal, they can suck it Gym class Hockey players, baseball players Fucking jocks, won't leave me alone Indoor wiffle ball time, left field Quick grounder straight to me, three on base, one out Rear back and *whoosh* - straight to home Third base didn't make it in time Every baseball player, "That was unfair! You have to throw it to [insert base here] first!" Demoralized and pissed, the next guy swings wild and hits a high one Easily caught That's right you team of neanderthal jocks, the bullied just beat you at your own game Fuckers The year after that, 12th grade, I nearly broke the school bullies nose. It wasn't a bad couple years overall. Not internet celebrity or anything, but damn if it didn't feel good.	A woman attempted to steal me from the hospital the day after I was born, she was busted trying to leave with me. It was ALL over the news for weeks. I have cassette tapes from 3 different news stations featuring the story and interviews with my mom. No one remembers now but it was quite the story 23 years ago. I recently gave birth in the same hospital. They have crazy security now. They took out the nursery and the entire maternity ward is on lockdown 24/7 and nurses follow all these strict guidelines.
What's your ghost/creepy/paranormal story?	I saw a man put his penis in a hotdog bun at a cart once. I think it was as a joke, but it was extremely inappropriate.	My great grandmother watched my great grandfather die. They were truly in love forever. After he died, she woke up every morning and said "damn it!" because she was ready to pass away. My great aunts would hear her talking on a baby monitor they set up talking to members of the family who had already passed. Finally one afternoon, they heard her go "John, finally! Why are you always late". They were frozen as John was my great grandfather's name. They walked in 10 minutes later and she passed away. She was just waiting for her husband to come get her.
Which jobs attract only a certain type of person?	Are you an abusive formal high school bully? Do you have an erection when you trample someone's constitutional rights? Are you ok with ruining the future of young men?? Come on down!! We are looking for candidates in the law enforcement industry.	I work as a bouncer and we basically only get two types of people. Wannabe cops with anger issues, and former felons with anger issues.
[Serious] people with any cancer. What were your first signs? Whst were your first thoughts about it?	This happened to a friends Mom. She had stomach pains for a week or so, went to the doc. They ran some tests and notices she had masses in her stomach. Did some more tests and realized that she had them on almost every organ in her stomach. Doctors gave her 3 months at first, the next week 2 months. She passed away after about a month. Spent her last week in hospice. It was about 3 months from initial doctors visit to her passing. It was awful. My friend lived with her. She was in her late 40's and had never set up a will. His father passed when he was young. He had to scramble to take care of her while trying to work and maintain his sanity.	Ocular Melanoma stage 1b. No symptoms other than a slight itch that I attributed to dry eye. Optometrist said he saw something "odd" but didn't get a bad vibe from it. Went and got it checked and they said it's a mole, come back if it changes. 18 months later my eyesight started getting worse, so went back to my optometrist. Now he said the odd thing looks bigger and he didn't like that so I should go get it checked again. Still no other symptoms. Went back to the ocular oncologist and his exact words were "Wow! It got a LOT bigger, now I need to figure out how to save your life". He had me in surgery that week for a biopsy and resection and then I had radiation treatments the following week. So far, so good.
How do 5 people control the fate of the internet for 300+ million people who disagree with them, in a supposed democracy?	Because we don't live under a democracy. We live under a democratic republic, and despite its drawbacks it is a good thing. Personal property and freedom of choice cannot exist in a pure democracy. It is essentially a slightly more civilized version of mob rule.	The US is not a democracy. It is a Federal Republic with democratically elected state and local representatives. Democracy is a method of reaching a consensus and not an efficient form of governance.
What does Reddit always blow out of proportion?	Atheism. Nobody gives a shit what religious beliefs you have. It seems like the people over at /r/atheism are the ones bringing it up in the conversation and get angry when not everyone agrees with them. FYI I am an atheist but I don't just bring it up in conversation out of the blue.	Being anti-sensationalized news. Reddit always complains about the evil mainstream media writing sensationalist news articles with clickbait titles but then sensationalizes the shit out of different news stories themselves.
Reddit: How do you find good music you've never heard before?	Pandora is really good, I've learned to love RHCP, Foo Fighters, Nirvana, Gorillaz, Oasis, etc all from putting in that I love The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd.	Try this website... www.gnoosic.com you put in three of your favorite bands/artists, and it will recommend similar stuff that you most likely haven't heard of, or listened to. (EDIT: to the creator(s) of gnoosic.com, I think we broke your site for a while there! Big apologies)
What are a few of your favorite things?	* Raindrops on roses * Whiskers on kittens * Bright copper kettles * Warm woollen mittens * Brown paper packages tied up with strings * Cream colored ponies * Crisp apple strudels * Doorbells * Sleigh bells * Schnitzel with noodles * Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings * Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes * Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes * Silver white winters that melt into springs These are a few of my favorite things	Airport hellos. A girl laughing at something funny you said and looking at you for a second longer than usual. That first beer when you're catching up with old friends. Walking out of the gym after a hard work out. Doing something nice for a stranger without any chance of seeing them again. Listening to your favourite song of the moment on the way home from work on a Friday.
What's your secret parenting trick that others might not approve of?	This is no secret, GIVE THE KIDS A SPANKING. No, don't beat your kids but don't tolerate misbehavior like my deadbeat sister or else you end up with 3 little shitheads for nephews	For context, I have AD/HD and was a very active/hyper kid who never wanted to go to sleep. For a few years when I was young (like..10 and under), when my dad would lay and read to/with me, he would tell me that whoever fell asleep first would win $0.25 from the other. I would win every single night, and the next morning I would ask him who won, and he would give me the money. I never made the connection. Looking back, he was a fucking genius. The near-insignificant amount of money he spent over the years got him a kid who who went to bed without a fight every single night.
How is your Saturday going?	good and bad i'm testing reddit's limits and no one likes it but on the other hand i've reaped quite a bit of karma so it balances out. i'm also hungover so there's that too.	I'm here in Albuquerque, New Mexico, it's 11:12am, and I'm about to head out with my 5-year old to buy him a new bicycle.
Reddit, if you could make a living being a criminal, how would you make your money?	Get a list of all grandparents with Alzheimer's and Dementia and call them and say it's their grandson Timmy and ask for credit card numbers to buy "toys" and other things kids like.	Grow my own weed, get a job as a janitor in high school and sell it to the students. They leave money in their lockers and give me the combination. After everyone's gone, I open their lockers, take the cash and leave their weed. I saw this method on a documentary called Trailer Park Boys and it seemed to have worked for Ricky.
I prevented a rape last night at a party, at my house... ever have a moment of heroism, and then realize it later?	Here's to you, ThatFreakSam, You are the hero we deserve. We won't hunt you, though. she's a silent guardian. A watchful protector. A Dark Knight.	So one night I am hanging out at my apartment, both roommates gone. Suddenly there is screaming and crying coming from the next apartment. I called the police, walked over there with my roomates golf club (thank god for college PE requirments). I walked out to see me neighbhor getting messed up by her boyfriend. The guy across the hall comes out and starts trying to pull him off, and gets punched in the face. The guy goes back towards the girl getting ready to hit her and I wacked him in the gut with the club and proceed to hit him a couple more times until my other neighbhor sits on him and the police come. A week later she stops by to say thank you, because apparently she had broken up with him and he really was going to kill her.
Conspiracy people of reddit,Why would a secret organisation want to remain secret, but have symbols and references everywhere revealing their existence?	Ever have an inside joke? Now imagine that with a cruel perverse sexual attitude with a hint of satanism. That's what gets these people off	Not a conspiracy theorist, but these things do exist, and it's for members to identify other members, or resources, without arousing suspicion to other people. It's showing up at a hotel, and asking which room is Bill W's conference. It's drawing a curved line in the sand, to see if anyone completes the pattern so you know who can trust (Jesus fish). Hanging your lantern outside a certain way to let runaway slaves know it's safe to rest here. Eventually, someone connects the dots. Word gets around, and people who shouldn't, start recognizing the symbols, and then the symbols change. Everyone knows, and can now identify the old symbols, and it just seems so obvious, without anyone knowing the new symbols. Suddenly the police are now questioning you because you haven't seen your GF molly in the club for a bit and started asking people if they saw her anywhere.
Doctors of Reddit, have you ever delivered a child that was obviously not the fathers? And if so, what was the fathers reaction?	I don't think "father" os the right word here. The baby being delivered is always the father's baby, just maybe not the present male's.	Both my parents are blood type O-, which is recesssive, I'm O+, the dominant trait (which neither could carry, it would manifest if they carried it). My mom passed away, so I can't be sure, but I'm carefully not asking questions (I'm very close to my dad). A funnier story involves a friend who moved here from Mexico. About 4 months after he moved, his gf back home told him she was pregnant. He marries her, she moves here. About 9 and a half months after he left Mexico, he goes to a doctor's appointment with her and asks when they are going to induce labor. The doctor gave him a condesending pat and explained that if the baby came now, she would have all sorts of problems, being 2 months premature and all. Whoops.
Redditors in their 20s-30s who still don't know "what they want to be when they grow up", What are you currently doing for work?	I'm not Muslim but I work at a mosque as a janitor. It's really made me love the Muslim people, the whole message they teach is wonderful and they always thank me for my work! Way better than my last middle school job.	Early thirties. I answer the phone in a contact centre. Still working on a Plan A. People often ask, "well, what do you *want* to do"... no idea. ... just something a bit more fun than this.
Teachers of Reddit: Have you ever had a student fall in love with you? What's your story?	I never had the hot teachers that seem to get hired on in high schools across the country these days. I think the only real issues have been guys in high school not shutting the f*%k up about something that should be a treasured memory for the rest of their life and bragging to friends about the experience. I would say that if high schools want to avoid teacher/ student relationships from occurring, stop hiring female teachers that look like a teen boy's wet dream.	Probably not what you are looking for, but I had a troubled student (latchkey kid at the age of 6, parents were trashy and neglectful) ask to call me "Mom." Shortly after that, I was his "girlfriend." Sometimes, he'd still switch back to calling me his mother. He had a lot of the teachers in the building believe it since he looked like a miniature version of me and nobody actually saw his real parents. Before the end of the class on the last day, he tearfully asked if I could adopt him. I would've in a heartbeat if I had been able to, but I was only 19 and a teacher's assistant.
People who have travelled to China, what is your "WTF China" story?	When I was in Shanghai in 1995, I would see women wearing pantyhose socks with their shoes. These were normal young office worker women dressed nicely..................except, they had calf high panyhose as socks. It definitely ruined everything...	I visited Shanghai, and I stumbled into the Marriage Market. Hundreds of elderly parents with flyers with photos and resumes of their unmarried adult children milling about, trying to arrange matches. It was like seeing the floor of a busy stock exchange.
What is your favourite animated TV series and why?	My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic. When we 4channers watched the pilot as a lark, we didn't expect to become fans. The show opens with a unicorn grad student, a skeptical nerd, discovering an ancient prophecy that's about to come true, and to save the world and her mentor, she and several other brave ponies set off into a dark forest. The humor is so sincere and heartwarming, not about cringe humor, offensiveness, or pop culture references, and it helped me move past my depression; and the philosophical underpinnings started curing my symptoms of autism and codependency. I wouldn't be as happy, healthy, or creative today if I hadn't started watching it. If I had to compare it to anything in terms of worldbuilding and the drama/comedy mix, it would be Disney Afternoon's Tale Spin.	Venture Bros. It may take years for each season to come out, but it's some of the funniest satire I've ever seen.
Why doesn't anybody make Super Saiyan costumes for cats?	Because as a general rule cats hate costumes and will try to get skin shredding vengeance on people who try to put them in costumes?	I'm upvoting this just because I want to see it on the front page. On another note, you might be a crazy person.
I just found out a group of grade 8 girls (and maybe a few boys) are doing a business giving blowjobs for $5 during lunch at my school. What other fucked up, "I don't want to live on this planet anymore" have occurred in your high schools?	Fellow classmates in my honors us history class in 11th grade had no idea what the civil war was -___________- People getting in fights Getting drunk/high to be "cool" Superficial orange skinned dumb cunts were considered, "popular" Some girl asked me if the lochness monster was real Another girl was sitting behind me in us history and we were talking about the banana republic. She blurts out, "That's a store!"-___- Pregnant people People who didn't use birth control Basically my whole high school made me want to not live on this planet anymore. One girl I grew up with had 20 partners by senior year, an abortion and a threesome with two black guys Majority of my senior class went to the shitty community college after high school Grinding at dances Showing up to dances drunk and they wouldn't get in trouble at all. So many more stories!	In the boy's locker room, several jocks held this other kid down and shoved the handle end of a broomstick up his ass. It was quietly covered up by the admins.
People with a mother tongue that isn't English, what are the most annoying things about the English language when you are trying to learn it?	That most native speakers can't even speak their own language, yet I'm supposed to learn the proper grammar and I'm judged by my accent.	Pronunciation of words. Took me years of watching tv shows in English for it to sound natural. It just seems like there's no firm rules to follow. Edit: spelling
So I nearly killed my best mate, and then he joked about it. What is the most perspective shifting experience you've ever had?	Don't feel too bad, at 50 mph, and given the amount of reenforcement the doors have, even if you hit that tree it is quite likely that he would survive.	I am a chemistry student and a couple of months ago I was doing something with cyanide gas. Now in my training I was told that if you swallow cyanide as the solid salt then you have about 10 minutes to get your shit together and take the "antidote" BUT if you breath in the gas then you have a minute and a half tops before you simply die. Anyway a piece of equipment I was using snapped in half blowing cyanide gas straight into my face just as I was breathing in. I knew exactly what should have happened so I put everything down, went into my office and sat quietly drinking a cup of tea (I'm British after all) certainly changed my perspective on life... Anyway obviously I didn't die but felt really ill for a couple of days. Oh and I've stopped using cyanide!
MEN of Reddit - How important is sex to you in a relationship?	Sex is vitally important to me as a human being, as an animal. My wife is extremely sexual, and that's one of the things I love about her, in addition to all the other stuff I love about her. If she ever became asexual, or couldn't have sex, due to hormone imbalance or injury or whatever... I would expect to get sex outside our relationship. And I would expect her to do the same if the roles reversed! We actually talked about this before the wedding, and are largely on the same page. So, long story short, my marriage is important, and sex is important. I prefer to have them together, but if that ever became not the case, I would take them separately.	I don't need or even necessarily want to have sex every day, but I'm not being in a sexless relationship.
Teachers/Students of Reddit - What is your greatest expulsion/suspension story?	A friend of mine was expelled for having a t-shirt on that said "Show me your boobs, bitch!". Shit hit the fan and one of the biggest daily newspaper around here brought up the story. Sadly nothing happened as the principal defended the teacher. Edit: Fix'd the entire post.	It was my freshman year of college, and it was finals week, and therefore 24-hour quiet hours in my dorm. Any violation of finals week quiet got you kicked the fuck out. One night I got into the elevator with a floormate and three of his guests. One of his guests had difficulty operating the elevator buttons, and when she got it right the guy and his guests applauded her great achievement. Elevator door opens at the ground floor to the bitchiest RA in existence. She asks for our IDs. Guy and his friends try to explain to her that I was just standing there, but she didn't give a fuck. I got called in to the resident director's office the following morning and I got evicted. I got evicted from my dorm for being in an elevator while other people clapped.
What's something that everyone loves that you absolutely hate?	Dogs. I hate them with my whole being. Why does every other human on the planet love them so much? I just don't get it.	That "why you gotta be so rude" song. I honestly don't care what it's about. The music drives me nuts.
What's the strangest coincidence you've ever experienced?	A good friend of mine has the middle name "Adam". Another good friend of mine has the middle name "Joseph". My first name is Adam and my middle name is Joseph.	Three friends of mine, whom I'd met in completely different circumstances each and who belonged in separate parts of my life, knew each other but only in one-on-one relationships. In short, we were a group of four guys, we all knew each other, and all of us thought the other three didn't know each other. We never got to hang out as a group, though.
What's the most awkward thing a family member has said to you in front of other family members?	I'd been really sick - really sick for about a year (Think stomach flu.) I commented that I didn't think I'd be eating lunch that day, because the stress was making me nauseous. My aunt then told me, in all seriousness, that if I didn't eat anything at all, then I'd lose all that weight! ... then we left to go say goodbye to my dying grandfather. Did I mention this aunt is a minister?... I'd hate to be one of her parishioners, because clearly, comforting the grieving is not her forte.	13 years old, big family Thanksgiving dinner. My uncle asks if I've started growing pubes yet. After everyone tells him what a crazy question that is, he insists that it's totally normal for an uncle to take an interest in a nephew's development.
What movie surprised you with how good it was?	Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Naive teenager sees Phantom Menace in theaters expecting mind to be blown, leaves bored and disappointed, becomes soured against future films. Cynical 34-year-old sees Force Awakens for a laugh, is surprised to find it quite entertaining, is now looking forward to the next installment, even some of the spin-offs.	Mean Girls. Never even considered watching it except a coworker quoted it constantly. Finally gave it a go and had to admit it was pretty good. Still not my kind of movie, but well done for the genre.
Redditors who've dated a celebrity. What was that like?	I went on a date with bill cosby...Or wait did I? Lol bill cosby downvoted me.Guess he dosent like rape jokes	High school janitor here! I haven't dated any celebrities but Eminem's daughter went to the school I work at. She dated a pretty buff guy but they eventually broke up when I started the rumor that he just wanted to meet her dad. I guess I have more fun than I should at my job, sue me.
People with anxiety problems: what do you think is the worst aspect of it?	For me - and others will disagree - it's everyone using anxiety as an excuse or a crutch. It devalues what myself and others 'suffer' (I hate this word too) through. I equate it to celiac's disease; the people that actually have it rough typically are nowhere near as vocal as the ones who don't. It's not fun at all, but you CAN power through with help and medication (in certain circumstances). I did, and will continue to do so. If I can do it, there is no reason someone else can't. But the crutch is too strong. It's too easy to claim anxiety/depression and have people cater to you. Fuck that. You CAN climb out of the darkness. You CAN go to that party. You CAN meet new people. The only thinks limiting yourself is YOU.	It's just physically exhausting. It's kinda like you have a huge physics final coming up that will make or break your grade, or an important presentation in front of a huge audience... but that's just how you feel every day. That constant, aggressive tension is just your "normal." It's your baseline. It's tiring.
Reddit, what are your college roommate horror stories?	Dude fucked this big, fat, nasty-ass black girl in MY bed and I didn't find out until a year later when she laid the bomb on me stating she "lost her virginity in my bed."	I had a roommate who basically stayed in our tiny room ALL DAY (I'm not even sure she went to class), and most of the time that I looked over at her she was looking at photos of herself on her computer. And her desk was covered in framed snapshots of herself. Not herself and friends; just herself. We were from different countries so I tried not to be weirded out by it too much, thinking it might be a cultural thing, but it was *strange*.
Bank Tellers of Reddit, what are some of the most depressing stories you have about people mismanaging their finances?	God I don't know how people deal with debt. My only debt is an $8000 auto loan and it makes me sick to think about. I don't know how I'll ever buy a home and be in debt for 30 years....	I worked for a student loan servicer. A friend had a woman call in who couldn't afford her $900 a month student loan bills. He figured that was fair as asked her how much she made monthly. "40" "No, I mean, how much do you make monthly." ".... 40 thousand."
Inspired by the most embarrassing moment topic. What's your luckiest moment of getting away with something when all signs say you should have been caught?	I used to work at one of the countrys highest profile schools for rich kids. One day myself and my coworkers decide to drop some acid. We ended up doing laps around the perimeter butt naked in the middle of the day. It was literally impossible for this to go undetected and yet somehow scott free. Super!	When I was a freshmen in college and living in the dorms, my roommate walked in on me masturbating. I somehow convinced him that I intended for him to walk in on me fake masturbating just to fuck with him.
Lucid dreamers of Reddit, what exactly do you do in your dreams?	Go to work. It's literally the fucking worst. Nothing is worse than working in your dream, feeling stressed out, having your subconscious make the worst possible things happen, and you endure it. Then the alarm goes off telling you it's time to...you got it, go to work. You literally feel exhausted because it feels like you just finished a shift. Those days are the worst. I've ONE TIME been able to teach myself how to fly. The dream ended when I hit something. Most of my lucid dreaming is working. I hate it.	I remember once lucid dreaming I got stuck in a sort of nightmare. it was sort of half lucid, because i was aware, could interact, and feel everything to an extent, but I was still wandering around trying to find the exit. any time these weird pig demons attacked me or charged me, I would stop them and say "I don't have time for this. I need directions." they were verily dissapointed.
How do you subtly fuck with people?	Make them think deeply about something meaningless they say. For example I was buying stamps at the post office yesterday. Paid with a card and the cute young attendant asked "if you could just sign here please." I asked her what if I can't sign here? She was visibly mindfucked and stumbled over what I can only imagine were sounds mimicking speach as I signed the receipt and walked off without another word	I worked the graveyard shift at a gas station and when stoners came in I'd greet them by saying "How, high are you!" with the same tone and inflection as "Hi, how are you?" they'd get half way down the candy isle and turn back to look at me questioning if they heard me right or they're just really high.
Bosses of Reddit, what's the WORST excuse someone has given you for being late?	E: im snowed in. M: i can see your house from here, there is no snow. E: its at the back door man. M: Use the front door. E: you spying on me? M: You live across the street, your blinds are open, i can see you in your underwear smoking a bowl with your room mate. E: dude youre like the NSA or something. M (facepalm)	That she had really bad diarrhea. It's a fine excuse, but no one fucking asked Sharon. We all come in late.
What's the stupidest reason you got suspended or detention (or both) for?	For most of these, it's not that single isolated incident that got them in trouble. It's all the other things students did up to that breaking point which escalated the repercussions. Everything has context.	I spilled some zippo lighter fluid on the floor. My friend and i were arguing if it would evaporate quickly or not. We solved the argument by lighting the floor on fire... as a teacher walked around the corner. Yes we were that stupid.
People who have actually MET Donald Trump, what was your impression of him?	I was at rally and he started throwing people out. Then after I talked to him briefly. Asked him about some of his plans if he wins. He didnt answer my question... He didn't seem interested in what I was saying at all. I think he's a huge a douche and a dickhead. Also, very pompous. He always seems like he only says things just to be elected instead of sincere. I've always been good at sniffing out bullshit tho. He's bad news.	I met him once when I was a kid, when I was lost in New York. I had just arrived at a hotel and was walking around looking for the sign-in desk when I asked this well-dressed man where the lobby was. He very kindly stopped to help. "Down the hall and to the left". Come to find out later that it was Donald Trump.
What was the stupidest thing your coworker did that got them fired?	There were 2. I used to go at a school and one go to got fired because she was fired for stealing Go-Gurt out of the freezer and denying she did it. She was caught on camera and still denied it. I'm pretty sure she was fired just for lying about it. Another girl from the same job would write down times she wasn't there. I think she got discovered because she would write that she started at 3, but she didn't get out of school until 3:20.	Had her identical twin sister cover for her for a week. Her sister had no idea how to do the job, it takes months to train just the basics. She was let go, or both of them were depending on your point of view.
has anyone married their back up plan?if so did it work out?	I don't understand people who think that if you're not married with kids, you failed at life. You don't have to have a wife and kids to leave a trace on this world. Why marry anyway? It's a useless historical tradition that needs to die.	I did. It started off as an honest joke. We set 30 as the age (we were 21). We kept lowering the age to see how far we could take the joke. One night we both realized how weird it would be to be married to someone else and still be best friends with each other. It turns out we couldn't imagine anyone else we would give up our close friendship for. So the age got moved down to 21 and we decided we better get cracking on wedding plans. We never dated, just wen straight from best friends to partners for life. We have been married 13 years and no matter how hard things get, we have always been best friends. Neither of us would trade it for the world.
What’s the most creative way you ever cheated in school?	3rd grade spelling test Teacher: "Surprise, I hope I get a surprise of everyone getting 100 on the spelling test today. Surprise" Me: "Me. G , How do you spell surprise? I know S U..." Teacher: "S U R P R I S E" Me: LOL. .....	High school in the 90's, we were allowed to use TI-85 graphing calculators on tests, provided the teacher watched us delete the memory, to prevent us from using it to cheat. I wrote a little program that simulated the process of wiping the memory, so I would just start up that program, step through the simulation in front of the teacher, then go back to my desk and exit the program and load up my cheat sheet.
What never fails to make you sleepy?	Benadryl. took some the other day with it knowing it makes you drowsy and then proceeded to fall asleep 30 minutes later instead of being productive whoops	The tv show How its Made, the narrator in that show was super soothing to me, and when I used to watch it, I’d fall asleep almost every time within minutes.
What scary movie scene freaked you the fuck out?	Though it's not a horror movie, I would say the scene in *The Wolf of Wall Street* where Leo was driving while on quaaludes. Actively seeing someone trying to maintain during a DUI made my butt cheeks clench like no other.	Two. 1. The scene in Signs where he puts the knife under the door to see the alien in the reflection. NOPE. 2. The scene in The Hills Have Eyes where the dad is roasting on the tree. That was some real sick shit.
I recently got a nice note instead of a parking ticket, Do any of you have a situation where you were pleasantly surprised by the system?	Little did you know, they did this so you would spread word of their "compassion". YOU CAN'T TRUST THE SYTEM!!!!	When I was a kid, I rode the school bus home. One day, I decided to go exploring, so I got off at the wrong stop on purpose. So after about an hour of wandering around (this is before everyone had a cell phone), I got lost and started panicking. I saw a cop car turn around the corner, and wanted to get his attention. I picked up a pebble, and chucked it at the cops windshield. It wasn't big enough to break the glass but it definitely got the attention. So the cop stops and sees a crying kid. I told him I was lost and he drove me home. Told me I could have just waved at him or something instead of throwing rocks at his car.
Americans, what do you actually think of Canadians?	Boring and insecure so they brag about how amazing their country is all the time to stay relevant because nobody is actually thinking about them ever	In general, I don't. They're like the neighbors next door that you never see, and when you happen to, they always wave back.
Why am I able to text message hundreds of useless emoticon images, but I still don't get to italicize anything?	Hate to break it to you, but when you text a silly emoticon to a dumbphone, the silly emoticon doesn't show up on theirs.	*Useless?* Are you trying to tell me a smiling piece of poop or a monkey sheepishly grinning and covering its mouth are useless? You're.....cold
What are some good tips for job hunting?	Three important things. 1. Have a job when you are looking for a job. This improves your perceived value and your bargaining position. 1. Keep your resume (very) short and simple. If you can't fit it on one page, you aren't done editing. 1. Network. Employers hire people they know, people they trust and people they like. Knowing those employers personally, or knowing somebody who the employers know, makes you *way* more likely to fit into one of those categories.	If you apply online, which most companies do now, go to the location you applied at and talk to the hiring manager. Put a face with the name. Chances are, you are one of hundreds of applicants. Most were put there by 'bots'
Teachers of Reddit, what is the worst case of bullying you have ever seen from a Teacher, or Student?	We had to make something for chemistry and there was this fat kid who was pretty much terrible at anything excluding picking flowers. Well the teacher assumed he created poison so was going to feed it to his pet, luckily this sweet girl helped him make it not so poisony. Wonder where Neville is now.	A kid once lost an eye in a "birthday prank" where ~15 students threw eggs at the guy. One hit him badly in the eye, and his reaction to try to take pieces of shell out of there immediately pretty much made it impossible to save it. Pranksters didn't even realize what had happend from what I heard. The kid didn't come back to that school, and the students were suspended for a month or something. It was a pretty peaceful month.
[Serious] [NSFW] What is the creepiest and/or most unexplainable thing that has ever happened to you or someone you know?	Looking at a picture of a blue and black dress and having every person around me agree that it is a gold and white dress.	My friend was driving without his glasses on in the middle of back country Maine one night. For those who have never been, you drive hours without seeing civilization. Just trees and trees. He was in a daze, when he saw something up ahead in the street. He stopped, couldn't quite make it out. It was moving. But moving very slowly. He got curious, moved real close to it on his truck. "Is that a baby?" Sure enough, it was a baby. He gets out of the truck, just stunned. Surely this baby is abandoned. Walks over there, goes to pick it up. It's a baby doll being dragged by slowly by a string. He got out of there fast as he could.
I saw a family trying to get their 10-12 year old daughter into a high chair to avoid paying an 18% party gratuity at a restaurant. What crazy things have you seen people do to get out of paying money?	That is hilarious, OP! That kid is going to grow up with no morals. Craziest thing I have ever seen: An old roommate of mine was a unhygenic in many ways. One thing she used to do was dumpster dive near factories and grocery stores for packaged food/drink that was just about to spoil, but wasn't technically spoiled yet. And she would eat it! One time she brought home a tray of Powerade type drinks and set it on the table. Some kind of slime was all over the bottom, and she refused to clean it >:(	I had an economics teacher who used to pretend like he was going to buy a car from car dealerships so he could get free credit reports. He'd go all the way through the process until they would run his credit to see if he was eligible for financing. Then he'd ask to see the report and walk away once he had read it.
Who do you dislike most in your workplace, and why?	I work in labor and delivery so like delivering babies, and the biggest pain in my job is when all the women are shocked at how painful it is, and how much work having a newborn is. It's the ignorance of my patients I just can't deal with. You would think people prepare at least a little bit regarding labor and newborn care before they take the plunge	It's a tie between my micromanaging boss and her spy that sits on our row to feed the boss information 🙄
At the end of a job interview they always ask "Would you like to ask any questions?" What question should the candidate ask?	If the pay has not been mentioned up to this point, it is an ideal point to ask what the rate of pay is.	Ask them for a brief summary of *their* time with the company. Favorite aspects, challenges, overall experience of working there. You'll be surprised how well received it is. Shows that you are interested, but also that you still have a decision to make. Plus people like talking about themselves.
Photo developers: whats the craziest thing you have ever seen in a photo you were developing?	Wet T-shirt contest! That, and pictures of a dead person in a casket. (he went right from fun to morbid, wtf)	One disposable camera that I developed had a bunch of pictures of an elderly woman in a hospital. Her face was all bruised and bloodied, and honestly I worried that she was dead at first. By the end of the roll, though, her bruises had started to heal, and she was smiling at the camera. I guess someone wanted to document the injury. It was still weird as hell, though.
[Serious] People who witnessed, or were victims of attempted murder, what happened?	I used to hang with surenos when i was young and stupid, so this is an interesting story, i never thought I'd read anything about the sur or the norte on Reddit so this is a first, but anyway im glad everyone was ok, it's a shame that these motherfucker's can't even manage to be civilized on a holiday that's all about family (real family) but anyway where you from?	Dude stabbed a guy at the ATM and tried to grab his money. Dude that got stabbed punched him in the face and knocked him flat, then a bunch of people grabbed him and he got arrested. I assume the stabbed guy is fine, he didn't seem too bothered about having had a knife in him a few minutes previously.
What was the funniest sexual myth you ever had?	"Pull out method never works" I've been doing it for 17 years, and in my 31 years of life it's always worked for me with every woman I've been with, the one 61 year old dude who I got drunk with, both my hands, and both my feet.	I didn't know they would cum, so I thought people had sex just 'cause and finish whenever they wanted to
What is something unusual that you always carry with you?	I have a Nazar eye talisman in my car, hanging from my rearview mirror. I also keep an owl power animal in a pouch in my purse, with a couple crystal gemstones to help soothe and calm anxiety.	I keep a Pokemon card in my wallet. It's been in there since my freshman year of high school, my best friend gave it to me. We don't talk anymore, but I still keep it as a reminder of the good memories.
People of Reddit, what is/are something(s) that you know you will regret for the rest of your life?	So so many... killing me inside every day... off the meds a few days and they are rushing back into me.. very hard to take..	I never tried to be an extra in the Captain America movie. Damn it, Steve, I would've stood beside you!
Your worst enemy is now your neighbour: what do you do to annoy him/her the most?	My worst enemy is the guy who raped me habitually as a kid, if I ever saw that mother fucker again I would kill him. I would take a baseball bat and beat him over the head until it was a unrecognizable bloody pulp.	Play music just a little too late at night but never late enough that he can call the cops. Invite friends over and have one of them park in front of his house...even if there is space available. Set up yard lights around the house and forget to turn off the ones on his side. Order something that comes in an inordinately large box, and have it delivered mistakenly to his house. Steal his paper every morning. Flip his mailbox flag up/down. Mow my yard just a little shorter on his side so it looks like he is slacking. Leave one empty beer can in his bushes. Set up something on the lawn for every holiday, encroach on his property by an inch or two. Lastly, make sure to always leave one window open when I walk around the house in my underwear.
What's the weirdest thing you've seen while driving?	I once saw a Decepticon car. Not one where it simply has the insignia somewhere but it had it on the back. Thats not what was odd though. What was odd was that besides the liscence plate, there was nothing else on it, no Chevy, Ford, etc., nothing. Really got me for a moment.	Not a truck driver but one time i was driving and there oncoming car in the other lane in which the driver was playing a trumpet. One hand on the wheel and just blowing his trumpet. His windows were up so you couldnt hear him and he was the only one in the car.
What has been your personal favorite moment on reddit?	When a bunch of people in this thread got gold just by asking so I thought I'd do the same to restore my faith in humanity. (pleeeease?)	Rick Astley's AMA, he was genuinely a really cool guy and there were so many Rick Rolls it was unbelievable, oh and when he told someone to go fuck themself.
What do you hate the most when going out to eat at a restaurant?	When I ask for water and they don't ask me if I want lemon with it and bring it to me anyway. I don't want the damn lemon, why didn't you ask me? Now I have to awkwardly take it off of my glass and put it on a napkin or something. Please just ask if I want the damn lemon and don't automatically bring it to me.	When a restaurant is so concerned with turnover that they rush you through a meal. There is a local place that brings your check 5 mins after you've gotten your food, and another one that if you haven't paid your check within 10 mins of finishing your food they will come ask you to please free up the table for other customers.
What is one thing an alien should know before visiting Earth?	We have a thing called social media which stops people being social and have their heads in their phone all day	Bring their own camera if they want vacation pictures, the cameras we have only take blurry pics of aliens, bigfoot, ghost....
Men of reddit, what NSFW male lifestyle hack can you share?	Do not get married. Do not have children. By following these two things, you will extend your life and your happiness. Just because it feels good to think about having kids, doesn't mean you should. Just because it feels good to think about having a vagina around your home all the time that you have easy access to, doesn't mean it would be good. Have friends. Get a dog/cat. Do activities. Have multiple girlfriends. Have none and work on yourself. Whatever you want, that's fine - just make sure you don't get saddled up. It's not worth it.	If you're going down on a girl, and she shifts, don't shift with her. she's trying to get you to hit a certain spot
What company has forever lost your business and why?	American eagle. One time I walked in trying to buy some clothes and none of the employees would help me. When I asked for help she laughed at me because I was wearing clothes from my workout and I was all sweaty and stuff. It was one of the most insulting moments of my life and I will never shop there again. Edit: since everyone is calling me an asshole for showing up sweaty. Why do you all assume I was trying on clothes? I know what size Tshirt I wear, and I was asking her if she had any in my size and she ignored me and mocked me.	Tesco. A few Christmases ago my mum went in to buy a TV. They refused to help her carry it to her car because if they drop the TV the store is liable to replace it. The reason my mum wanted help is that she was going through radiotherapy at the time and wasn't strong enough. They instead offered to hold it back until my dad got there the next day, so she accepted. Dad gets there and they wanted another £50 for the TV because the price went up overnight, even though my mum had already paid for it. Dad refused, walked out with the TV, they called the police and he got arrested. At the station he explains everything and gets released without charges, then goes back to the store and picks up the TV. Tesco are a bunch of money grabbing cunts.
If there were only two names (one for women, one for men) what would you want them to be?	Dave and Debbie. And then for the odd one out who wants to be "unique," we can call them Slagathor.	Beep and Boop. "So me, beep, boop boop beep boop beep and boop are going to a party on Sunday, you want to come?
If you could have coffee with your 14 year old self, what would he/she be most surprised to hear about you?	How big I am. I didn't hit puberty growth spurt until 15-16. I'm 6'3" now and I'm constantly worried that I scare people with my size.	That I can finally grow a mustache, and once I grew the mustache I'd realize that I don't look good in a mustache.
[NSFW] What's your NSFW story that you've always wanted to share but never had the right topic?	I was having sex for the second (up untill now last) time in my life when my little brother came in. I was quick enough to lay next to her when he came in but i came aswell because i was just about to finish when he came barging in. We had blankets covering everything but it was awkward as hell.	My friend kept telling me about how his wife had pink eye for a week. In reality she was taking loads to the face by strangers at a glory hole and ended up with an eye infection.
What were you warned about when you were younger, but never actually encountered?	When making out with a girl, if the girl stops me from feeling up her body, let it go. Don't touch her by force. I'm still single.	All my high school teachers said college professors wouldn't care or help me out at all if I was having issues. College professors ended up being infinitely more helpful and caring than any high school teacher I had. Maybe a good college. Maybe a bad high school.
I broke both of my arms on Sunday, now what do I do?	If you haven't already, go to a hospital. Your bones need to be set in line otherwise they are going to heal all wonky, and you'll have wonky arms for the rest of your life, or until you break them again. Tell a doctor what happened (no need to be embarrassed, doctors deal with this kind of thing all the time) and they will help you. Good luck!	I cant hold my 360 controller either :( Funny thing is first thing my uncle said when he walked into my room was " You could probably get a few sympathy handjobs out of this."
Redditors, what is your worst memory of someone you currently love?	One of my best friends pissed in a coffee cup in the same car as me on our way to an event. It was my Dad’s coffee cup, that we proceeded to throw out the window on the highway. (it was hysterical)	"Honey, I need you to drive. I think I'm having a heart attack." The EMS station was closer than the hospital. If I had driven to the hospital, he wouldn't have been able to get the drug that prevents heart damage. I got 17 more years with my dad that day.
What's the dumbest way you've injured yourself?	Broke my leg falling off a razor scooter. I fell 2 inches and broke my leg. I actually walked on it the rest of the day because I didn't think it couldn't possible be that bad.	I got a concussion playing monopoly. We were playing a game and I accused my sister of cheating, I forget why. There was a massive argument and a huge blow up and I tried to fly kick her, slipped on the tiles fell back and knocked myself out on the tiles. This was day one of our holiday. On day three of the holiday, we were on a boat and I fell down the stairs, trying to slide down the balustrade and bruised my back and tailbone. My parents just gave up on the holiday after this point.
If 9/11 happened two months earlier, what do you think the store 7/11 would have done afterwards?	Well, for starters, 9/11 doesn’t make sense anyway, because 9/11 is the 9th of November. Americans have it wrong. It should be 11/9. So to answer your question, nothing would happen, because if it were two days earlier, it would be 7/9, not 7/11... America can downvote me, the rest of the world knows I speak the truth, moohwhahahah.	A majority of the 7-11 company is owned by a Japanese group called "7 & i Holdings," so a lot of the Japanese stores already use a "7i" sign. I guess they could just switch to that.
Last night my cat jumped on my back and stood there for a minute or two while I was in the middle of sex with my wife. What is your most awkward sex, interrupted moment?	Was rubbing this girl in a NSFW way at her place, and we were really getting into it. Then her freaking six year old kid shows up, gets an eyeful of fingers up her snatch, and asks if she can have some water. This was after midnight so we thought he would be have stayed asleep.	My wife and I were going at it on the floor of the living room one night. My 3 yr old walks out real quiet like and yells "What are you doing to my mommy???" Started crying and ran back to his room. Edit: Read TenBeers reply below... his prose is magnificent.
What is the worst smell you have ever experienced?	The Emo's at school smell pretty rancid. That said, nobody ever goes near them. Even walking past in class is dreadful.	On my last day of High school a group of guys snuck into the cafeteria during class and took a dump in one of the microwaves and set the time to 9:99. By the time someone noticed the apparently flaming turds it was too late. The school was evacuted due to the smell, and several people were throwing up near "ground zero". It was by far the worst smell me, or any of my friends that were there have ever smelled. To my memory it was a combination of burnt hair, newly stepped on dog poo, and burnt toast.
Why do non-porn movies (like forgetting Sarah Marshall) show penis but never vagina?	Because to show vagina generally requires a speculum and stirrups, or at least some pretty awkward and unnatural camera positioning. Or maybe you didn't actually mean "vagina"? A muff covered vulva is quite dressed compared to a swinging richard, but shaved with all the feminine details? Not yet and not in America.	They won't show an erect penis. Or pink vagina. Those are too aggressively sexual. They'll show a flaccid penis or a bush though
Lawyers of reddit what was the weirdest case you worked on?	I pointed alot, slammed the table for dramatic effect and shouted OBJECTION! in court, there was this acolyte girl who could speak with the dead, she liked hamburgers, also she gave me a charm that tells me if people are hiding the truth	Not a lawyer, but work at a law firm. There's a case where a crazy lady's neighbor was allowed to have chickens in their yard. So she bought pigs, and the HOA or city stepped in and made her get rid of them. It was a suburban area. In retaliation, this lady buys 5,000 chickens from Tyson and unleashed them into her half acre backyard. The chickens all die, obviously. She sued the trucking company that brought the chickens for "defective chickens" and negligent infliction of emotional distress because her daughter had to view the "gore" of 5,000 dead chickens in her back yard. she was *pro se* of course.
What's something everyone knows but no one wants to admit?	Pretty sure even hardcore Hillary fans know the woman is a couple beers short of a six pack. Some people just want to watch the world burn I guess	People want to see others doing well, but not better than them. edit: i get that not everyone agrees with this, and thats good
What the most sexual way you can describe the least sexual thing you can think of?	It's easy, really. To make ANYTHING sound super sexual, all you have to do is add "if you know what I mean" to the end of the sentence. I ate a banana. If you know what I mean. I went to sleep. If you know what I mean. I went to work. If you know what I mean. Im going to get karma for this comment. If you know what I mean.	Sliding my fingers over her shining body, I cannot help but wonder if this is what heaven feels like. It is the dead of winter, but she is burning hot, completely aglow. Her steady breath warms my shaking wrist as I reach to press that button which I know will really turn her on. My laptop sure is lovely.
What are some of your secret personal superstitions?	I have all the classics like walking under ladders, black cats, spilling salt etc. But some of the odd ones for me are tapping the dashboard when i go through a yellow light, counting the letters of words or sentences and adding words in my mind to make the count divisible by 5, I dont use yellow lighters...theres more but im blanking on them, most of them i just do naturally, i dont really think about it...	Parade Theory- Basically, you are in an alley, about to take a piss. No one is around. You look left, you look right...no one. You get close to the dumpster, unzip your pants and let it flow... And a car comes down the alley, two people walk past, and a stray dog watches you piss.
Have you ever complimented or been complimented by a complete stranger? What happened?	I get compliments all the time... What do I do? I say thank you and go about my day....how else am I supposed to act? I also compliment people all the time as well... and they do the same thing	A few years ago I was out shopping with my wife and I was wearing a Wayne Gretzky hockey jersey. As I was returning the shopping cart to the cart corral a guy drove passed, stopped, put his car in reverse, drove back to me, rolled down the window and said "sweet jersey dude" and drove off. It really made my day.
What is the dumbest thing that you got punished for when you were in school?	/r/pussypass trigger warning. 5th grade, lunch line with myself ahead of four girls I knew (one used to have a crush on me but she was nasty). We're talking and joking around and I blew a very weak "raspberry" towards the yougurt which was behind sneeze glass and said "there now you cant eat them". Guarenteed it was more of a sound effect. The girls just did their "I'm telling!!! You spit all over the food!" A few hours later get called into principals office, they said they had to throw put all the yogurt, then principal and me discuss the events that occured with the nasty girl that had a crush on me where I tried to plead my case. Didn't work and sent me home early, called my parents. Mother grounded me for being a "stupid ass". Fuck you Melissa.	I dropped my lunch all over the floor and it made a huge mess. I offered to help the janitor clean it up after everyone left. Got suspended for being in the cafeteria "after hours."
Who had the best life ever?	As much as I hate the man... Trump. Born rich. Inherited wealth. TV "star". "Billionaire". President of United States. Too bad he will die universally hated and his family will forever carry that burden.	Sir Christopher Lee Featured in more than 250 movies and TV shows, saw the last execution by the guillotine, served in WW2 and hunted Nazis, only member of the cast of LOTR that actually met Tolkien, released a metal album at the age of 88, was knighted. Dying was the only thing left for him to do
[Serious] "Failed" professional musicians, actors, artists, etc. When was the moment you realized you had to give in, get a "stable" job and make your passion a hobby instead?	When I realized that I'd basically grown up listening to the wrong things and don't understand how to make 'rock music' as it's currently defined. I don't have the social skills to form a band with others my own age and I also learned that 15 years of playing the guitar won't mean shit if there's another guy who's better looking who possesses a bought and paid for singing voice who's only been playing for a fraction of the time I have.	When I realized that my job is not representative of me as a person and I'd rather be able to support my family than scrape by as a slightly above average artist. Edit: Thanks for the gold!
What did you not understand as a kid, but you now understand as an adult?	That religion is an opiate of the masses put in place decades ago before we knew things. Now it remains to control the masses that are blind to reality. Edit: grammar because of the nazi	Vacations and breaks aren't a given. You don't just get to stop working for a few weeks randomly throughout the year, and no one plans around your vacation - *you* must plan all of *your own* (and sometimes other people's) work around your departures. Oh, and vacations are expensive. There's probably a reason that Billy down the block's family is able to take five people to Disneyworld: because they have money. I'm a violin teacher now and blew this poor kid's mind this past weekend when he asked me what I was doing for spring break. I sort of stared at him for a second, and then remembered that spring break is a thing that kids get...so I told him that I'm working because I don't get a spring break and he was just completely aghast. Sorry buddy, the adult world isn't as fun as being a kid.
What films would make a great TV series?	Harry Potter, hands down. 7 seasons (1 book per season), approximate 1-3 chapters per episode (depending on how big the chapters are). It wouldn't have been rushed, you'd get to see a lot of the cool stuff that the movies cut out and anyone that read the book wouldn't feel a sense of betrayal and utter disappointment while watching it on-screen	Men In Black. I can't think of any reason why this wouldn't work. 2 agents investigating strange events happening to alien lifeforms on earth. Black humor with a hint of scifi.
What are you in the mood to get in an argument about?	How people can possibly think that Trump is a more unfit candidate than Hillary because he said "grab her by the pussy" in a private conversation with someone. Not only is it completely trivial, it also goes to show what the "progressive" voters think about privacy of the individual. I just can't wrap my head around how this woman who's gone on record saying blacks are thugs, gays are sacrilegious, voted in favor of the Iraq invasion, takes money from Saudi Arabia and big businesses, is criminally negligent, is obviously withholding information contained on her bleached email servers can POSSIBLY be on equal footing with a guy who's said some things that at worst can be interpreted as sexist.	I would like to argue this question, "If you put a werewolf on the MOON, would it be a werewolf at all times?"
US Redditors who have lived in multiple regions (ie North, South, Midwest, etc), what difference stood out to you most between living in there areas?	The number of people in the South who wear their Christianity on their sleeve is shocking to us Northerners. I could never live in the South again. Neighbors and co-workers thought nothing of imploring me to attend church or even worse visit their church. Plus all the religious pronouncement a throughout the day. Enough already. Give me the secular, rational North any day.	I went to college in southern California. It was as laid back as you might imagine- everyone wore shorts and a t-shirt with sandals (I used to not be a sandal person, but then I realized I was literally the only one wearing shoes). I did a semester in DC. Before it started, there was an info session talking about what to expect in DC. They literally had to tell people not to wear shorts to an official function.
What used to be a big deal but isn't any more?	Opening or leaving the door open for some people. Open it and you're a sexist cis white shitlord. Don't and you're an ass	Long distance calls. The entire phone industry used to revolve around long distance calling. Who had the best rates? when was the best time to call? how much did I pay in long distance this month?
Couples who have moved in together, what surprised you most about living with a male/female?	How complicated girls make everything. Everything's a debate. Everything needs to be discussed. How soon they don't want to shag anymore. How they complain about everything. Makes paying bills easier though.	Methods of storage Me - however method to madness Her - organised Several conversations have gone like this: Me - "where is my blue notebook it was on this shelf under my components box" Her - "I cleaned up and organised everything" Me - "Ok where is it?" Her - "I don't know why don't you keep track of your stuff"
Today, i went back to my highschool to say goodbye to a teacher who had a huge impact on me. He was retiring. With tears in his eyes, he looked around his classroom and said, "i liked it". I almost cried. What's simple words have been emotional tidal waves to you?	"LET'S GO CELTICS" Edit: At the Celtics game last night they were down by 20 with 3 minutes left and the crowd started chanting this. It was really cool and showed how real fans stick around and support their team even during a loss. I probably should have clarified but there's no need to down vote.	At my grandfather's viewing, when my grandmother leaned in and said "we had a good life, didn't we?" As if she had died too.
What's something that your parents didn't let you do because of a dumb reason?	My mom never sent me to camp because "I didn't want to go". Yes, because a child knows what's best for him. I also didn't want to do homework, but that didn't stop them from forcing it down my throat	When I was younger (10-14 ish) my dad wouldn't let me play online multiplayer games with others "Because people on the internet are assholes." Back then I thought it was bullshit, and now I know he was right. So very right.
Why does wikipedia need so much donation money?	Wikipedia contains knowledge, and knowledge is power, and power is money. And money can't buy you love. So they are developing a loverobot.	It's a top 10 website. That costs millions of dollars in servers and bandwidth each year... before you pay a single salary. It probably runs on well under 5% of the budget of any other site in the top 50. And still people are like "well that's too much..."?
What boardgame would you recommend?	Candyland although it is completely a game of luck, playing with your adult friends is probably one of the funniest experiences especially when someone gets Plumpy. EDIT: My friends and I are very lame, just realized this.	Betrayal at House on the Hill RISK 2210 Ticket to Ride Flash Point Forbidden Island Those last two are great cooperative games, good if you have a sore loser or overly competitive player in the group. Edit: Flash Point is a cooperative firefighting game in which you attempt to rescue people and pets from burning buildings. It's good for both seasoned and casual board gamers, and it includes an advanced mode of play. There are several expansions available.
How do I get "fundraisers" to stop sending my paranoid grandfather donation letters before he drains his life savings?	Start sending him your own requests. Deposit the money he sends to you in an account you hold for his benefit.	I don't know what the rules are in the US, but over here in the UK we'd probably say that it's about time that someone in the family took power of attorney over your grandfather's money for his own safety. He doesn't sound like he's able to look after his own affairs. This happened with my grandmother who was in a similar situation after a stroke.
What's a mistake that you're glad you made?	Joining a fraternity. I hate fraternities, what people do to rush freshman, and how people get so into their bros and raging balls everyday. I hate sororities even more, they suck originality out of girls and make all the girls hate each other. But I sure as hell am glad I am in one. I have an extra group of guys I can always go chill with, I get to go on sweet formals paid for by loaded alumni, girls automatically think I'm somewhat cool (I go to a very shallow school), and I dont just sit around all day with nothing to do like my friend who are GDIs.	I was on IRC back in 1997 chatting in #teens when some random girl with a freaky username messages me. I don't usually respond to "ASL" chats, but for some reason I did. She was very depressed and suicidal because of her situation with her parents. I didn't want to get involved but did anyways. I gave her my phone number and address so we could talk offline, which I knew at the time was a mistake since this girl was not right. Eventually things cooled down. Now we're married and have been together for 14 years. Best mistake of my life.
I'm 23 years old. I just found out that I should have been wearing glasses my whole life. I just got my first pair and it's shocking. Have you ever had one of your senses fixed later in life? What was the experience like?	I can hear rhythms that to me, sound very obvious, but others do not pick up on. As a rapper this has helped me catch very cool rhythms in my flow. I'm not sure if I'm actually hearing a different rhythm or if I precieve sound differently, but when I tap my foot with my friends I'm always "off beat", but I am doing it to the beat I actually hear so its weird. I have super sensitive hearing and sometimes its tortuous.	I got glasses when I was five. On the way home I told my mum "they got new cows." She asked me how I knew, and I said it was because the new cows were black and white. "But the cows have always been black and white...?" "No, Mummy, the old cows were grey but these new ones are black and white!" It made my mum cry. She had only gotten my eyes tested because my sister was at risk for poor eyesight from a prior disease and needed hers tested, and my mum just figured might as well test all of us. They thought I was just clumsy because I walked into door frames and furniture all the time :-/
What is awkward but really shouldn't be ?	Asking for sex. No seriously. It should be possible just to say to someone you know "Want to enjoy some sex?" in exactly the same way you might offer a back rub. You don't want to? Sure thing, no problem.	Bumping into a vague acquaintance at the grocery store, saying hi, carrying on with your shopping, seeing them again in the next aisle, not knowing quite what to do, walking past each other awkwardly, seeing them again in the next aisle...
[Serious] Which person that you know on a personal level has the saddest life story and why?	I know a man who was an executive for a big corporation and made really good money, like really good. His daughters husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer like right after the wedding. It killed him because he has all the money in the world to help but he can't do a thing besides watch him and his daughter suffer.	Guy in town. Had wife, two sons, and two daughters. Out of the blue, their younger son died of an aneurysm at the age of 5. Few years later, his wife is pregnant and has an aneurysm and dies. Baby didn't make it. This past December his older daughter, a senior in high school, went into the hospital with a bad case of flu. Turned out to be a very rare cancer, she died a week later. That poor fucking family.
[Serious] Should organ donation be opt-out instead of opt-in?	Yes, simple as. People need that shit yo, and if you have a problem, just opt out. So many problems in the world can be sorted by people just making the right changes. It's an atrocity that people still die on waiting lists.	There is actually a really interesting TED talk that mentions this topic. I forgot what country it was, but after they changed the phrasing on drivers license forms from "Check to become an organ donor" to "Check to NOT be an organ donor" the number of people who were organ donors increased by something like 60%. I can't remember the exact TED talk but if anyone knows it, feel free to link it.
Reddit, when did you not speak up when you should have?	Only thing that I can think of is about /r/IAmA which made me feel lame but then I realize that I always speak up in real life so I was happy again.	For a few years I lived in a sketchy arctic community. A lot of the Inuit there had a problem with domestic abuse. You'd always hear fights, see blood on the ice from the night before, see kids walking around at night to get away from their alcoholic parents. One day I was walking to work and this man was grabbing a woman as she was freaking out. She was full on screaming in broad daylight and I did fuck all to stop the situation. There are other times I'd walk by women sobbing on the side of the road. The few attempts I'd ever made to get involved with the locals, they'd drag you into hell. You'd think you were helping and they'd tell you to fuck off, so I stopped helping. I'm not sure my soul is in great shape.
I am a high school teacher. How can I mess with my students tomorrow on 4/20?	If you play a prank on your students because you know they are high, doesn't that put you in an awkward position? I'm assuming if they were drunk you'd have to report them right? If you like teaching that much, I wouldn't acknowledge the day, you are their teacher, not their buddy. Edit: downvote me all you want. I'm right. Trying to be cool is a mistake in this instance.	Walk into the room, speak for a bit. Invent some pretext for leaving the room, close the door, count to 5. Go in and repeat your original intro, word for word, movement for movement.
You have the ability to teleport objects smaller than a shoebox to any location. How would you use that power for Evil?	Teleport a grenade to Obamas face. Not inside, but right in front so he can see it for a second. Edit: I don't want to be that guy, but he said evil. Killing the president of a super power country would be pretty evil/ cause chaos.	Dopamine and oxytocin into the brain of anyone speaking to me. I would, eventually, be universally beloved due to chemical mind control.
If you could banish one popular internet thing to oblivion what would it be?	Anonymity cause humans are social animals that need to follow good social etiquette....which is what everyone does on a regular basis. Anonymity on the internet can have guys asking about “pussy lips or GTFO” while in real person they would never say this. It's like the internet gives them a second personality.	Ads with sound that auto play and you can't silence. "Oh no, it's fine. I wasn't just listening to music in another window, *Glade advertisement*. It's fine, really."
Why do europeans hate gypsies so much?	There are millions of gypsies. A significant portion behave as described in this thread, but they do not deserve to be saddled with this stereotype. Just substitute <your-favorite-race-to-hate> in any of this threads comments and hopefully you'll get that uncomfortable feeling. It is the thieves and beggars that behave this way, not the gypsies. The actual number is subject to dispute, but during WWII, anywhere from 250,000 to 1,500,000 gypsies were killed along with the Jewish population. This is where this hatred leads.	They stole my aunt when she was 4. She was gone 2 days before my mom who was 12 at the time found her sitting, made up to look like a "native" in the lap of an old lady. Needless to say they were run out of the village my family lived in(former yugoslavia)
What does a $300,000 house look like where you are from?	Four beds, four baths, 2672 square feet with a decent sized yard, built in '94. That's in town, so if you're willing to commute (15-20 min) you can get the same sized house with a couple of acres.	One story 3 bedroom house with one bathroom and a small kitchen. You have to love the east coast life.
What comes to mind when you think about India ?	Rape, brown people with mustaches, shitty structures, the Taj Mahal, forehead dots, just a really shitty hellhole place to be really	The scenes of terrible poverty offset by the stunning natural beauty and colorful (literally) culture. It's an amazing place to visit if you get the chance. Tough but rewarding. Didn't get raped personally.
There was a time when most families could afford a three bedroom home on one income, what happened? How do we get back to that?	Post WWII Workers Unions that has gained great influence during the depression resulted in higher wages for U.S. workers. Unions went away, due to government and business policies, the wages have been declining ever since. If we want higher wages we have to return to such organization. We could even go further as workers and just seize the means of production, and thus eliminate the fact that the bosses and owners make so much more than the workers. The answer is as it was back then a people united will never be defeated, to quite Marx “we have nothing to lose but our chains and the world to win.” Workers of the World Unite!	Beyond what others have already said, our standard of living and expected secondary expenses are FAR higher now than they were in the mid 20th century. Blame technology and longer life expectancy, among other things.
[Serious] People who've "disappeared" to start over. How &amp; why did you do it &amp; what was the outcome?	Pretty good , i got a girlfriend but she broke upwith me when sge dound out . This all happened recently so i still feel the pain.	I packed up all my stuff and moved to a different state because I had fallen in unrequited love with a girl and made a fool of myself and it was too painful to live with the consequences. I moved to a new city where I didn't really know anyone. I learned that no matter where you go, there you are. If you have regrets, or anxieties, those will still be with you in a new place. It's been 2 years and I really miss my friends, but I still have work to do on me, so I'm not ready to go back yet.
What problems did we face 10 years ago that we don't any more?	Choosing between making phone call or using internet at a time. Edit: This is irrelevant for some people because they lived ahead of time, of course depending on the country. Not every part of world can catch up the same technology.	Having a limited amount of texts you could send per month before you got charged out the ass on your cell phone plan. Now calls and text are usually unlimited.
What is your rant of the day?	Americans stop your bullshit with the guns! Another fucking mass shooting at the airport is in the news, can't you see where the problem is?	Read the entire fucking email before you reply to it, saving me having to forward it back to you with bits highlighted, making you look like a moron and me a petty, passive-aggressive twat.
Reddit, what is the scariest or most exciting fact about where you live?	We had the first ever SUPERKMART! I say had because it was one of the first to close as well.	We have huge walls (some 25ft high) all over the city to keep the two main religious communities apart....to stop them trying to kill each other basically!
People with strict parents how did they react when you finally stopped obeying them?	I have a great relationship with my parents, we very rarely argued through my childhood and get on really well now. They certainly weren't strict, so I guess this isn't the question, but I still remember the first argument with my parents I 'won'. As in I logically outmaneuvered them and they sort of went "Fine, sure, have it your way". I remember it well because the high was so short. I learned an enormous amount about how winning arguments with loved ones is never actually a victory in that moment.	They grounded me for 6 months, constantly told me I was lazy and wouldn't amount to anything. Then tried to get me to do chores around the house, proceed to yell at me for the shitty job I did though it was better than they ever did. I started to tell them, I guess I'm just lazy and suck. Whenever they'd say anything negative about me I'd say, 'yep, you're right' and go on about my day. They'd get mad and say I was acting like a victim, I told them I was just agreeing with them and that's what they wanted and I was done arguing/trying to prove them wrong. That's what they wanted afterall, to be right so I let them have it. They gave up and left me alone when they got pregnant with my younger brother. I was happy to no long be their sole focus.
What’s the strangest thing you’ve ever seen someone casually do while you were in their home?	The strangest is when im at a friends house and they just dig into there pants to udjust or scratch their balls. Pay attention. No guest wants to fucking see that it makes me uncomfortable and others.	Gave plates to their dogs to lick clean, and put the plates directly back into the cabinets. I'm hoping they were fucking with me
I wore the same clothes for 56 days before someone finally said something. What amateur psychology experiments have you done?	I like to drive right around the speed limit on the highway. When I notice another car gaining on me, I gently accelerate to see if they will too in order to complete the pass. Most do and will not back down even when you have driven a few miles at 15-20 over the speed limit.	I gave a 30 question science test that was multiple choice. I put a period at the end of each of the correct answers. No one noticed. EDIT: After I gave the class the test back I asked if anyone noticed and I assured them that I wasn't going to do it again. No one said that they noticed.
What do you do in bed when your partner has fallen asleep?	Go in the bathroom and rub one out(well some nights). lightly squeeze her breasts until she wakes up and has sex. spoon.	I use the opportunity to take back the covers that my wife pulled off of me as she was getting comfortable.
If all humans disappeared today, and aliens show up tommrow, what place on Earth would be most mysterious to them?	I don't know, but there would be so many ironic selfies taken in front of the world's various "Welcome, Aliens!" billboards.	If they're anything like *our* archaeologists, I'd say sex shops. "The people who lived here made intricate symbols and sculptures for their various fertility rituals, and kept them in shrines such as this one."
What is the dumbest way you've ever injured yourself?	I shut my own head in a car door while trying to quickly get into said car. To this day I'm still not sure how I managed it.	When I was 13 or so, my sister and I were in the kitchen, joking around. She pulled out a big ass knife and pretended to threaten me. As she did this, she began to sneeze. This was no ordinary sneeze, however. The build up sounded like a bloodthirsty battle cry, and as I turned to face her (I was initially turned the other way) I saw her screech and lunge (sneeze reflex) towards me with the knife. Being the coordinated person I am, I jumped up, and smashed straight into the fridge, dislocating my shoulder.
What is the creepiest thing you've ever done while pursuing a person you were sexually or romantically interested in?	Switching my phone onto airplane mode so I can screenshot their hot snapchats without the app letting them know I screenshotted. Trying to whack one off inside a 10 second snapchat story proves difficult. The struggle... ^ I don't actually do this, just thought it would bring the giggles out. I'm not that creepy, gosh!	Started talking to this guy awhile back and he had his first initial tattooed on one of his wrists. I crept so far back through his Facebook that I found him discussing how he wanted his second initial on his other wrist. Well one day we were hanging out and I ever so gently grabbed his wrist and said, "you know what you should do, you should get your second initial tattooed on this wrist." He looked at me like I was his soulmate. I felt so guilty and creepy all at the same time. We are not dating anymore.
If you speak two languges, how does your inner monologue sound?	It’s what your native language is I speak a couple of languages but I only speak English to my inner demons. Or maybe that’s the only language they know	I was born and grew up in Germany but I've been living in the UK for over 7 years now. My inner monologue is English about 90% of the time. When I go back to Germany it becomes a muddled mess of both languages. It's rarely ever just German now.
[Serious] People that live in more violent or crime ridden cities, what daily things do you do out of habit to protect yourself that people in safer areas might not know about?	As someone who lives in Scotland, the lengths that Americans are going to just to walk around there own town absolutely disgusts me. I can't understand why anybody from here would want to move to America, I can literally walk around at any regular time of day without worry, I can see a police officer and say hello, or have a conversation without the slightest of worry... And I don't live in the countryside, I live 20 minutes from Glasgow and in a region of around 400,000 people...	Detroit, seriously people just be aware of your surroundings, no headphones, keep in lit areas stay away from hidden corners/trees. Also the best thing that I have learned is have confidence act like you live there. I generally snack on my way home in the dark, everyone thinks you live there if you are snacking.
What's the most absurd excuse someone has given you for being late that turned out to be true?	“I was fucking your sister.” In my defense, I didn’t think he could open the coffin. Oh, well... at least he got a shock seeing her still alive.	Had a staff member call me to say they weren't sure they could come into work because someone had stolen their front door. I lived around the corner from them so on the way to work I drove past their house and sure enough they were there with the police filing a report on a missing door.
Reddit, what was the most awkward, uncomfortable experience you've ever had in your life?	Finally mustering the guts to ask a girl out, calling her that night, new bf answers and starts taunting me how she can't get too the phone cause she's too busy giving him a gobby. Broke my fist punching a streetlight. gg	It was 11th grade Physics. A girl had missed most of the previous week but none of us really knew why. The teacher asked us to get one of the handouts/study guides out and she raised her hand and said she didn't have one. My friend (jokingly) goes "Well maybe you shouldn't have been absent last week!" and she immediately snaps back with, "Maybe I should have asked my dad not to die last week." Oh the tension in the room. You could cut that shit with those shitty crayola scissors.
Reddit, what is the worst secret your SO is keeping from you, but that you actually know?	After we found out he was diagnosed with lung cancer he began disappearing for long periods of time and making excuses about how he was going for walks or even smoking Marijuana. He was supposedly getting the money to pay for his cancer treatment from two old friends. After I found out he had a second cell phone and he refused to take the money from his friends I knew something was up. I now know he has been cooking crystal meth to pay for his treatment.	The first time my SO and I slept together I woke up during the night to use the bathroom. I came back in the room and she farted one of the loudest farts I've ever heard. I started laughing like crazy and she almost woke up. Almost. We've been together for seven years.
What is the worst thing you ever said to someone?	I called my ex a cunt and told her good luck with the eating disorder. It was the last thing I said to her and I don't really feel to bad about it either.	My philosophy teacher once jokingly asked a girl who came late to class "Look who's back from the dead" She had just returned from a funeral out of town for her grandfather and he knew about it too.
Wedding photographers of Reddit: can you tell if a couple is going to last or not? If so, how?	I was at this wedding one time, and I knew things wouldn't go down so well once I heard the couple's most hated song play from the balcony. Pretty soon the host and his friends fired several crossbow bolts into all the guests before finishing off the man of honor with a sword stab. Then they killed his wife, and then his mother, and his pet dog. It was a mess.	I have an album of photos of my now ex-husband glaring at me. It'd be difficult for the photographer to have *not* noticed.
What movie is so indicative of its time that it doesn't hold up well?	All the Dirty Harry movies. Dirty Harry 1 in particular with the villain based on the Zodiac Killer, all the casual racism and homophobia and the fact that the .44 magnum hasn't been the most powerful handgun in a long time.	Birth of a nation. Something about the whole glorifying the klan thing makes me think of it as so early 1900's.
My girlfriend's coworker honestly believes a 'solar charger' app on her phone is charging it. What stories do you have of people that are too stupid to use technology?	I hate the phrase too stupid too use technology. Just because someone isn't tech wizard like a lot of the people here on reddit, suddenly they're too 'dumb' to even own it? /Sorry. It's just a phrase that gets my goat.	Once my grandma said that she wasn't going to turn on her computer for the entire day because she heard a virus was being released that afternoon.
Historians of Reddit, what misconception about history drives you nuts?	That Nazi Germany and fascism was evil (and they were) but somehow Communism was great for the folks. Nazi Germany was responsible for the deaths of 10 million+ people which is horrific however Communism in the Soviet Union and China is responsible for 100 million deaths. Both are evil ideologies but Communism is many times worse.	Gavrilo Princip did not "just happen to be having a sandwich" when the Archduke drove by. Gavrilo chose that deli to wait for another chance *specifically because* it was along the original parade path that the Archduke was meant to take through Sarajevo that day. Unbeknownst to Princip, the Archduke changed his plans and decided to head to the hospital to visit the civilians injured in the initial assassination attempts. The Archduke's driver was some Austrian guy who didn't know Sarajevo, and ended up following the original parade route by mistake. Gavrilo was waiting along the parade route, *hoping for this exact situation.* Yes the whole thing was still highly coincidental, but Gavrilo wasn't there for just a sandwich.
I'm a bridesmaid in an upcoming wedding. Without asking the bride, I cut off all my hair - which in turn made her very upset because I didn't ask her permission. Does anyone have any Bridezilla stories?	Not the bride, but bitchy nonetheless. I went with the bride and 7 other bridesmaids to pick out our gowns for the wedding. We all pick out the dresses, find our size, and try them on. Now, I have a pretty huge back tattoo and it hangs way out of the dress. The woman that worked at the bridal store had the audacity to pull me aside and ask if I would like to look at shawls to cover it. No, woman, I do not. The bride knows I have a back piece, does not care, therefore- I do not care.	I knew a woman who was a bridesmaid in a relatives wedding. She was married and had been trying to get pregnant for a while. Finally, her and her hubby got lucky and she conceived. The bridezilla got furious and kicked her out of the wedding because she would be pregant in the pictures. 3 months later, sadly, the woman miscarried. The bride called her with a response along the lines of "good, well now you can be back in the wedding." Needless to say, she did nto even attend it.
How did your parents fuck you up?	Didn't let me struggle with adversity enough as a youth, where mistakes didn't matter too much. Sure, being spoiled and getting bailed out of trouble was great at the time. Now I've had to learn how to have a good work ethic and fight for what I want, when mistakes are much more costly	They didn't show (or probably even have) any sort of emotions, so now I have the emotional intelligence of an aubergine. :(
What is your favorite TV show conspiracy/fan theory?	Walter actually died in the car he was sitting in in the last season. Everything that happened from that point forward is just in his head.	Kramer had connections to the mafia, Robert "bob" Sacamano in particular. This is why he had never worried about money, had a gambling problem and had so many hook ups.
What's your greatest 'hold my beer' moment?	I was at a party talking to my friend about how he should live life to its fullest and take every advantage he can with girls, when I spot the girl I was dating across the room engaged in conversation with a group. I say 'hold my beer' to my friend and walk over. I grab her around the waist, turn to the group and say ' would you mind if I borrow her for a moment?' and lead her outside. Then we walk over to my car and have amazing sex. The awesome spontaneous sex, accompanied with the looks I got from the group (several dudes obviously wanting to get with my chick) made me feel like a boss.	Leaning on a railing. Railing gives out, extend hand in hope that air can suddenly solidify into something I can grab on to. Friend reaches out to me... only grabs beer out of my hand. I fall to the ground. Didn't spill my beer.
What's your favorite unsolved mystery?	My household is currently investigating the mystery of the long list of phone sex line calls... We called in the Hardy brothers, but they just got clue goo everywhere and made the situation worse. The second part was a lie, but the mystery is legit.	In 1999, a young lady died in a car accident on a freeway in Los Angeles. Shortly after she died of blunt force trauma, her car caught on fire and 99% of her body and everything combustible inside the car burned. The police traced the car to an address, but the man there never claimed her or identified her. To this day, she is a Jane Doe. It'll be 13 years this November. I'm doing research on this for fun, as a volunteer. It just baffles me how she vanished and no one noticed.
What is your secret to falling asleep?	* Wake up at 4:00am * Gym for 1 1/4 hours * Shower * Work from 7:30 am to 4:00 pm * Home at 5:00 pm * Play with daughter for 2 hours * Dinner * Shower * TV till 10:00 pm Trust me falling asleep isn't an issue.	I start daydreaming. I put myself into crazy scenarios that would only ever happen in dreams. Like fighting in a medieval battle or being president, whatever. It always makes me fall asleep. I guess I just slip right into a dreaming state.
What Are You Banned From and Why?	I got banned off a Christian fundamentalist Facebook page for calling Jesus a cunt. Although, in hindsight, I would've preferred to quote Bronn from Game of Thrones: "there's no cure for being a cunt."	A local card and comic store, for causing a grown, 40-45 year old man to flip a table and storm out of said establishment after he lost a game of cards. Apparently, when the man making the scene spends tons of money in the store, he can do no wrong.
What are some of the dumbest rules you had in school?	Not being allowed to chew gum. What, were they afraid we would be so focused on chewing that the lesson would be lost on us?	We couldn't say bullets when talking about making a list in a word document, instead we had to say nuggets
What family member do you like least? And why?	A family member who voted for Trump and then lost his farming job due to China cutting back buying soybeans...and he still supports the Orange Moron. Enjoy being poor in the Minnesota, bud!	My father. He is narcissistic, self absorbed, a liar, a cheater... His self worth relies solely on how he can out do his own adult children. He changes history at his whim to validate his delusions. I "followed" his steps and became a Marine. Then I figured out his stories were pure bullshit lies. He has no honor. He has no self respect. He has nothing but a poorly crafted web of lies. Even if he saw this post, he would never think it was about him.
What is the worst movie you have ever seen?	Bad Grandpa, i knew how it was gonna be but majority rules, the group I was with insisted in watching it	Since no one has mentioned it. Foodfight. There are countless reviews on YouTube, but to summarize, the story is weird, the writing is horrible, full of innuendos and bad puns, the character design is hideous and the animation is absolutely horrendous, like they realized somewhere how terrible it was going and decided to not give any fucks. Worst animated film I've seen in my life, easily. Some people classify it as a fetish movie in disguise. For some reason, it stars a bunch of famous actors like Charlie Sheen and Hillary Duff.
What did your favorite teacher do that made you love them?	No ones gonna state the obvious? Ok I will. My favorite teacher was because she was just out of college she was a 10/10 and in a horny teenage kids brain that made her a 100/10 considering I woulda fucked anything with a pulse at that age. That’s why she was my favorite teacher.	My Pre-Calc teacher always wanted to make sure we understood the material and encouraged us to ask questions. He also let us make up tests that we failed on. He was less concerned with us getting A's and B's and more about making sure we understood and applied the material.
What are some customs we stick to in society even though they make no sense?	Saying bless you for sneezing. Seriously, there no point in it. We're not really expelling any demons from our system.	In school, teacher saying "it doesn't matter who started it.". YES IT FUCKING DOES! HOW COULD IT NOT?! It always matters who instigated and caused the situation! Btw, I know it matters how the other person (or anything) reacts. I'm just saying that it matters how it started.
Employers of Reddit, what is the most scandalous thing you have ever encountered during a background check of an applicant?	I was browsing the local "Megan's Law" website (as I recommend that all parents do) and stumbled upon the picture of a guy we had hired on about 6 months ago.It turns out he had been convicted of sexual assault of a child. The next day I went to our HR person and showed her the picture/ web site. We agreed that he shouldn't be working as a salesman for us. Immediately terminated.	I was interviewing a guy for a manager position and was planning on hiring him, mentioned that he'd have to do a background check. Straight out said he would not pass because of an armed robbery and assault charge. Seemed like a normal guy to me.
Hey Jews of Reddit: What did you do today?	You know, there are a lot of people/other religions that don't celebrate Christmas OP. Not only Jews. Edit: not offended, I'm actually Christian. OP's wording sounded dumb. The whole question is dumb! It's pretty much like any other holiday.	Like all of my people, I went out for Chinese food. I believe this is encouraged in the Old Testament.
Grown-Ass Men of Reddit- What scares the living shit out of you?	White American male who is over 6 ft tall checking in... I'm afraid of the police, and large groups of ghetto black people. That's pretty much it. I consider myself very lucky	That I might never find out what I really, truly want from life. That my days go down the drain, without me finding out who I really am, or was. I don't want to end up as nothing, and the possibilty makes me choke. I'm alright.
What are some tips you'd give to someone living alone for the first time?	enjoy it. It's the only time you will ever be free. You go from living at home with parents and rules to eventually living with a SO and rules.	You don't eat as much as you think. Cooking for 1 can be difficult at times. Turn off the lights! Hide, or give to a trusted friend, a key. You will lock yourself out of your place somehow and more than likely you will be in your underwear.
Is there a way to see how many viewers TBS loses when a Tyler Perry show comes on?	In this thread: Rich white people who can't seem to comprehend other people might like other things that are specifically tailored to them.	They obviously don't go down because if he didn't have such a large viewer-base, how would he get to make so many shows/movies?
Girls of reddit, what's something guys think they do sneakily but you always notice?	Attempting to flirt with you and when you're like hell no, they get all all "o haha I was joking." Word. It's not working.	Buy gifts. My husband is as subtle as an elephant walking through a small windchime shop. I don't know if it's just him, but if he's excited about something he just can't keep a secret. He'll "hint" at it in ways that make it glaringly obvious what is coming.
Tattoo artists, what's the most disturbing request you have had?	I don't have a story yet but I want to be a tattooist/piercer. I was with my bf while he got his tattoo and this guy comes in. They start talkin askin what he wants to get done and the guy says " idk really, I just got paid and some spare time on my hands and figured I could get a tattoo" he then said he would come back later. I seriousley cannot fathom the idea that people just get a permanent picture on their body because they are bored and have money. I would never tattoo anyone without a good reason.	My tattoo guy told me that he had a fifteen year old boy come in, wanting a swastika on his neck. He told him he only did underage tattoos with parental permission to get him out of the shop. Two hours later the kid's back with his parents and they say "just give him the tattoo, he'll whine if we don't allow it." He told them all to get out.
German, Italian, and Japanese redditors, how was World War II taught to you in school?	In Japan, i learned that the United States refused to give us food, so we bombed them. Then they and China attacked us and won :(	German here. I remember being taught about the war crimes at a young age. That shit sticks with you. It's very taboo in Germany to do a Hitler Salute, print swastika's, etc.
What's the best advice you've ever received for making a sandwich better?	Leave the mayonnaise at the grocery store and never let it touch your sandwich. And for the love of god, use real butter. Real. Do not use margarine. Ever.	My dad was a cook around Philly for a while. He would make Italian subs where the meat was used to tuck the lettuce, onion, tomato, cheese into the roll so when you bit it, nothing moved around. Btw life pro tip: study the food fat guys make for themselves.
Casino employees of reddit, what are some things we're not supposed to know about how the house operates?	I'm not a casino worker, but I do occasionally visit a family member who lives in Las Vegas, a short drive from the Strip. The casinos are made without windows, and don't have clocks located near them. Apparently the atmosphere is also made to keep people playing. Those places really seem to be designed to distort someones perception of time, and would've given Odysseus a headache compared to what he had to do when his men fell victim to the Lotus Eaters.	Slot machine jingles are written in the key of C to keep players happy, and to keep different machines from playing discordant tunes against other machines
What is the worst example of 'rich people problems' you have seen?	Feminists in first world countries thinking that they are oppressed when they have a far high standard of living than the vast majority of people in the world.	My rich friend has had to respray his car multiple times because a peacock on his land keeps seeing his reflection in it and attacking it like crazy Edit: thanks for the gold! I'll let my friend know it wasn't all in vain
What's something you found out about your S.O years into the relationship that made you reevaluate the whole relationship?	It was 2016 and out of all the Republican candidates he chose trump. Not towards the end when the selection pool was small oh no, towards the beginning when there were about 17 candidates. That was...well, something else.	9 months into the relationship I found out he had a court date. He told me it was for assaulting a bouncer. Very soon after his mother admitted that he has a court date for assaulting his underage relative. When I confronted him he said that the underage girl raped him. When I told him he was full of s***, he said, okay she gave me a bj. Soon after, I went into his lawyer's office with him and read the transcript. It turns out he raped his underage niece twice, and just tells a different lie to anyone who asks him why he's in jail. Total piece of s***. I ran very fast. Haven't seen him since, and hope I will never see him again.
At what point do you stop watching/listening to an artist because of their actions or views?	I recently stopped watching the NFL. It's become so political. This has been an ongoing problem that started long before Kaepernick and the whole anthem issue. I enjoyed the whole larger than life aspect of the NFL and the players, this has been ruined. Its not as fun to watch anymore and has lost its luster to me personally.	Well, kind of had to stop listening to Lostprophets after Ian Watkins became a paedophile and had his computer password as "irapekids"
How are you passive aggressive?	I've perfected the art of blocking other cars from passing by boxing them in, but while also looking oblivious at the same time. You can't let them know you're purposefully causing them trouble, but you have to be hyper-aware of the other cars you're using to create a blockade. I do this to everyone I can to make my commute more fun. It's great to see people get heated in traffic, but not direct their anger toward you. Such a satisfying feeling	A coworker complained about me to another coworker about how I need to be more friendly because I happened to not see her walking behind me and say hello one day (wtf? shouldn't she have said hello to me if she were behind me?). I have to walk past that coworker's desk to get anywhere in the office so now I make it a point to say hello every time I pass her. You're on the phone? HELLO COWORKER! Talking to a colleague at your desk? HELLO COWORKER! Looking really stressed out because you have a deadline and you're bad at time management? HELLO COWORKER! Trying to take a dump in the restroom? HELLO COWORKER! She's really irritated but hasn't told me to stop yet because she knows she brought this upon herself.
Why do you hate your name?	"Where's your pumpkin spice?". Being blonde dosent help. However? They discount my intelegence, and speak freely around me. If i so chose I could ruin everybody around me...	because my first name is so common, I went to school with 6 others by my first name, hate it For those curious: Chris
What's the most ridiculous thing you've heard someone state as if it were true?	"The rule of thumb is that you can beat a woman with a branch [or stick] no thicker than your thumb."	This old coworker of mine would constantly lie trying to impress everyone. He once told us his body fat percentage was negative. We googled what that was and a skeleton showed up.
People who have visited America, what baffled you the most?	You are all being fucked sideways by your healthcare system, yet you seem okay with that! American fighting spirit seems to follow the French school of thought	My uncle visited from the Middle East for the first time ever about 5 years ago. We took him to a golden corral(restaurant chain). He could not believe how big it was! All he wanted to do was eat there lol I wanted to show him lakes, forests, take him to the city...nope..."let's Goto the buffet" lol
[Serious] Men who grew a beard after being clean-shaven for a long time, does it make a difference in your life and the way people treat you?	People don't fuck with me. I feel like I get more respect out in public and can walk confidently in some of the worser areas of town. I was full duckhunter for a while but now I keep it around an inch.	Beardless on tinder/okcupid - one date in a year. Bearded on the same sites, around 30 dates in 18 months. Yes it's made a hell of a difference.
Creepy situation with co-worker, what are my options?	He sounds like he is going to rape and kill you ritualistically....so I'd take steps to prevent that...like a restraining order...and a gun	In addition to what others recommend, I suggest letting your kids' school know about this. Give them a description of the guy as well as all the information you can about his vehicle. Let them know that he does not have permission to pick up, or be around your kids.
Out of kindness, I gave a woman who was begging for food for her children something to eat at my restaurant for free. Then she came back for more with complaints. What is the worst way someone has taken advantage of your kindness?	Welcome to life. It doesn't matter what you do for someone, whether it be a complete stranger or your best friend, everybody only cares about themselves.	I was sitting in a Wendys parking lot waiting for my fries to come out. A lady walks up to my window and I slightly crack it. She starts giving me a sob story about having 5 kids to feed, meanwhile there are no children anywhere. I had a dollar and some change leftover from the Wendys purchase, so I gave that to her. She looks at it, looks at me, and says, "What, you aint got no 20??!" Without hesitating I replied, "No, but I can give you 5 in the eye." She walked away yelling and cussing like a crazy homeless person does. I'm not usually that mean, or that creative. I was both proud and horrified at myself.
Those who went too far during their bachelor/bachelorette party, what happened and do you regret it now that your married?	I got to rub some boobies and get grinded on by some strippers. If I'm supposed to regret that, I don't. And no, I don't believe that's "too far," but some might, so there ya go.	Not super relevant but my best man fell down some steps at a strip club and somehow got his foot stuck under something. Another groomsman 'helped' him up and broke his ankle in the process. It was black the next day and he was on crutches for the wedding 4 weeks later.
Attractive Teachers of reddit, did you know which students had a crush on you, and what is the strangest or most inappropriate thing you overheard said about you?	One time a student tried to touch my ass while I was passing through my class.I didn't think I was that hot in the first place so I was pleasantly surprised.Being a young male in heat,it is really hard to hold on to your urges so I didn't think much of it.Aside from that as a cool male teacher,it is my job to forgive my students and lead them to the path of greatness.	French teacher here. Teenagers are just constantly inappropriate and need very little encouragement- I got asked to prom, had boys tell other teachers that they thought I was hot, had a parent accusingly tell me that she now understood why her son loved French, which I took to mean that my innovative skill set had inspired him... I didn't mind though, it meant that I had a class with 12 previously disengaged 16 year old boys come back for extra homework and revision classes every lunch time and after school and every one of those bags of hormones passed.
What's a good joke that'll get a 6 yr old giggling?	hold a puppy or a kitty and make up a cute voice and say: knock knock kid : whose there beetle kid : beetle who beetle lil love into me AND THEN SMOOSH THE PUPPY/KITTY INTO HIS FACE edit : if you want to downvote, could you care to explain why?	Call it "Squarebob Spongepants" with a straight face and keep repeating it no matter how many times they correct you.
What is a male/female double standard that really drives you crazy?	" Hillary Clinton is a female so as a female I am supporting Hillary!" " you are a man supporting another man at all? You are misogynistic!" Talk about blindly stupid and massively ignorant!	Stay at home dads (or even those who take paternity leaves), especially when some of them are just working remotely
What are the didgeridoo's and didgeridon'ts when visiting Australia?	Try to avoid flying Qantas ( The Australian National Airline). The stewardesses have a rather subtle way of letting the the tourists know that they are not quite thrilled about seeing them.	* The water is trying to kill you (swim between the flags) * The wildlife is trying to kill you (stay out of grassy areas) * The sun is trying to kill you (wear a hat and sunblock at all times)
Redditors who survived or were close to a big terror attack (9/11/ columbine shooting/...), how do you feel about all these memes out there about terror in general?	I don't care much. Some jokes kinda sting. But some are OK. I don't get offended by jokes much. But If its particularly over the top it might bother me a bit.	Didnt really survive a lone "terrorist attack" or anything but I am a Vietnam veteran and I know its very popular these days for kids to say anything fidgety is someone having a "Vietnam flashback" as we are all stereotyped to be PTSD ridden crazies. Overall, I have no problem with good humored fun, especially among naive kids. I dont like how it promotes the stereotype all Vietnam vets are PTSD ridden crazies but it is what it is. The biggest thing is just know when not to joke about it. If an actual Vietnam veteran is in the room maybe refrain from making "flashback" jokes. Id hope not joking about a traumatic event in front of someone who experiences it is just common knowledge though. But it seems like some people are socially inept these days so Im just putting that out there.
Brazilian Resident Redditors, now that the World Cup is over, what is your current report on the locations where the games took place, the condos, the stadiums, etc. ?	Almost an hour. Has 30 upvotes from curious redditors, but no comments. They must still be mourning. Edit: This was so weird. There were zero comments before I commented. Nobody commented for a whole hour. That is some serious self-control that I've never seen on AskReddit before.	There was a fuckton of police officers in my city (Curitiba). By a fuckton I mean at least 2 on every corner. On game days there would be 8 or 9 at every fucking corner on at least a 1/2 mile radius around the stadium. I mean, I didn't even know our state had so many police officers. Two or three times I saw like a whole riot squad (no shields or anything, just wearing helmets) downtown. Just walking around, on patrol I guess. But anyway, life is back to normal right now. We're damn happy that everything worked out kinda fine. And the stadium here has been in use since the end of the cup for the Brazilian Club League. Idk what do you mean by "the condos". Hotels weren't even near full capacity here.
What's something minor that enrages you much more than it actually should?	I can’t stand when people finish their cereal and then drink the milk by sipping from the bowl. I understand that they’re not letting the milk go to waste and that’s great but it just enraged me for some reason. I’m getting pissed off just writing this. Unless of course they were eating some chocolate cereal that turned the milk to chocolate milk, then it’s fine	Those mobile ads that always seem to load right when you tap the screen so you tap the ad instead of what you were trying to tap.
What's your strictest personal rule?	AM and PM are for people who can't count past 12. There are 24 hours in the day. That is how the time should be noted. It is not 3 anything right now (here). It is 15:15.	I make it to every single birthday I possibly can. If a person took the time and thought to invite me, I'm making it if at all possible. No "eh, I'm not feeling it tonight", no "I don't know anyone", and no "I'll stay for a little while." Anybody who's ever had a party where only 3-5 people show up will understand why.
How do you make money on the side ?	Not money, necessarily.. But whilst I was studying my undergraduate degree I worked on a paper (outside of uni) which was published, I'm now doing my PhD and working on another. I believe that working on side projects, gaining experience and networking will pay dividends later.	Bartending weddings and handyman work. If you have any type of skills around the house, you can do quite well. While in-between jobs, I put out fliers in the parking lot of a Lowes in an upscale area. I was making like $500-600/week just installing fans, swapping faucets, installing some mouldings, etc. As long as you show up, give a fair price and do good work, people will pass your name along. Shit it's been 3 years since I put fliers out and I still get random calls to do odd jobs
What steps have you taken to appear more intelligent than you are?	For English speakers and writers: do your best to avoid passive voice; write and speak in active voice when you can. Passive: The dog is running after the Frisbee Active: The dog runs after the Frisbee Active voice demands a better vocabulary, because one must use a verb instead of "is/are/has". Bonus for writing: Learn how to use, but not overuse, the semi-colon and long (a/k/a em) dash.	I've learned that people listen more and actually take me seriously when I talk slower. If you're answering a question, or having a conversation, take a pause before you speak.
[Serious] What is the creepiest confession / most disturbing that you have heard from an otherwise normal person?	When I was 18, I worked in the juniors section at Kohl's. This tiny old man came up to me and said softly, "Please don't freak out, but I need a dress. For myself." I replied, "Well, you don't really have anything here" -gesturing to my boobs- "so we'll have to find something that doesn't rely on that to look cute." I found him a few dresses. He tried them on in the dressing room. (I insisted he use the gender appropriate dressing room for the sake of any junior that might see him.) He thanked me for my professionalism and left. Then, I went home and completely freaked out because I am good during the stressful situation and then panic when it is over.	I used to help out at a nursing home. This old Russian lady would relate the same tale over and over. Her husband drank and hit her. It was sad for sure. But one day she leaned over and whispered "he was asshole drunk, so I pushed him down stairs. Dead."
What isn't as good as everyone remembers due to nostalgia?	Star Wars: Battlefront 2. If you go back and play it you'll realize how empty and boring a lot of the maps were and how OP the heroes were.	The spy kids movie. As a kid everything looked so real and was so cool. Watched it the other week and it was some of the worst effects I've ever seen.
I want to make sure my computer is running on top form. Can you tell me what I can do to do so?	Easy... Download a linux distro (ubuntu is user friendly) and get rid of windows crap and start booting up with linux... Easy as that	First step: add legs. Next: remove all the crapware that the manufacturer installed. then remove all the crapware you installed that you don't use. after that, go into MSCONFIG and stop everything from starting that you a) know what it is and b) don't need it to be running when you turn on your computer. don't mess with the registry (registry cleaners are bullshit). you may also be able to add memory or get a faster hard drive to boost the hardware too.
Photographers of reddit, what's the weirdest event or session that you've had to photograph?	I'm not a photographer, but I work on a team of people including photags who shoot High School yearbook and senior photos. Some of the names parents are giving their kids these days are mindblowing. Examples: Amarica (f), Mister (m), various incorrect spellings of Michaela (mickayla, makaela, mckayla, etc...), Imunique, and a co-worker of mine swears she actually had a La-a (pronounced ladasha).	I was hired once to photograph an elephant that was about a week away from giving birth. That in itself was anything but weird; it was great fun, and a rare and beautiful privilege. What did weird me out a bit was seeing the photos made into ads for a multinational grocery chain for some kind of Mother's Day promotion. Because of course, if there's any mental image that every mother wants their kids to have in their heads when they're out buying food and thinking of mom, it's of a heavily pregnant elephant.
Tattoo artists of Reddit, what's the worst tattoo you've tried to talk someone out of, but they insisted you give it to them anyways?	Obligatory not a tattoo artist, but I asked this same question to Tanner from Ink Machine in Lincoln Nebraska, and he aid it's always people's names on the neck, and on knuckles..ect.	I stopped tattooing years ago, but one of the last ones was just above this guy's dick. He wanted "Lisa's" written above, and sort of arched over his penis. He also wanted the dot on the "i" to be a yin yang. Midway through the tattoo I find out he's not even dating this girl and he thought he'd get it as some kind of surprise or something. Take this from me, no matter how much you like him/her and how stable/happy/long your relationship has been: do not get any *living* person's name on your body. (or portrait unless you're feeling ironic)
Have you ever ate at a restaurant and have been unable to pay the bill afterwards? What happened?	I was in Prague a couple years ago and my boyfriend and I were trying out a new bar, but we didn't realize that it was cash only and we were short by a few bucks. Ended up stacking a bunch of coins on the table and slipping US coins into it and bolting before the waitress came back :/	Card was declined at a local sushi place because somebody tried to use it 15+ hours away from me(found this out later when I checked my missed calls). Was extremely embarrassed because I was on a date and knew I wouldn't get my next paycheck until 2 days after that. Waiter called over the manager who recognized me as a regular(been there at least 30 times) and said to not worry about it. I felt bad about it so when I got my paycheck I went back and paid the bill + left a nice tip for our waiter.
What total dick move did you experience?	Watched Hilary Clinton fuck over Bernie Sanders in the DNC. Shame - if Bernie had gotten the nom, the dems likely would have the presidency right now	My college roommates planned an entire night out together at our favorite bar and didn't tell me until they were about to leave.. when they asked me for a ride there
What is a sign of a well-raised and level headed teenager?	Good grades without too many hours of study. No cuss words. Proficiency in a wide variety of hobbies and sports. They love anime.	It's true for anyone, just generally more obvious for teenagers - catering your manners and language to your environment. You can dress, speak, and act any way you want on your own and I'll never look down on you if you can clean up a little and speak maturely when the situation calls for it.
What took you far too long to figure out?	Newton's First and Third laws. What do you mean an object that is put in motion will continue that motion? What about the air resistance and friction? What do you mean when one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction? If you kick a ball, it doesn't kick you back, it flies away. Only later I realized the laws apply to the High School Physics Textbook Land where most natural forces either does not exist or is completely ignored, and which features things like perfect gases, ideal blacks, and point-sized masses.	Electric toothbrush stopped on me this morning, just made this choking sound and sputtered out. I was fucking livid, I had this mouth full of toothpaste still and my toothbrush gives up on life on me. For a solid thirty seconds I just sat there fuming and ranting in my head... Until I realized an electric toothbrush - electricity = a regular fucking toothbrush
People of Reddit, What do a lot of people do currently that will turn out to be really unhealthy in a few decades?	Social media is a cancer on society that has already ruined 3/4 of all the female millenials. Scared for the future	I don't move nearly as much as I should. I sit all day at work. I sit in the car/on the train. I walk into my house. I sit on my bed. I sleep. Shit, I really should start moving more.
People of Reddit who have lived a double life: how did you get there and what happened?	Well, there was a support group for men with testicular cancer. The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob. Bob had bitch tits. Wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.	I have a name that's unpronounceable to most Americans. In elemntary school instead of listening to them mangle my name, I decided to choose a random English name to go by while in the States. Quite a lot of foreigners do this. A year came and went, and now I was in a new class with new teachers and new classmates. I decided on a whim to choose a different name to go by that year. I've been doing it every time I'm in a new social circle since then. I can tell when and where I met someone by what they call me.
I just bought a wheelchair accessible van for my daughter for a dollar. What things have strangers done for you that have restored your faith in humanity?	One time my car broke down and I was stuck on the side of the road, a mexican gentleman stopped to help, when i offered payment for the job he had done he simply replied, "no no, today you, tomorrow me" in broken english	When my family fled north from hurricane Katrina, ran into a guy in the middle of the night at a gas station that offered us his guest house as all hotels were booked anywhere north of the coast for hundreds of miles. Turns out he is loaded, and his guest house is posh. Big screen, hot tub, works. Tells us to come by this restaurant the next day, and he feeds the whole family and comps the bill. Turns out he owns the restaurant. So we stayed there a couple nights and this guys is just over the top nice. Wouldn't take anything. Tl;dr- rich stranger shelters my family during Katrina EDIT: the restaurant is Trailboss in Macon, MS
What was your "I have to quit my job" moment?	The previous day, I sorted toothbrushes for eight hours straight. I decided against going in the next day on the grounds of "I'm better than that".	When I was 19, I worked at a little coffee-shop. It was just me and this other guy. He was 40 years old. At first he seemed nice, but after a while.. ALL he talked about was sex. He told me in detail about his conquests from last night, how they did it, where they did it and so on. It was like he tried to impress me. Then he started to invite me home to his place, to smoke weed and "hang out". At this time I had a boyfriend, and he knew about him. I declined his offer, every time, but he did not stop. Then one day he could not stop talking about how horny he was. After a while he said "I think I´m gonna lock the door and f**k you behind the counter" I quit that day.
I pay the same price for Netflix as I do for Hulu. Why don't I have to sit through ads on Netflix like I do on Hulu?	I have Hulu Plus, and there is only one small Ad in the beginning.... Not that big of a deal.	On netfilx, you have to wait to see new shows. The latest I've found for a show is the previous season. I have both in my apartment because its still cheaper than cable.
What piece of advice would you give the teenagers of today?	The STEM circlejerk exists for a reason. If you insist to go to art school, use your time there to learn something artsy that is also technical (like architecture, or 3d modling).	If someone fucks you over or lies big time they'll do it again, even if you're a good person to them.
Suppose I am in a line of a few cars (say 5), driving on the highway in the left lane. All are traveling 15 mph over the posted speed limit. If we pass a speed trap, which position in the line is more likely to get stopped by the police?	I WAS the first car, in the left lane speeding past a cop. There was only one other guy following me and he had been for some time. As soon as we passed the cop, I got into the right lane, slowed way down and was prepared to be pulled over. To my surprise, the cop pulled over the guy behind me instead. I should note that the guy behind me was a cunt! he was one of those people who want to pass you, even if you're going quite fast, just for the fuck of it! He was riding my ass a lot of the time, so when the cop pulled him over instead, I was quite content. This happened about a year ago, on I-75 North around Bradenton, FL. We were going about 95 in a 70. If you were the guy, haha and fuck you!	From a good friend of mine who is a cop: we just throw the lights on and take whoever stops first. You're all over-thinking it.
If you could write any HBO-quality television series, what would it be about?	A Star Trek show (PRE FUCKING REBOOT) about a temporal war. That is, Federation around the 30th century trying to prevent an enemy from changing the past. Star Trek:Enterprise tried to do it but like most things it did, it failed miserably.	A show about what happens when a technological utopia is reached and everybody has their own personal heaven, but our main character is bored and too boring to know what to do with his infinite life, so he wanders from place to place to find his purpose, but is mostly bombarded by people who've gone wild with their personal heavens. Every reality is possible and an utterly ordinary man lives through these realities, such as a psychotic rendition of a Game of Thrones world, a pop culture utopia where trends change in minutes, literally, and a place run by a puzzle-obsessed autistic person who only allows people to leave once they've completed his gauntlet.
Reddit, what's the most attractive non-sexual thing a girl can do in public?	Have an intelligent conversation with me if I choose to talk to you. Don't make arrogant assumptions that every man that talks to you is trying to take you home, that shit makes you ugly real fast. **EDIT**: I certainly did not mean "if I choose to talk to you" to mean "if I give you the privilege of speaking to wonderful me". I just meant, please don't automatically assume I'm trying to take you home if we're having a chat.	Based on the comments here so far, I think tomorrow I'm going to go read Game of Thrones at a coffee shop. Every once in awhile, I'll look up, smile, and bite my lip. I'm expecting fifty marriage proposals before I leave said coffee shop. Thanks boys.
Is anyone else really bummed about not being alive in the future to explore galaxies and the universe? What impossibility bums you out Reddit?	Superpowers. Including ones that'll let me mess with people. I've already formed a plan for shapeshifting. I'll shift into a beautiful large breasted woman. I will take pictures of myself to fap to later. After that's done, I'll do a one-night stand with a homophobic douchebag and just as he sees me naked, I'll cockslap him with the 3 ft. long hard dick I just got and laugh as he runs away. Then I would masturbate with a vagina because I'm curious about how that feels.	The fact that I will never ever be able to know if my future kids will succeed in life. My whole family died extremely early. My mom died at the age of 54. Oldest grandparent became 66.
What is the most blatant act of "I don't care who this hurts so long as it benefits me" you've seen from your boss/higher up?	There was a secretary that seriously compromised classified materials by using her own personal server for email. Nothing happened to her and I think she's getting a promotion soon.	A job I had a few years back - A co-worker of mine was about to buy a house.. was telling us (boss included) about the great price he got. Just waiting for the bank to finalize the paperwork. Turns out he didnt get a buy/sell agreement and my boss swooped in and paid cash for it. He then tried selling it back to my co-worker for a profit. He told my boss to go fuck himself and about 5 guys walked out of work that day. Fuck that guy.
I take my chickens for bike rides. I was wondering if they actually enjoy rides or not? also, what are some of the weird things you do with your pets?	My cat needs to sleep in her bed in the bathroom with door closed, at 9:00 pm she always goes where I'm at and starts meowing so I have to go upstairs and make her company while she's eating but I have to be brushing my teeth, then I close the bathroom door and she goes to sleep. Since she was a kitty I make her dance "Single ladies" also I make her fly (not by trowing her) I carry her in the air while I run, she enjoys it.	We have a parrot and he likes going for rides in the car, BUT he has to be able to see out the window or else he gets mad.
I was piss drunk and fell into a pond of duck shit (story inside). Now... what are your most WTF drunk and or high stories?	I dunno. I've done so much stupid shit when I'm drunk. I flipped a motorcycle into a brick wall once. That's if you consider a Honda CB400 a motorcycle, that is. Before I did that I almost put it through a picture window hosting a perfect Norman Rockwell family. Bent the fuck out the forks and front rim. I never got a DUI on a motorcycle. I honestly think the police secretly hoped I'd die. It would have made their lives _so_ much simpler.	I have no clue who would bury such a promising story discussion post, this has potential. Alright, here's my story, it's rather short: After a heavy night of drinking, I walked up to a fully uniformed and on duty police officer next to his car, put my hand on his shoulder, looked around then to him, and said completely seriously: "Hey, you gotta tell me if you're a cop right?" After that I puked on his uniform, keeled over, hit my head on his car, and blacked out. The cop did what was possibly the safest thing for me and brought me to the police station where I stayed overnight. All of this is from account of the officer. I barely remember shit.
When I studied abroad in Italy, I found a pizzeria in Venice that advertised "American style pizza." Turns out it was a pizza that was COVERED in french fries. What funny ideas have you seen about America from other countries?	I've said it for years: screw Italy, New York and Chicago are the only places with the right to call themselves the home of pizza.	I was an exchange student in Japan. Someone told my host family that American kids drink tons of milk. When I arrived at their house, they showed me their fridge filled with "Sno" brand milk. They had also bought me yogurt and ice cream to make me feel at home. I'm lactose intolerant.
What are your shameful masturbation habits?	I (as a girl and self proclaimed feminist) watch the worst woman disgracing porn, no violent stuff but very objectifying. Weird phantasies I like to watch and that turn me on, but I don't want to come true, some things should stay a fantasy.. And I have huge phantasies with my prof. which always make me cum.	I have to have my legs straight. It's really weird, but I can't finish unless I can straighten out my legs and tense up.
In life, what has been your greatest WTF moment?	i say wtf all the time when i remember that i have an auto immune disorder called pyoderma gangrenosum got scars from it now too	Driving back into my neiborhood at 4pm on a Sunday see a guy in a camo jacket jacket and a mid length graying beard probably in his 40's walking up the road. Notice he is carrying some weird long black thing. As I get closer and drive past I can see that he is casually walking down the street with a 2 foot long black dildo, when I got home I watched him walk to the edge of the road which comes to a dead end and just turn around at the very end to walk back up. The guy was just going for an afternoon stroll with his dildo.
Teachers of Reddit: What is the most interesting / disturbing thing you've ever confiscated from a student?	My teacher in 5th grade took my scissors... i used to like doing kirigami and was always way ahead of the class...	A live piglet. We'd been on a field trip to the petting zoo/farm, and a student smuggled the piglet back in his coat.
Introverts of reddit, how do you feel when you’re with a group of extroverts?	I feel a bit sorry for them. As an introvert I'm used to stay quiet and observe people, and I can see right through the fake smiles and forced exclamations. All I can think is "Wow, these people need to go through all this to feel happy, meanwhile all I need is Netflix and a bed..."	It’s like a caffeine crash. I’ll be having fun, and then just suddenly get hit with a wave of emotional exhaustion.
If everyone agrees that Trump and Clinton are both terrible options, who is American Reddit actually voting for?	Trump. We have the same first name. Hey, no worse than the ppl voting for Clinton bc she's a woman!	I'm from Australia. You won't believe how much of OUR news headlines are dedicated to this fiasco in the USA. We have the popcorn on standby and are waiting in eager anticipation to see what happens. So, American Reddit: who are you actually going to vote for?
Do you wash new clothes before you wear them? Why or why not?	I usually do, especially if they're from a thrift store, because other people have touched them and I don't want their germs	I do, because one time years ago when I was getting a new pair of jeans I watched some guy have a sneeze fit. Then wipe his nose on the closest clothes rack to him, and blow it again. That moment will never leave me, and I'll wash everything.
Whats something you're good at, but hate doing?	Everything. Given a some basic training, I become very good at doing everything. The problem is... I hate doing everything. I want to do nothing. At all times. I hate doing things.	Fixing computers. There is nothing worse than fixing a friends machine only to have him wreck it again with porn two days later.
If you were given the option to download your consciousness into a digital format and "live forever", would you? Why or why not? What would you think you'd like to do in all that time?	If there was a reddit for consciousness, I'd be down voted from hard disk. Seems like that would be a fair system.	Yes I'd do it. As long as I get to have a choice of ceasing to exist whenever I wanted, and have the ability to delete that digital format. Because if my digital format were to fall into the wrong hands, then it would literally turn into hell for me.
What are some common tricks my brain plays on me, that I might not be aware of?	Yuor barin is wnoredufl at dceodnig wrods as lnog as the frsit and lsat ltrets are the smae. I bet taht yu hd no tourlbe rdaenig tihs at all.	Sex drive. Seriously I don't want to have to think about fucking everyone I see. Then when you fulfill it. You realize how much you didn't need it
What is the creepiest "glitch in the matrix" you've experienced?	I once got poor service at a restaurant and complained about it here on Reddit. Instead of everyone making up excuses for the waiter, I actually got upvoted! Creepy, Reddit siding with the customer . . .	Not me, but my dad was coming down the stairs at home and was calling for my dog, Katey. He hears a female voice reply "I'm over here." When he rounds the corner (the stairs have a turn in them) and faces the source of the voice, my dog is there looking expectantly at him. He was certain that it was me playing tricks on him, but he and the dog were the only ones home at the time. We still make fun of him for it but he was so shaken by it. There's been other weird happenings with the dog, so maybe she's just haunted or something.
Shippers of reddit, Does putting "fragile" on a box really make you treat it with more care? Or does that just make it more likely to "fall" off the trucks?	If your package can't survive being hurled across the room at a wall, it's not packed well enough. Words mean nothing.	They mean nothing. All packages in my work place arrive in a big cage all piled in together and then they are all dumped out and *thrown* into various smaller cages. It's up to the sender to secure the package.
Parents who found out your child was a bully, how did you deal with the situation?	Not a parent, but i was a bully as a child, but this stemmed from being bullied, so i used it as a way to cope. I think the biggest question is why and what can be done?	The biggest bully that went after me at school, with all the names, pushing, pranks etc His mother WORKED for the school So I told her "Your son is a real ass.." Her reply "Yeh I know.." With a disappointed face
What did "that one teacher" at your school get fired for?	One Day, We were perusing a novel in seventh grade that contained "nigger". An understudy in my class said he was annoyed by it and said he declined to peruse/complete the assignments since "him and his kin had been subjected to subjugation and prejudice, and still are today" before the entire class. The instructor reacted by saying "the nearest you've been to being a slave is choosing cotton from a container of Tylenol"	My art teacher got busted with a nude painting he had done of a girl in my class. She was 18 but he still got fired.
What’s the worst thing a therapist/counselor has ever told you?	Not a therapist/counselor but i once told my mum i wanted to start writing a book and she laughed at me and asked if i was actually serious	"I am not able to continue seeing you anymore because your mother thinks I am helping you too much." &#x200B; She was my favorite therapist too and still to this day am upset at my dysfunctional mother for making me stop seeing her..
Did you get laid in high school? Why or why not?	Yes I had a boyfriend who I was in love with and he was the best first lover a girl could ever have asked for. He set the bar.	No. Freshman year, just before Valentine's Day, the school newspaper asked me, "What's the best Valentine's Day gift you ever received?" I had never had a girlfriend so my answer, "A teddy bear from my mom." So that was printed in the school paper under a picture of me with my name.
Dear reddit. Why do you all fall for shit like this?	ITT: Hey reddit, why do you not see the world like I do and think like I do in every way? Shocker: Reddit is made up of a lot of people, not all of which are identical to each other. Or you.	He also said that the neither the girl or her parents pressed charges. That's the part that seems to make no sense at all.
Guys, what isn't nearly as hot/attractive as many girls think?	Almost daily, there is some poorly disguised misogynistic question that's used as an excuse to cry and bitch about women. I haven't been on Reddit long, but it seems to mostly be made up of whiny little boys who are afraid of women. Get it together, guys, and stop being so bitter. This shit is not attractive.	Playing hard to get all the time, especially when they establish that they like you. Once we get that out in the air, it shouldn't always be a fight for your attention or affection.
Adults of Reddit, what are your best LPTs for us teenagers?	Put the fucking phone down. Just turn the damn thing off for 2 hours a day. Read a book, learn a musical instrument, play board games with your family.	If you have a toxic friend, cut them out. Talk to them first and give them a chance, but don't feel any special obligation towards them.
Reddit, what's some good advice for someone starting college well past their prime (over 40)?	I did it late 30's and loved it. Advice? Sit at the front of the class and ignore the people who give you shit for asking questions when they just want the lecture to end, pay no mind to the ones who think you are some kind of suck up teachers pets. They are the ones that will be coming to you close to exams for lecture notes and help with essays.	I'm a professor and I've had 60+ year old students in my class before. You aren't past your prime, not even close. Older students are a joy as they are only there because they want to be, not because daddy is paying the tab. Work your ass off, get good grades, the rest will come as long as you working toward a degree that has value. Good luck.
What are the benefits to having children?	ITT: People pretend that children are required in order to give their lives purpose so that they can feel better about how unsuccessful they are. Half the answers to threads like these are cancer lol. Real reasons to have children would be: 1. you want to and are able to financially support one. If you don't want children, nothing they can ever give you will benefit you more than what they would take away.	An excuse for everything. Late? Sorry kid was sleeping. Want to leave a family function? Sorry but it's juniors bed time. It's seriously the best part.
People who married their first partner, how were you sure there weren’t “better options” out there?	Marriage is supposed to be about love. Love is about not caring about so called "better options" because you know the life you built with this person isn't worth fucking up.	Comparison is the thief of joy. All that matters is you choose to love someone for all their good & bad, and if you're lucky enough, to have that reciprocated.
Ex-burglars of Reddit, what things make people a target? What things deter burglars?	Had old high school friends that used to rob houses and cars and such. They've all repeatedly told me they would have really regret breaking into a house like mine back in the day. No alarm system, no cameras, no dog - just a whole lot of firearms and a lot of ammo, all within grabbing distance of my bed where I sleep. Edit: Should add I'm constantly leaving the house carrying firearm-sized bags, whether it be for hunting trips or target practice trips. I'm sure a would-be burglar would see this if he was sizing up the place.	A recent study showed that burglars come back to the same houses quite often. They do this because of a number of motives. 1: They want to take tings they, for some reason, couldn't take the first time. 2: They're kinda familiar with the house. 3: It's guaranteed that the people they robbed replaced the stuff they stole the first time, often these replacements are of better quality than the original. So after you get raided take good security measures.
What is something about computers that everyone should know how to do but doesn't know?	As someone who knows very little about computers, it drives me insane when IT guys think everyone should know the basics. Maybe we should, but that applies to other facets of life as well. The IT guy at my work is a fat slob. Do I make him feel like a moron because he honestly doesnt think eating 100g of carbs after 8PM is a bad idea? No. In my experience, computer savvy people tend to be the most arrogant, elitest people in the world. Get over yourselves.	They're not made out of fucking enchanted wizard metal. Just read what's on the screen and react rationally. 95% of the problems I encounter at work could be solved if people paid attention.
It may sound insignificant, but I just paid off my credit card, my car and my student loan and now don't owe any bank a single dollar. What are your achievements you'd like to share?	Two of my exes committed suicide. It makes me feel really good, as if they there's no point in living unless I am a part of your life.	I finally kissed a girl, granted I sucked at it, but still, for a guy who had no friends till a month ago it's a huge step.
Maids and cleaners of reddit, what's the weirdest thing you've walked into?	I have been waiting for this post for years. I was a cleaner at Scotia Plaza downtown Toronto. So many bankers would have ridiculous amounts of gay sex while doing drugs in the stalls. One day I had to break up a gay black and white couple with AIDS from pounding. This black guy pounded that white boy so hard in the end that he left the guy passed out over the stall. My 17 year old self walked into a skinny diseased man passed out over the bowl with his gapping asshole in the air.	Fuck I remember there was a montage of some guy getting hotel maids to walk in on him jerking it on a quest to find one that'll finish him. Spoiler: (he ends up with a guy finishing him). Anyone have it cause I can't find it for the life of me.
Reddit, I just slept for 13 hours. Why does my body so badly want to continue sleeping even after getting more than 8?	Reddit is not the place to ask medical advice. You will receive much better advice and assistance from your doctor. I strongly recommend you ask your doctor for a diagnosis.	After that much sleep your body is dehydrated and in fasting mode, hence being really tired and wanting more sleep. Once you get some breakfast/brunch/linner/nommage of some sort your metabolism kicks in and you start to wake up. This is the layman's response, /r/askscience will be more specific.
Reddit, what's your party trick?	I can listen to a song on YouTubes or the radio and then replay it on piano pretty accurately. Perfect pitch ftw.	My best party trick involves ignoring all the people while I eat food and pet whatever animals the host owns.
What's the worst example you've seen of someone ruining their life by posting on the internet?	>A petition has been created to have him arrested and kicked out of uni. And this is why I laugh when people think Europe has freedom of speech.	That Lifelock guy posting his social all over his website. He is now being accused of fraud and had his identity stolen 13 times.
Gay people of Reddit, what was your "Oh shit I'm gay" moment?	Once I was fucking my homie and during it my dog pulled my socks off, and after i finished i forgot to say no homo, also i accidentally accepted an invitation to be an r/dankmemes moderator and accidentally downloaded fortnite	It's kind of in three parts but the "oh shit" moment is obviously part three 11 years old - had a neighbor girl in her 20s that I """"admired"""" a lot for no good reason 14 years old - one of my friends was a bi girl and I really liked hanging out with her and one night I had a sex dream about her out of the blue. Also in hindsight I was never attracted to guys, I only liked getting attentions from guys for my ego 15 years old - Met a girl and crushed hard af and finally realized I liked girls. I thought I might be bi but I realized I never was attracted to guys later that same year.
What's the laziest thing you've ever done?	I won the lazy olympics, but they had to mail me the gold medal because I wouldn't go pick it up	I set up the fingerprint scanner on my work computer so I don't have to put my breakfast sandwich down to log in.
What pieces of advice are you sick of hearing from people?	"Smoking is bad for you" Thanks, stranger. I too am a human living on Earth. My stress and my dealing with it in my own way is none of your business.	Anyone with eczema can relate to this. Its as if every time I tell someone that I deal with eczema, they either have the cure or have a relative who does. I cant tell you how many times I hear people say, "Have you tried lotion?" Yes is the answer to that question. Edit: Stop trying to give me advice you damn trolls, Ive gotten mine to go away.
What is something you're surprised hasn't been invented yet?	Something that disables phone use for people sitting in the driver’s seat...like not as an option but as a mandatory feature	To quote the immortal Duckman, "How is it they can send a man to the moon, but not make a deodorant that lasts all day?"
What was the worse flight experience you ever had?	I've had a few bad experiences. It has to be a tie between 1. sitting in between an obese couple, with one of them pulling out a chicken wing with some smelly sauce?/sausage, idc what it was but it wrecked the atmosphere of the plane to the point that some girl a few seats over started puking. 2. \~8 hour plane ride with my family. the really hot flight attendants were up in front and i was in the back row with some lady in her 40s i believe with an ass SO STALE it gave me a headache. she also wasn't that nice	Half of my flight was filled with Chinese tourists that didn’t know that it was assigned seating, all were loud and taking pictures of every inch of the plane, and would often yell to each other in the middle of the flight in Chinese (it was an overnight flight).
What is the thing you wish your parents had exposed you to as a kid, but didn't?	I wish my mom didn't keep me so sheltered from relationships and sex and stuff like that. I didn't know what sex completely was until the 4th grade, most kids I knew had known what sex was since 2nd grade. So that led to me being completely being and not knowing what to do in a situation when the time called for it.	We weren't allowed to watch relatively "normal" shows as kids, like The Simpsons, Buffy, etc. It always felt like I was missing out, especially when other kids at school talked about shows I had never seen and I couldn't relate to, and I definitely was not going to tell them that I wasn't allowed to watch.
What thing does the English language not have a word for?	women don't pee out of is a completely theoretical question. the ring has no thickness or width. it is so great.	Having a vague sense that what you're about to do is stupid, but being unable to figure out exactly why.
In 22 years, Disney's classic films' copyright will start expiring, starting with Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. How is this going to affect them?	Isn't it reasonable that if a corporation is considered a person that their copyright should extend indefinitely so long as the company is 'living'? It seems unreasonable that Disney's back catalog would become freely accessible, year by year, starting in a couple of decades. What's more important is that copyright be amended so that two people can freely share their digital copy of Snow White without breaking any laws, as they would have with their VHS copy or any book etc.	The beneficiaries of the long lasting copyright will use their vast monies to petition congress to extend it further, like they have done in the past.
Guys, why are you single?	Because modern western society has given men no reason to pair bond, socially nor financially. Thanks to plastic surgery and makeup women stay more attractive for longer, and thanks to third wave feminism, they're more likely to fuck like pornstars on the first date and receptive to a casual sexual partnership. As for long term, no man wants to pay for a kid he didn't want, nor lose half of his money, nor be subject to a no fault divorce.	I don't try. That might just be me in denial, but I legitimately don't try. I make no efforts to not be single.
Reddit, in what ways are you a hypocrite?	I berate people for driving drunk because they might hurt themselves. I don't care what happens if I drive drunk.	Anything involving driving basically. If I do something stupid or dickish, it's justified because of [insert flimsy rationalization here]. Another driver does something stupid, he's just an idiot cunt asshole dumbshit incompetent fucktard.
Reddit Smokers, why did you start?	I started because I wanted to know what was it about. Only smoked a couple of years and though I started smoking alone, soon it was mostly socially. It was very stupid.	I realized it was a great way to make friends. See someone attractive? "Can I bum a smoke/do you have a lighter?" At a party - bored? Take a smoke break. Want to meet new people? Go outside to where they all hang out. Want to procrastinate? Go outside for "just one cigarette." At my school, the designated cigarette spots always had at least a few people there, who eventually became my friends, so it was always a social chilling spot. And once these people BECOME your friends, well.. you're all doing it, it's hard to get away.
What is that one moment from your childhood that your family never fails to remind you of?	When I was three, I stood on the kitchen table. Apparently, no three year old in the history of the universe ever stood on the kitchen table. I was given some awful nickname from my sister about it and she finally stopped calling me that when I was 20 and I punched her in the face.	My sister got a bike for her birthday but the tires desperately needed to be pumped up. My dad convinced me that I could do it with my breath, but when I tried blowing into the tire nothing happened. He then convinced me that I could blow harder if I flapped my arms like a chicken. This went on for about 15 minutes.
People who traveled the world. What did you choose not to say about a country you visited to keep the story positive?	Israel...you get to see street-hawkers sell AKs and other guns China...when we went shopping, all items were made in China lol. India is such a shithole...people living on the streets, shitting/pissing in public is ok but no kissing in public. And scamsters everywhere.	The train stations in Rome are filled with teenage pickpockets. Two different groups made attempts at us in 5 minutes. It was actually fun to watch once we realized their strategy.
What was the weirdest thing you have seen at someone's house that they thought was completely normal?	Went to an Asian friends' house went to the bathroom, and there's wet laundry hangging all over the towel racks and the shower curtains. And they're no ordinary laundry, they're all panties... Grandma undies...	A urinal in their living room. The guy's wife had died, so it was just him and his son. Pretty convenient I guess, but really weird. They tried to sell their house, but it wouldn't sell until they converted the urinal into a drinking fountain. I wonder why?
What's a TL;DR version of something you can bitch about for hours?	TL;DR There is no such thing as next gen. New consoles blow ass Performance wise. PCs have been, are, and will be always superior.	TL;DR: One terrible coworker will have a negative effect on great employees that will cause a negative effect on your company as a whole.
Psychiatrists/psychologists of Reddit, have you ever treated anyone with sociopathy on the higher scale? What was your most interesting/unnerving experience or case?	If I'm being truthful I've been accused of being a sociopath more than once. I know in high school my psychology teacher was terrified of me. Probably didn't help I'm 6'3 and was being scouted for football at the time. I used to be a bouncer and broke a guys ankle and told him it was his own fault for throwing the punch. Eh, whatever. I just have limited emotion, not a complete lack of them. I like to think of myself as the stoic	You can't really "treat" sociopathy, only make a sociopath realise that their actions can have negative consequences for them and hope they will behave. Source: my mate who's a psychologist.
What lesson did you learn the hard way?	That women will always eventually go for the douche bags and I should never even try to make romantic acquantince.	Actually put effort into choosing your college major. "I like chemistry and math" does not mean you will enjoy chemical engineering.
Men of Reddit, what movies have nearly brought you to tears?	I'm pretty immune to tearing up in movies. Most "sad" scenes don't seem to upset me. The closest I think I've ever been was actually in "The Hunger Games" where Prim is screaming and crying when Katniss volunteers. There's something about screaming children which stirs my emotions. I didn't even find "Up" or "The Lion King" sad.	I'm a father and The Road made me cry my fucking eyes out. There's no shame in crying by the way.
What would be gross as a liquid?	##Ahem. The Association of People with Unfortunate Last Names (APULN) would like to remind you that the word "Gross" should not be used in a negative light. Below is a helpful list of synonyms that are acceptable to use in it's place. * Vile * Disgusting * Putrid * Vulgar * Unpalatable * Stomach Turning Thank you for your continued cooperation in this matter.	Money. You'd still have to use it and it would just get everywhere. Change in your pocket would just be a squishy mess.
At 27, I've realized recently that I cut people off in conversations and rarely reciprocate polite questions in small talk. Reddit, what's your major "Holy shit, I'm an asshole!" moment?	You are not an asshole, you are either a New Yorker or some other type of person who has a life and is busy.	If I go to a party, and there is shrimp cocktail, I will stand over it and eat it all until its gone, like a vacuum cleaner.
What song do you hate by your favorite artist?	Not my favorite artist but Run to the Hills by Iron Maiden. Fucking hate that song. Also peace sells by megadeth	Any song which is once my favourite song at the time but I decide to set as my alarm. So many songs I now despise.
What company has forever lost your business?	Abercrombie & Fitch, after the CEO formally admitted in an interview that they do not advertise to plus size customers because they don't want plus size people wearing their clothes. Not that I would fit in anything there, but none of my children nor nieces nor nephews will be shopping there.	Chili's. They stayed open with no hot water and dishwasher broken. I ended up in the hospital with a 104 fever and was in for 4 days and out of work for a month because of Salmonella. A bunch of people got sick. A woman miscarried. Over 10 years later and I'll never step foot in one. Edit: I was out of work for a month because I worked in a kennel and you can pass it on to dogs. I had to have 2 negative test results then another week of waiting before they would let me back.
What "Fee" is without a doubt a 100% money grab/extortion that companies are charging?	the pharmaceutical industry is really greedy and corrupt. They have so much power over people's health and they can raise the price of any medication almost instantly with barely any oversight	I'm charged a fee every time I put money in my kid's school lunch account. It wouldn't be a big deal if I can put in the total amount she's going to need for the year but they limit the max you can contribute to like $150 at a time so I have to do this a few times a school year if she didn't bring her lunch half the time.
Reddit, what became of your school's bully?	They all are either pregnant and working dead end jobs. Or are just working dead end jobs and living at home. I'm excited for the 10 year reunion so I can show them how being popular in high school really meant nothing in the long run...after I show them pictures of my nice house and large paychecks. I love karma	He's currently in jail for trying to rob our local bank ... In his work uniform ... With his name tag on.
[Serious]Redditors who believed (or had people close to them who believed) the world was going to end on whatever date, what lead you to believe that and how do you feel about it looking back?	2012, didn't believe absolutely, more like cautions preparation. Replaced an old vehicle with a new SUV, stocked up on water and canned goods, and took that Friday off (for last minute Christmas prep I think is the excuse I used). On the 22nd, I donated a bunch of the canned stuff for the local Christmas drive, didn't have to buy bottled water for awhile, still loving the SUV. Thought I remember afterward wondering if we would look back and wish something major had happened. Considering everything that's happened since... kinda wish there had been a population thinning event.	I was 15 during Y2K, and my family and I all agreed that it was a giant joke. We planned to go to a cabin in the woods for New Years, because that's what we did for "every" New Years...it was just our tradition. But as we got in the car to head for the cabin, my 10-year-old stepbrother just breaks down in tears. Woah, dude...what's wrong? Turns out his dad had become a "survivalist" who told him the world was going to end on Y2K, and they would never see each other again. As none of us had really spoken to his dad in years, we had no idea of the insane bullshit he was filling my step-brother's head with.
What's your favorite paradox?	How many points IN SPACE are there between you and the nearest door? Now walk to said door. You have just traveled an infinite amount of points In mere seconds.	This might sound really silly but... In the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Link travels to future and initially learns the song of storms from a guy who claims "a kid a few years ago taught me it" and I guess subsequently went crazy afterwards. Later in the game, when Link travels back to the present he teaches the same man the song, thus fulfilling the paradox. Not really sure if that counts, but I like OoT wayyy too much.
What thing do you really like, but can't admit because you don't want to be associated with it?	Trump. Let me clarify by saying I'm not American, I don't like him as a man or even as a president. Americans almost want him to fail at this point now though and watching is akin to a train wreck.	I like learning about serial killers and famous murders, but I don't want to be identified as having a morbid fascination.
What things do people do on social media that pisses you off the most?	Stuff like "\#MeToo" for sexual assault or ";" for depression/suicide. Its all for attention and "good boy/girl points" if you actually cared about that stuff you would actively help with the issues. Not post 2 words (or less) on FB after you saw all your friends do it.	Parents who post detailed updates of their children's potty traning. "*Child* went poopy on the potty today! Definitely an improvement from yesterday when he pooped on the floor and painted the walls with it!" Complete with pictures.
What's the most outdated thing you still use today?	The calling function on my phone. I do still enjoy talking to people with my voice and not having to wait minutes or hours for a response. Super retro I know..	I work for long term health care company. Our computers have the third version of WordPerfect and the second version of Lotus 123. You can't even use a mouse with it, you have to use the function keys. We got the system company wide in 1994. So it was basically outdated when we got it. We have been using the same UNIX system for our company program since 1994 also. I have stuff saved in WordPerfect and Lotus since we got the system. It is so much fun to go back and look at the work I did 20 years ago. So much has changed! Just not our computers!
What misconceptions do people commonly hold about your line of work?	I am a chiropractor, everyone thinks I am a quack. But I don't do urban vodoo, or crazy crap at all and despise those that do.	I'm an advertising account executive and I do athletic training nights and weekends. Advertising: It's not like Mad Men where we start drinking at 10am. We wait until at least noon. Athletic training: It's not about us being hardasses and trying to pound you into the ground. More recently, my work has focused around getting people to slow down and do a bit less in order to achieve more. You're still gonna give it your all when you squat and deadlift and do Prowler sprints, but recovering from that work and ultimately being able to give it your all at game time is what's important, not you acting hard when you train hard 12 hours straight. Good job, you just made yourself useless for the next week, moron.
What cultural shift happened without people noticing?	Anitfacism (ANTIFA) is notoriously facist and the media says almost nothing against them and when they do, it's almost sympathetic.	Freely giving up your personal information. Email, name, occupation, and fingerprints for starters. These giant corporations like Facebook, Google, and Apple have it all and we willingly give it to them for the most part.
Taxi drivers of reddit, what was most WTF conversations you overheard from people in your back seat?	Alright, this is a funny story I can’t stop laughing about. I’m 27 and this happened about a year ago. I picked up a couple asking to go to an address in New Jersey. I was in New York and got paid almost nothing, mission accomplished.	Not a taxi driver, but I was in an uber pool with my gf going to the airport at 4am. We pick up this white girl, who looks high/drunk AF, and sits in the front seat next to our African driver. She starts talking and her words are slurring and asks the driver where he's from, to which he says "Kenya". She says "Hakuna Matata, I speak Swahili" and our Uber driver laughs at her. She says something else in Swahili and her and the driver talk for like 20 minutes in Swahili. The whole time my gf are just looking at each other like wtf is happening. Apparently she wasn't lieing and spoke some pretty good Swahili
Why do resistors sometimes delete their own comments that get thousands of upvotes?	Sometimes it's because it's a post I made that is potentially controversial if someone I know found my Reddit account. I believe in universal tolerance and accepting eachother, but I have pretty strong views that religion can be really harmful too.	Oh my what a question. I think it depends watt the context is. For current affairs the comment section can get really heated as everyone gets amped up (even the op) about their views. Tempers get short. Any potential difference of opinion becomes grounds for attacking someone. A quick circuit of the replies to top comments will turn up some really shocking insults and abuse. So I think people delete their comments to insulate themselves from that kind of negativity showing up in their inbox. Edit: I hope this thread doesn't become similarly emotionally charged and people can conduct themselves appropriately. Mandatory Edit: Thanks for the induction into the guild of the gilded. Hopefully it will get this comment some more attention and I can make some decent contacts with this gold!
Reddit, the University of Pittsburgh has received over 35 bomb threats in recent weeks, any wisdom from the hive mind?	Keep calm and carry on. Right now paranoia will kick in as people will either dismiss it as a series of pranks or as if its building up to something to cause the security to let their guard down. Damn you Americans can be crazy.	Any fellow Pitt students who might not know - we've been discussing the situation over at /r/pitt as each threat comes in. People with off campus housing have been offering spaces on couches and such for if your dorm gets evacuated. Right now we're trying to organize a reddit meetup as a way to blow off some steam.
What have you witnessed a bride or groom do at a Bachelor/bachelorette party that you thought would ruin their marriage if their spouse found out?	former stripper... been blown by several brides to be....not bragging....just telling the truth you would think that ruins a marriage but fact is marriage is a broken institute to begin with so it really doesn't matter you can't argue with i think is a 50 percent divorce rate /shutsoffmailbox	When I was in 11th grade my physics teacher randomly broke down in tears, telling us about how his fiance ODd at her bachelorette. Turns out it was supposed to be their anniversary. We watched a movie that day.
What "normal" thing is actually detrimental to society?	Shaming pedophiles for having attraction to kids. BEFORE YOU JUDGE, think about it. A person cannot control what they are attracted to, and making it into this huge shameful taboo only causes suppression, pain, and the increased likelihood of people victimizing kids. This should be an issue that is taught and discussed openly since a percentage of people will probably always have these inclinations. Remember that it's not the inclination that causes harm but acting on it, and acting on it probably often results from desperation and fighting oneself and shame.	People having to go to work when they are sick. It causes a chain reaction of more people getting sick.
People who got fired on the first day of the job, what happened?	I fell asleep like 3 times during their 8 hour boring as fuck training/safety videos. To be fair I know how to use a ladder. I know how to use a hammer. I know how to drive a van. I know how to use a screwdriver. Literally the most boring and useless videos I've ever seen.	They called me and told me I was let go for not showing up on my first day. Which was a surprise for me since at no point after the interview had I been told that I'd been hired.
People who left a MLM what finally made you leave?	TL:DR. If you are involved in anything MLM. You are a fucking gullible moron and deserve to be taken advantage of	I stopped to wawa every morning for a cup of coffee, while on my way to business meetings to sell "organic Instant coffee."
Sometimes, when I'm a passenger in a car going down the motorway, I have a strong urge to open the door. Do you have any strange impulses you have to stop yourself from carrying out?	This sort of thing is referred to, in translation, as "the appeal of the void." Same thing with the urge to jump from high places. Has nothing to do with wanting to die or cause yourself harm and is fairly common and normal. Locking the door isn't a bad idea, though. Unless you have the kind of car where pulling the inside handle unlocks it...	Ever sat in an emergency exit row on a plane? 32,000 feet above the middle of the pacific ocean. "Go ahead. Open it." Not now brain. "No, it'll be amazing, just do it." Stop it brain. "Cmooooon"
People of reddit, do you notice when a guy has a boner?	Not my main account because of reasons: I have a very big penis, I never thought much of it until I had a girlfriend... she made me really concious about it and tells me that everyone can see it and think that I have a perma boner. It makes sense because my flacid penis is bigger than your average erect one. So now a days I use baggy pants or pants a size bigger.	No but I bet I won't be able to stop myself from being creepy and staring at strangers crotches all day now
What is the worst advice given to you by a doctor?	He said that Ooo eee,ooo ah ah ting tang Walla walla, bing bang Ooo eee ooo ah ah ting tang Walla walla bing bang... Ooo eee ,ooo ah ah ting tang Walla walla ,bing bang Ooo eee ooo ah ah ting tang Walla walla bing bang	"The pain you are feeling in your right foot is normal, no more light duty for you" - US Navy doctor. My achilles ruptured the next week during a PT run (was in the Marine Corps). Thank you sir!
Is it okay for adults to sleep with stuffed animals? If there should be a cut off age, what age should it be?	I find this a little strange. I can understand why, it just makes me wonder why you’d need the security or reassurance. Then again, I do have a night light.	I'm 38. You can pry my stuffed dragon from my cold, dead hands. Until then, it stays in my bed.
What is the most amount of pain you've ever felt at one time?	I have POS so I can go for five months with no period so when it comes is like my bodyweight of blood coming out of me plus awful pain. Last time I cried so much I fell from the bed and had to call my mom at work to help me.	Eleven. the pain went to eleven. it was a Kidney stone. Ive had an axe stuck halfway through my arm, and that pain was only a 5.
People of Reddit, what's a simple decision that completely changed the course of your life?	Not trying to be funny or purposely provocative, but I know someone who cannot answer this question anymore due to his 'simple' decision.	Dusting the top of my cupboard, in the early 1990s. While doing so, a magazine fell from the top of the cupboard, where I'd randomly thrown it a couple of years earlier. I picked it up, and browsed through it. One of the articles was about visiting the newly free ex-socialist countries in Central and Eastern Europe. I liked the article, and the description of the people and the countries really made me want to experience life there for myself, so I wrote to the embassies, and inquired about teaching languages. I ended up being selected, and have stayed in the region ever since. I've given up teaching though.
How did you know you had to break up with your SO?	When I introduced her to my family. They were livid and did not want to accept her. All because she was imaginary.	We'd been "together" for a year and she still freaked out whenever I mentioned the future. Also, correcting her parents every time they called me her "boyfriend".
What is something you wish your parents taught you from a young age?	How to maintain a good credit score. How to budget. How to apply for a loan. How to set up a primary healthcare provider.	How to say "no." As a kid, saying "no" to our parents will earn us punishment. It took me until I was in my low 20s to learn how to refuse or walk away from situations that I didn't like or that made me uncomfortable.
Reddit, if kids don't know what a VCR is anymore, are there other common household things that have long been forgotten? That if we saw today, we would have no idea what it was used for?	I'm so sick of this... I'm 19 and I used Apple IIs and floppies to do homework when I was a kid. My 8 year old sister regularly uses our VCR to watch the literally dozens of tapes we have. Kids aren't stupid. Do you think people born in the 70s have no clue what a phonograph is?	We're talking things our parents used before we were too young to remember, right? a tamper (a thin metal post in the center of the table for tamping down your cigarette) the graylor (a grate the you flip down from the sink, think like a footrest, so you can give your baby a bath in the sink) an air-schlade (a loom-like device that you use to quickly dry towels outside, like a mangler for rich people, you can see that girl from Mad Men using a foot-powered one in the second episode, I think) oh, and a mangler - hand-powered spin cycle.
What was your "Oh shit, my friend's an asshole" moment?	She didn't talk to me for weeks, and when she finally opened up all she said was "ppppbbhhhttttt" and released this horrible smell. I tried asking her what was wrong, but she started shitting all over me.	Told her a personal story, asked and trusted her to keep it to herself. A few weeks later: "So a friend told me this fucked up thing...." And tells me that exact story. First instance in a short chain of events that ended that friendship.
What's the most outrageous price to an item you've ever encountered?	Someone has conveniently made a page of the most outrageously priced items on the internet for this very purpose. www.apple.com Enjoy!	It was a Bank Charge. So it's kind of not an item, but we made a donation to an overseas company, the bank took $99 million dollars out of our account instead of the $740 they were supposed to, which was a mistake, but then they wanted to charge us $413,000 in interest for our account being overdrawn for one day. I actually got a call from the bank manager saying we needed to pay the money. I kindly (not) explained to him to go re-check his paperwork and to never call me again.
What's the one thing you hate about your country?	The rapid rise of a far-right, racist political party. Just like in the US, it’s suddenly completely acceptable to be proud to be a racist asshole. It’s pushing other parties to the right, too.	That it takes so fucking long to get anywhere. Driving 12 hours east will get me to the boarder of Quebec and 24 hours west I'd still be in Ontario.
Reddit, how do you study?	I do my homework like I do my girlfriend, slam it on a table and do it all night long.	Cramming is the worst thing you can do. I have a final coming up on tuesday, and it involves having to memorize a 60 page work book, in full, for an 11 page final. So I started about a week ago. Its 11 chapters, so I study a chapter a day; about 5 pages. Every few hours I pick it up and read through it, 10 minutes at a time max. By the end of the day Ive looked at it about 5 times, then the next day I repeat with a new chapter+the previous. Slow and steady wins the race y'all.
What is something insignificant to everyone else, but gives you the feeling of "nails on a chalkboard"?	When people cook a chili or stew and leave the stirring spoon just sitting there with a layer of the food on it between stirs.	I get irrationally angry when I see one of those Nissan Cube cars with its stupid asymmetrical back window. What a stupid looking car. Fuck you, Nissan Cube!
Non-Americans of reddit, what is the "Bigfoot" or "Area 51" equivalent of your country?	FYI to the non-Americans: "Bigfoot" is a mythical creature which some say exist. He's like a giant man/ape thing that lived in the woods. "Area 51" is a classified government site in the desert that the rumor says is where the government conducts research on a crashed alien spaceship, or maybe actual aliens. I always hate the "what's the [obscure reference] of other things?" questions so I wanted to make it less obscure	In france we have a mythical creature in the mountain regions called a "dahut". What's funny is that it supposedly has shorter legs on one side, either left or right, to accomodate the slopes he lives on. So if you encounter one, you just have to shout, which causes him to turn around, thus falling down because the long legs are now on the top side of the slope... That flaw makes them a rare sight and an endangered species.
People who did poorly in school, did it really effect you later on in life?	Not at all. Grades don't really matter, specially the school ones. Right now I'm at the university (getting my second degree) and honestly I'm doing way better than what I did at school	I got a good example of a friend of mine. I did excel in school because it was just so easy. I lost motivation pretty fast and now I think of myself as about average. I never really had the drive to learn for someone else and so as classes got harder my grades got continually worse until I finished university with the minimum score needed. My friend however always struggled in school and worked his ass off. I got worse, he got better and in the end he finished university with honors while I had the minimum passing grade. I think if you do poorly you just have to apply yourself and work more but that brings the work ethic up and in the end work ethic is the most important factor in determining your success.
HELP: My brother was assaulted which resulted in a broken jaw, had it wired shut, and now that he needs the wires removed, the hospital is telling us his surgery needs to be paid in full before he may have it. What do we do?	If he was in the military, sorry to say you're SOL. My friend's husband was literally gutted (yes, as in had his stomach cut open by a long bladed knife) by an active duty seal on leave when he was working as a bartender. The situation was purged from civilian LE records and it was all handled by military courts and my friend and her husband weren't allowed to know the outcome or pursue any charges against the Seal.	I may be way off here, but if he's in the military he was likely turned over to the MPs and thus your paper trail problem. Pursue that angle and see where it gets you.
If you could ban anything, what would you ban? Why?	Cyclists who bike on the streets. I can’t even count how often I was stuck behind one of those dicks because he thought the street belonged to him and I had no chance to pass him.	Companies make you sign in, in order to unsubscribe from their emails. Edit: I tried Elite Singles. Didn't enjoy it. And THIS^^ is what I have to do to completely cleanse my life from it.
HR People of Reddit, I'm dying to know, do you actually read cover letters? If so, what was the worst one you've ever read?	I'm a Hiring Manager. I never read the cover letter. If your resume is longer than one page, big points are deducted. Give me your best one page. That's it.	I scan cover letters quickly to see if they actually add to my understanding of the candidate. If they are long, uninteresting and simply reiterate what's on the resume, I toss them aside. The best cover letter I ever read, in response to an ad for a copy editor: "I love to read. I love to write. I hate mistakes."
What's the videogame you've played the most and why?	I know I'll get hate but I've spent close to 600 hours in Destiny which would be the most in recent memory. I guess Tetris would trump that if you add together all iterations that I've played	Civilization 5. I'm not even a gamer but holy shit that thing is addictive. It starts off as "one more turn", which then develops into to "Oh I'll just capture this city quick" to "Well, it feels stupid to not destroy their capital now". 5 hours later and Alexander fucks me over in the World Congress and all that work is undone.
This happened while playing on a claw machine, is this why I never win a prize?	Yeah, there's usually a set ratio of wins to credits. For example, you may have 1 win every 10 credits. There's a trick to winning these games (although you may seem a bit creepy). First of all, stand back and watch other people play the game. Count how many credits it takes between players before someone wins (or almost wins). Do this again and you know approximately how many credits it takes before the machine gives a "real" chance at winning. Next, you need to wait for some players to more or less "use up" the "dummy" rounds until they give up. Step in, put in a few credits and win your prize. Obviously you've got to really want the toy to do this, as sometimes it can take a long time to gather the data you need.	Yes, I have a friend in the biz, warned me about this years ago. They can be set by the operator for how much of a pay out (how often the claw actually works).
What's the best analogy you've heard to explain something complicated?	Some of the analogies posted on here are absurdly long. If the analogous explanation is longer than the direct explanation, it's a poor analogy.	One day I told my boss I thought automating a tax calculation in Excel wasn't a good idea because people would eventually forget how to calculate it manually. Without missing a beat he replied "Well, I don't know how to crank-start my car either. Sometimes it's just time to simplify a process." Edit: Just a bit of clarification. This was a formula to automatically calculate gross rental tax on certain leases in FL and CA.
Reddit, what is the worst thing to accidentally touch?	A women's boob by accident in this day and age. "Ohh you accidentally got to close and barely brushed my Boob. SEXUAL HARASSMENT!"	That gympi tree or whatever it's called in Australia, that's so painful people have killed themselves rather than endure the pain
If a woman rapes a man and gets pregnant, what happens next?	Theoretically speaking she would get charged for rape and go to prison, probably a nice one where she is by herself so the inmates don't hurt the baby. I don't think the man would have any legal obligation to ever see or hear from that woman or the child again.	in MOST states: the man will pay child support. however, the man can bring suit against the woman in tort and recover a judgment against the woman. if the woman has assets, it could end up a wash (judgment payments canceling out child support payments). however, if the woman does not, or if the woman has the judgment debt wiped out through bankruptcy.... then the man is involuntarily fucked a second time. source: i am a lawyer.
Today I had to go to the Dept of Social Services to pick up my SNAP card (food stamps). I felt completely and totally embarrassed, ashamed, and incapable of providing a basic necessity for my family. What has made you feel completely worthless and how did you "get over it"?	Sometimes you just have to put your pride in your pocket and take the high road. Like you said you have to feed your family. As long as you are not buying shit like steaks, shrimp and like 6 cases of pop there is no shame. Dont be one of those people who abuse it. I wish I had the card when I was down and out 3 years ago. I made "too much" (on unemployment) so I didnt qualify for it. I dont have any kids though so it wasnt that big of a deal but it sure would of helped. Best of luck to you.	I had to get on stamps a while ago. It sucked and I felt terrible. How did I feel better? Because I knew it would feed my family and I wasn't treating it like a hand out but a leg up. It's a means to an end in a temporary situation. Another thing that helped me was knowing that I spent YEARS paying into this service, I earned the right to use it for a while.
Redditors who have worked with celebrities, what are they really like?	Tom hiddleston smokes a fat fat fatty and and is hung like a horse and fiarly normal, according to his costumer for The Avengers	I was a stand-in for a Nicolas Cage film. He mostly kept to himself and would walk around with a cigar being all Nic Cage-like. During one fight scene there was a small amount of fire involved and something went wrong. He got super angry and started yelling at everyone. It was awesome.
What is the thing you absolutely hate, but everyone else seems to like?	DLC. Game developers just won't stop nickle and diming us for low quality content but for some reason people keep eating it up. **EDIT**: Why the *fuck* am I being downvoted?	Clubbing. It sucks. You spend loads of money to be stuck in a dark room with sweaty strangers and music so loud you can talk to your friends. The drinks are over priced, the floor is sticky and all the music sounds the same.
People of Reddit who thought "screw this" and quit your job on the spot, how did you get to that point and how did it work out for you?	Really screwed up with one of my gun "sales." I was told to take care of a customer who I thought had done federal paperwork and walk him out because he already paid. However, his paperwork was never done and he walked out with the firearm. It was awful communication between employees on a busy Saturday but not a huge deal because he came back and fixed it. Anyway I got called into the office and my manager gave me a long reprimanding where he tried to intimidate me off the sales floor and his tone was totally bullshit. I already understood the severity but he was being a total asshole about everything. I said fuck this and left that day.	I was in university working at pizza hut. The assistant manager was an asshole that always was too touchy with the girls working there. I started dating one of those girls, he was still touchy, so we had a talk. After that, he hated me and tried to screw me over on scheduling a lot, so I always had to get the manager to fix the schedules. Skip forward like 6 months and I was the next person to get off, but he was keeping me for way longer than he should. I had friends who were going to see Spirited Away in a theatre about an hour and a half away (only chance I had to go, probably). I was just like "Can I go? No...okay, I quit. I'll find another minimum wage job tomorrow." Drop apron, leave... Not so exciting..
Successful people who got crappy grades in high school or college - what are you doing now and how did (or didn't) your grades affect your success/career?	I have a high I.Q. and school was boring for me. I had crappy grades and still got into college, did computer science related work but it blew bubbles. Got out of that and into working in the diesel industry also began producing music and very successful at both. I have never been asked about my grades in school. Just grind, you don't need a piece of paper to be successful, you just need the work ethic.	I got really bad grades in both. When I was in my early thirties, I had a big chip on my shoulder about it and started taking college classes at-large, one at a time. The motivation I had to do well in them was incredible. After a while of that, I was able to take my new transcripts and use them to get into grad school. No one cared that I had gotten poor grades ten years earlier.
What was the most satisfying bridge you've burned?	What was the most satisfying bridge you've burned and how did you burn it? Is there anything you regret not doing when you burned the bridge?	I had an Aunt who disowned her adopted daughter because she wanted to make sure she didn't inherit anything. I told her that my cousin was still my cousin and that if she was not her mother anymore that she must not be my Aunt. Never spoke to her again and it has been MARVELOUS.
Who/what is the best villain of all time and why?	The Joker, I don't know how he would be if it wasn't for Heath, but the acting just could not get better.	Magneto. A holocaust survivor who is so afraid of 'his people' being the victim of another such event that he is fighting to prevent it. The way he's fighting to prevent it is by modeling himself after the very group of people that caused him so much pain. I can't think of any series off the top of my mind, but when Marvel dives into his history and motivations, you want to, at the same time, be on his side and hope someone stops him.
People who've quit their jobs on short notice out of spite. What was the final nail in the coffin?	There was only one time. I want to say I was 19 or so, basically I was assigned to a job I just didn't want to do so I kinda walked to my car and left without saying anything. Generally I'll wait til the end of day on a friday then let my employer know its my last day working there, I'll thank them for the "experience" a quick handshake and thats it.	I had a boss ask me to change how I took my bipolar medication so I could trigger permanent mania as I got more done that way. Uhhh.. no.
Redditors who have experienced this: What actually happens when someone says " I object" at a wedding?	All of the comments in this thread are a lie. The "does anyone object" part of a wedding is drama stirred up by directors to make their rom-coms more dramatic.	I read a story on here once about someone's minister say "If anyone objects, now is not the time. You've had months leading up to this. But find me after the ceremony...I love gossip."
What celebrity do you have an irrational hatred for?	I'll be downvoted, but John Stewart. Politics aside, he has blatantly lied on his show, and at that point it's not satire. Colbert is funny though and so is John oliver, I liked his fifa segment	I dont know if he is a celebrity. But the kid who use to whisper "Zoom, Zoom" for in the Mazda commercials.
Gay/lesbian people of Reddit what is the most annoying thing people ask and or do around you?	“Bro can you er, like, suck me cos my gf is out of town” Like, it’s so annoying if you’ve just done your hair and then have to blow a hetro. And you can’t say no because it’s illegal under gay law to refuse a hetro bro load. Straights will never understand how hard it is to be gay :(	'So, who's the male/female in the relationship?' We're both females. That's the point. It's like asking a vegetarian 'so which part of your salad is the steak?'
What's the most inappropriate time that you started laughing and couldn't stop?	I was 16. And *fried* on acid. And my friend's sister started hitting on me. Now, this girl was roughly 5'5" and about 225 pounds, but hey, pussy is pussy, right? So we start getting into it, go to her room, her clothes come off... ...and I *lost* it. Completely. Dear gods, I laughed my ass off while that poor girl tried frantically to cover up. I finally choked out "Sorry, " and fucking ran. Never saw her or that friend again...	I'm an airline pilot and often when flying with a co-pilot you get on well with, you will try to make each other laugh while doing the PA to the passengers; mindless things like drawing cocks on paperwork, rolling up newspapers and hitting your colleague over the head with them or playing Top Gun quotes from your iphone. Generally I manage to choke out my PAs with a reasonably straight face (so to speak) but once I lost it so bad I snorted with laughter mid-sentence, had to cease the PA, then come back and just admit 'Sorry ladies and gentlemen, my colleague was distracting me'. Most unprofessional, yet hilarious.
What is the thing you want to see most in your own lifetime?	I want to be able to see Religion become a minority amongst people in my lifetime, however unlikely it may seem.	I really hope that I get to see Betelgeuse exploding as supernova. The chances are slim, but there's no crime in hoping. Just imagine: one night you look out the window, and see that the horizon is unusually bright. Then, Orion rises. But instead of a reddish star that was Betelgeuse, you see an object as bright as the Moon. In fact, it would be visible in broad daylight. For several months. An awesome display of nature's power.
How did you catch your Significant Other cheating on you?	This isn't a story but a question. I see a couple of you saying that you went through their phone. Why? This isn't an insult by any means but, it seems scummy in a way. I know they cheated but the fact that you went through their phone is just horrible. The cheating is much worse but still. **IT'S NOT AN INSULT, JUST MY OPINION AND I WANT YOUR OPINION!**	Got a ridiculously irate phone call one morning from some woman asking why I kept texting her boyfriend, and that I was ruining their family .... Her boyfriend was my husband.
People of reddit, what lie have you told a kid just to mess with them?	I don't lie, I straight up crush their dreams and fantasies by saying 'Santa Claus doesn't exist, and there is no tooth fairy because your parents put the money there'	I told them I was a robot, and "proved" it by doing math in my head. They were in second grade, I was in college, and about the hardest problem they could think up was "What's a thousand plus a thousand?" The robotics program over at the college is doing some very impressive things, I told them.
Redditors who used to be abusive, how did you realize what you were doing and how did you change?	I was abusive to myself whenever I played video games as a kid. I would bite the controller, bite the cables, push furniture into walls, jump in rage and smash the ground with my feet, or hurt myself through biting or pulling my hair. I was playing a game on the DS once and I lost. I raged out and smashed my thumb into the screen. My thumb bent backwards from the middle joint and made a popping noise. After that, I realized how stupid I was for getting angry enough to hurt myself that badly, and something in me clicked and now I don't rage as much. I mean, I'll shit talk the day away if I lose, but at least I don't punch walls anymore. Edit: why is this being downvoted?	My wife was trying to climb out of a 2nd story bathroom window to escape me. I was sitting in the hallway, watching and laughing at her. Out of nowhere, I 'saw' the fear in her eyes. It was precisely the way my mother used to look at my asshole stepfather. I realized I was becoming him. And that was the night I got sober. I'd never been abusive in any past relationships, after all. The only thing that had changed with that relationship was the introduction of alcohol. Common denominator, found. Checked myself into rehab the next morning, as soon as they opened the doors. Stayed for 9 months, while working and trying to repair the relationship.
What small seemingly insignificant thing have you lost that just crushed your world?	In pokemon, I lost my exp. share. When you lose that you basically just have to restart your game, because leveling by switching pokemon out just takes too long	I had a locket with a picture of my Mom holding me right after I was born. y Mom wasn't in my life for many years and that was the only picture I had of her. One day I'm playing with my Dad's SO's kids (who I hated) and her son rips my locket off my neck and throws it into a bayou by where I lived. I freaked out and he runs back to my house laughing. I searched and searched for that locket but I never found it in the muddy water. When I got back to my house I got in trouble for getting dirty and proceeded to freak the fuck out and tried to hurt the kid who threw my locket. More trouble. Bastards.
What false facts are thought as real ones because of film industry?	Women making less than men in the same job field. Feminist nonsense. Go get a STEM job and quit your bitchin.	Grenades are not firey explosions. There's a lot of force, but no fire. It looks more like a tiny, short dust storm.
What is something you grew up with that you didn't realize was regional?	I didnt realize that lots of the country doesn't have quick and easy access to really nice quality wine. It baffled me to find out how many people are content to drink wine from a box	Every Friday during the warm months my neighborhood would have a fish fry were everybody brought the various fish they had caught that week. If you didn't fish you were required to bring beer and brats instead. I realized not everybody did this when I was visiting family in New England and commented that nobody in our family had gone fishing to prepare for Friday.
I have face blindness. What issue do you have that people don't believe when told about?	Me - "I'm allergic to milk" Everyone - "Oh so you're lactose intolerant" Me - "Are you fucking kidding me?" Edit - Seem to be getting a group of replies that indicate that I have unrealistic expectations about people's knowledge. It's not that I expect them to know what it is, I just expect them not to tell me I have something different that they *have* heard of. They assume they know better and insert what their expectation is.	I heard about a person who had the opposite of face blindness- the person remembered every face she had ever seen. Even if it was just someone on the streets. So then, everyone looked familiar, so she couldn't tell if she was friends with them or not.
What did you do in middle school/junior high that makes you cringe even today?	I went for a date with a pornstar who was my classmate. My friend showed me her videos before it became serious.	I used to bring a Slinky to school and try to walk it like a dog everywhere. I can't for the life of me understand why I did that.
Redditors who had sex with someone from a completely different culture, what is your funniest/weirdest story?	Asian dude asked me if I felt it yet. The hip action was second to none. Didn't matter. Nope. Dropped him quick. I'll give just about anything a try, but the stereotype was true. 😕and he had no other skills to make up for it. Didn't even try. He was convinced that he was all that and a bag of chips. I mean damn son. Chicks I've been with were better and they've got nothing! Just sad all around.	I like to think I'm a good kisser (had a compliment here and there) and one time I was making out with this Chinese guy whose English I thought was pretty great but he breaks off in the middle of kissing and just says "you're so hearty -heartier than a peach!" and goes right back to making out again. Hey, I'll take it. Whatever the fuck he meant.
What's the dumbest music lyric you have heard?	Any song that rhymes two of the same words. For example: "He was a skater boy, she said 'see you later boy'." God dammit, "boy" doesn't rhyme with "boy"!	From 'Life', by Des'ree... "I don't want to see a ghost It's a sight that I fear most I'd rather have a piece of toast And watch the evening news..." Pretty sure this was voted the worst lyric in British chart history. Edit: Thank you for the reddit gold / It will not help me with my cold / Or stop me feeling so damn old / But thank you anyway.
Employers and managers who had to fire their best employee - what happened?	When i worked at a food processing plant, I was employee of the year 3 of the 6 years there. Then we got a new pickle slicer and I could not stop thinking about putting my penis in there. Went on for weeks until one day, I just finally did it. Put my penis in the pickle slicer. At break. Got caught. Got fired. They fired the girl slicing pickles too.	We hire a lot of people in recovery who are a part of the drug court program under the condition that they will be terminated if they go back to jail for drug/alcohol charges. This coworker was our hardest worker and always picked up shifts and got tons of compliments, so it really sucked when she relapsed and failed her pee test with drug court, she got sent to jail for a week and we had to fire her. I still kept in touch with her, and when I found out she was pregnant, I convinced my boss to hire her back. One last chance. I'm so happy I wasn't wrong because she's about to celebrate her 4th year of sobriety and she's now management.
I live in Asia, but my school is in Europe. I commute everyday between the two continents. It is very regular for the people living here. What is something relatively unique about the place you live in?	One of the most beautiful cities in the world, Istanbul. Nothing better than a ferry ride at sunset drinking apple tea.	I live in Rome, Italy, and see a 2000 year old pyramid from my bathroom. Also, I often drive around the Colosseum at 70 km/h just to get somewhere because I'm late.
What is a sneaking suspicion that you have about a famous person?	Obama is at most, agnostic. But very possibly an outright Atheist. The man is too smart and too practical to believe in any of the traditional religions associated with America.	That Adam Sandler is secretly in love with Drew Barrymore, and every few years stalkerly casts her in a movie opposite himself to try to make her realize how much she loves him too.
What is the most pointlessly irritating thing your neighbour has done?	They sit on the sidewalk in front of the apartment and smoke. I have to walk past them frequently and the smell is irritating. I don't understand why people still smoke after all these years of medical data.	Came home from middle school one day to find my neighbor and a few arborists cutting down our (probably) 100+ year old oak tree in our backyard. This guy let them believe it was his house and lemme tell you they were PISSED when they found out he lied to them. His reason? Some of the branches hung over his property line. In the end we sued him and made him pay to have an old oak uprooted and transported from a nearby site. So he ended up paying for the arborists fee and a tree relocation (which are both quite expensive). Total asshole.
What's your most embarrassing "putting two and two together" moment?	Found out that the saying "be there or be square" was because if you're late, you are not 'a round' ...	When I was a little kid, my mom would bet me that I couldn't eat my carrots without them making a "snap" noise. I was bound determined to prove her wrong, caaaaarefully biting in until *SNAP*... dammit, let's try again on the next one, careful, careful... *SNAP* DAMMIT I think I was about 16 before I realized she doesn't care in the slightest about the bet, she just wanted me to eat my damn veggies.
What is your "I can't wait to do that when I'm older! " but haven't yet done it?	Get a tattoo. I'm very glad I never got one when I was younger cause I'm sure whatever dumb shit I would have picked would be embarrassing today. I'm very indecisive and I get too worried that I'd be disappointed with whatever I got. Edit: downvotes for not having a tattoo? Ok then.	Play video games ALL DAY LONG. I can only play for a couple hours at the most before I start to feel useless and shitty.
which are the most darkest jokes you know?	Why do you put a baby with his feet first into the blender? ----------------- So you can cum on its face while it dies.	I was on the bus with my friend the other day when I told the joke: "What do you do if you see an epileptc having a seizure in the bath? Throw your laundry in with him!" Unfortunately, there was a man sitting behind us when I told this, and he leaned over the seat and said "That's not funny at all, my Son happened to die from having a seizure in the bath." We were both obviously mortified, and the man got up to leave as it got to his stop. As he passed us we heard him say "The fucking idiot choked on a sock."
Americans of reddit, what do you find weird about Europeans?	Nothing really. I find Americans to be the weird ones. Europeans were here first, they have been living their way for literally thousands of years. Easiest thing to do in Europe is spot an American.	When I lived in Italy years ago I thought it was interesting that every day at 12am some of the local channels would turn into a video of a girl touching herself with a bunch of phone numbers on the screen.
As you're drifting into sleep from anesthesia, what would be the worst thing to hear your surgeon say?	Trick question, because the surgeon is RARELY in the room as your drifting off to sleep. The CRNA still has to intubate you, add any additional lines, get you positioned with the rest of the staff, may need a foley from the RN, surgical site prepped and draped. The surgeon walks in about 30 seconds before all that is complete 😂	I had knee surgery when I was 17. I still remember the surgeon saying to his staff "It's the right knee, correct?" As I went under. The surgery was for my left knee. He had a dry sense of humor.
Ok Reddit, with all these "As Seen on TV" products being synonymous with poor quality, which of these products would you personally vouch for, and which were just absolute crap?	Glass. I see glass on my TV every damn day I look at it, and holy shit, that stuff is pretty damn glassy whenever I see it in real life. Seems like it might be of lower quality, but pretty close to what I see on my TV. I'd give it a 8.9/10.	My parents once procured a device known as a "titan peeler". In the ads, the fellow uses the peeler on such unpeelable objects as a squash and a pineapple. The peeler works as advertised. But also has an unquenchable thirst for blood. 5 out of 5 people who used it wound up bleeding due to nicking their fingers with it. The blade is beyond sharp, and due to size, the peeler is somewhat awkward, so catching your fingers is inevitable. The peeler has now been incarcerated for its violent crime spree, and parole is unlikely.
Pizza guys/girls, does your shop have a "No Delivery" list? What houses are on it and why?	not a delivery boy but my local pizza store banned me because i always paid in cents (euro) a pizza here at my place 7euro and for big ones are 11euro also i am poor,. this went flawlessly until they got a new delivery guy who got me banned due to my clumpsyness, as i was paying i accidentally kick the delivery guy and accidentally throw the money to the ground, i help the guy pick it up and told him i'm sorry but after that i was never able to order from them again. prolly they got tired of me paying in cents too.	Friend of mine told me about one place that got blacklisted when he worked for Dominos, it was an apartment building right at the edge of the delivery radius, and whenever they went, the elevator was out. Naturally, the person ordering was on a high floor (it was usually the same person), so he'd have to run up 10+ flights of stairs after driving pretty far, and they'd complain that it was late and/or cold, generally acted like assholes about it. There was a Dominos closer to them IIRC too, so he was pretty sure they did it deliberately for free shit. I don't think they blacklisted the building/person per-se, just closed the delivery distance by a tiny bit so that building was out of it.
Teachers and students of Reddit, what is the most ingenious method of cheating you have witnessed?	This is secondhand, but a friend had a student who signaled the answers to a multiple-choice exam by eating m&ms of various colors. The person was caught, presumably because he or she was holding up each m&m like an idiot before eating.	I knew an Arab girl who would write chem notes and formulas all around her hands and wrists in Arabic so it looked like henna designs. Never been so jealous in my life
What should this new "9th Planet" be named?	How about naming it after something from Star Trek or Star Wars? Here's some names I picked out: Bespin (for a small giant planet like Neptune) Vulcan (Spock's homeworld) Borg (Cyborgs from Star Trek) Kazon (Dangerous enemy from Voyager series) Ibleam (Parent planet of the Forest Moon of Endor) Or we could just name it Nibiru to eliminate all those doomsday conspiracies.	Lots of funny jokes here, but it should probably follow tradition and be named after a Roman god. As it's the last, I would suggest Janus, the God of endings, beginnings, and transitions. It represents the edge of our solar system, the beginning out outer space, and the transition between. It also represents our transitions into this new era of astronomy where such things can be found. Ed: Janus is actually already used as the name of on of the moons of Saturn. So either we rename that moon (unrealistic) or we use another one suggested below. I like Nyx personally, but there's a lot of great ideas below. Ed2: ok so Nyx is also a moon. So Nyx that idea.
What is the ballsiest way somebody you know quit their job?	Some guy at the fast food place I work in just randomly jumped on the microphone and started yelling at everyone. He said, "Fuck you! Fuck you! FUCK YOU! You're cool. Fuck you, I'm out!"	One of my cooks calmly walked to the ice machine in the middle of the shift. I didn't think to much of it, until he came back with a bucket of ice and dumped it in the fryers. The entire kitchen when dead silent for what seemed like forever, then all of the sudden the low boiling noise started. With in seconds the fryers are throwing boiling oil all over the place. About 30 seconds later they catch on fire and the fire suppression system goes off. It sprays a 6 inch layer of foam everywhere. The guy walked to the microphone in the kitchen and calmly says "fuck all of you, I'm out." We had to shut down for 2 days to clean up the mess and the cook was arrested and sued. It was epic, but couldn't have been worth it in the end.
What is something you're tired of hearing Reddit complain about?	Fucking gun rights. No other country has the gun problems America does but people keep burying their heads in the sand and saying that it's not a problem with gun regulation, it's a problem with mental health or whatever excuse they can come up with to keep their toys.	Everything. To me, the complaining has gotten worse over the years. I'll go to subreddits where I want to discuss a show or game I enjoy, and its just littered with complaints, mundane ones at that. Turns me off.
Americans of Reddit, what's something that America gets shit for that is actually completely reasonable in context?	Our gun culture. We're borne of armed insurrection. We're the children of castoffs and wanderers and I don't want the only gun in a tense situation to belong to the other guy.	Laws on Jaywalking. Coming from the UK, I never understood this, but having been to Seattle a few times - I totally get it. Most roads in cities (in Seattle at least) are at least three lanes wide, and each lane about twice the width of a UK one. At the end of every block there always seems to be a crossing. Would be madness to chance it.
If you could put a non lethal, non painful curse on someone to annoy them forever, what would it be?	Slow internet connection. Nothing too slow, around 50-100kb/s. You have a 1.500€ PC, bought Far Cry 4 in steam for 9,99€ and want to download it? Come back in a week. Want to watch porn? More like a dia-show! Want to browse Reddit? Watch those pictures load. If you want to be really evil you could give everyone a working 16k-connection, too.	To have an invisible, undying gang of mosquitoes (think 5-10) following them around everywhere. They don't bite, they just buzz around the ears incessantly.
What is the weirdest/creepiest thing that has ever happened to you at work?	well i unpack webster packs at a pharmacy and i was alone in the back room and the phome kept ringing then when it got to the answering machine it was just static. O.o	first day volunteering at a hospital. I took the elevator down to the lowest level (below the basement) because that is where my department was. I step out of the elevator and nobody is around. The lights are flickering and I am already kind of scared. it doesn't look like a hospital down there at all. it is a really industrial looking building, everything is exposed, concrete floors and walls, radiation warnings on doors. all of the sudden some nursery music starts playing over the loud speakers. and this point I am scared as fuck and just start walking to the department, I finally see people and calm down. It wasn't till after I got hired months later that I found out the music plays whenever a baby is born.
What's the biggest culture shock you've ever experienced?	Being white and moving to a Black neighborhood in Philly from a small farming community. I was shocked by the amount of trash, everywhere! People just throwing it on the ground as they walked down the street. Just really scum of the earth people.	Moved from Romania to the UK and while I was familiar with british culture and had no problem integrating I was really shocked when people were thanking the bus driver when getting off at their stop. Soon enough I started doing the same and once I moved back to Romania and kept doing that people gave me the oddest looks.
[Serious] Experts of Reddit, what are some red flags that a person discussing your field doesn't actually know what they're talking about?	When I hear another mother gloat about taking away their kids' Internet access for an extended period of time as a punishment. You took away the single greatest teaching tool known to mankind from your child as a punishment because it also happens to be fun? Yeah, you don't know what you're doing. You're just making pointless and damaging power plays.	Language teacher here. When someone insists that toddlers are too young to learn English. When did you start learning your first language?! The worst part, besides annoying me, is that this attitude raises generations who view a foreign language as essentially the same as high school biology. It's counterproductive as fuck.
What weird coping mechanisms do you have?	I find another homo sapiens, make some weird sounds with my mouth , she/he makes some weird sounds with her or his mouth, usually this goes on for a while and when we are done I usually feel much better.	I mentally zoom out of the building I am in, the town, the state, the country, the continent then the planet and try and let myself see how insignificant it all is.
Waiters and waitresses of restaurants that offer crayons to children, what’s the weirdest thing you’ve seen a child draw?	My kid at age 8 drew a person with an orange face and yellow hair. She labelled it President Trump and explained to our waitress that Trump was orange and looked like a giant Cheeto. The waitress asked to keep the picture :)	I work as a waiter in Harvester. An 8-10 year old boy simply wrote 'mum is arsehole' on one of our drawing pads.
Which celebrity has done the biggest 180, either good or bad?	Chris Pratt comes to mind, he wasn't on a downturn of any sort but just wasn't really on the radar.	There's an episode of the Simpsons with Mel Gibson playing himself and he's universally beloved. In that same episode, while driving through Hollywood, they point out Robert Downey Junior having a shoot out with the police, and Bart comments, "I don't see any cameras." Robert Downey Jr was the punchline, and Gibson was beloved. That's a total 180.
Redditors who realized their spouse is a completely different person after marriage, were there any red flags that you ignored while dating? If so, what were they?	If she has no self-control over eating, she WILL blimp out once she is married and will give no fucks about changing it.	There were a million red flags, but I ignored all of them. How they treat literally everyone else will be how they treat you. If they lied to everyone, you can bet they do it to you too. I am an idiot, but now hopefully a wiser idiot. Probably not though. Keep walking into the same brand of rake.
Historically, what stands out as one of the worst military blunders?	1. Never get involved in a land war in Asia. 2. Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line.	When Scotland decided to attack a weakened, Black Plague stricken England. They brought the plague home with them, and wiped out a big portion of their own population.
What did the weird kid do at your school that you will never forget?	Ripe eighth grade Jmanfro used to bring his 3DS to homeroom to destroy the smelly classmates in good old Smash Bros fuckery. One weird kid who had temper issues borrowed another kids 3DS to play me. Eighth grade me didnt realize that it would be in my best interest to let him win. The match lasted about a minute then the kid let loose. He threw the other kids 3DS then ran up to me, stuck his face in my face, and yelled "IM GOING TO KILL YOU ONE DAY" then naruto ran his ass out of there. Its been 4 years and I think ive escaped his wrath. Edit: Sorry forgot this was reddit I gotta be a little clearer it was 3 years ago oops!	I remember walking into the elementary school toilet room to find a "slow" kid shitting in the urinal. What made it memorable was that he was laughing his head off. I asked him "What's so funny" and he said the cold water tickled his butt!" *edit* this happened almost 40 years ago and I was wondering what ever happened to the kid. Google says he died in 1992 at the age of 20. Sad... but he's remembered.
You find a magical notebook and everything you write turns becomes reality. What do you write first?	"This book belongs to me and will now only be able to be used by me." "Peaceful aliens come to Earth, take over our governments, and create world peace & good living conditions for all people." "When I reach 30 years of age, my body will stay the same age and I will become immortal and unable to die in any way."	*I'm the only one who can see, touch, and write in this book* The second thing I would write is *I have an "undo" option for whatever I write to take me back to the moment right before I wrote the thing that I want to undo*. Edit- 3rd thing I would write- *I will never lose this book*, thanks /u/DillPixels
What is your best "So, this is how I die" moment?	Fell thirty or so feet while sliding on the railings of a particularly high staircase, was saved by my ridiculously huge bag somehow looping up and cushioning my head. Of course it was most likely the bag that pulled me down in the first place. All i could think of was "Let's see those fucking thieving cleaners clean *this* one up." Edit: Why downvotes? Edit 2: I come off as an asshole yeah, but did you even consider that maybe the cleaners had actually been stealing my stuff?	I was working in a lab one smoldering hot summer and left at the same time as an older girl who worked there. Both our cars were in the same lot so we walked together along the sidewalk and I started talking about Zaxbys for some reason. I don't know how the conversation progressed but at some point I made a joke she didn't like and she gave me a playful elbow. Maybe the elbow was less than playful, or maybe I spazz out at female body contact, but i topple off the sideway into the bikelane as a bus is passing by. All I feel is a massive WOOSH and i thought of those god damn coors beer train commercials. That could have been my last fucking thought. TL;DR: Was literally thrown under the bus, though about coors as I almost died.
What is a good sentence to use to exit a conversation at a party?	When it's my turn to speak, I say something to wrap up the talk, followed by a "Nice meeting you". There's no need to be rude.	Do as Costanza does: leave on a high note. Tell a great joke, and while they're laughing you say "That's it for me, have a good one!" And move on. You end the conversation, and they remember you as a comedic genius who will always get invited to future parties. It's gold, Jerry! Gold!
Guys, what is the one thing a girl could do that would melt your heart?	Give me a weekend to play Xbox with my friends, like work text them and see when they’re free and then give me a whole night/ weekend of online gaming. Bonus points if you provide snacks and drinks.	My wife and I are coming up on 30 years together. Romance isn't exactly the same. I had a really bad day at work and I (very wrongly) took it out on her and then went into my office to sulk and heard the front door close. Immediately I felt regret and knew she had gone on a walk to "cool off" before telling me off. Twenty minutes later the front door open and she comes in to my office and before I could apologize she threw and ice cream sandwich at me. I said "I'm sorry" and she said "eat your fucking ice cream sandwich" and the day became way better.
What is the most expensive thing you've broken?	I've broken my grandfathers vintage rolex watch, i dropped it when i was looking at it, considering its quite old, it just stopped working, i think it was around 700,000 dollars in value.	I reversed an ATV into the side panel of a vintage Porsche when I was 16 years old. The panel had to be replaced, and therefore no longer made it an original. The owner has hated my guts ever since.
What turns you on but are too scared to tell your SO?	I really want my SO (f) and I to have a three-way with one of my good friends (f). My friend has a bangin' body and we've made out before, and do every so often, it's so hot. My SO is very vanilla, though, and doesn't seem very curious. It's hurts sometimes just thinking about it.	I really like watching solo stuff. I want to watch my boyfriend masturbate, or hump a pillow, or fuck a melon or something weird. When he goes down on me and he thrusts against the bed a little.... ugh. Yes. Something about the desperation in it maybe. Edit- rip inbox, as expected. To clarify, he knows I love to watch him, just not the inanimate object thing. But thanks to you all I told him. And he said he'd fuck a melon for me. 10/10 confession
I quit my job after telling off a four year old for shaking his cup at me. What's the dumbest thing that has set you off at work?	I dated this girl for six years. I had intentions of buying a ring. Two weeks before we were supposed to visit her folks upstate (which I had decided was a good time to ask her father for his blessing) she dumped me, claiming that she just didn't see our relationship going anywhere. That would have been nice to know, oh, I don't know, *sometime in the last 5 years..*	Not me, but an acquaintance. She was worked at a grocery store in the produce section for a few years. She was stocking the bananas and a customer came up to her, grabbed a bunch of bananas, held it up and said rather sharply, "These bananas are green!" To which she clapped her hands and said, "Very Good." Got Fired
What was your “the show must go on” moment?	I said something weird on sex. “Waldo had found a way out, IN AND OUT” Eh, she was weirded out but not that much.	In 5th grade my friends and I would hit each other with plants we found on the ground, and apparently one plant was poison ivy. My face swelled up starting at my forehead and went down to my cheeks. My eyes swole almost completely shut. That Sunday I was one of the leads at an easter play we did. It was a 45 minute show with a couple of monologues. I just put on a baseball cap backwards to cover up my forehead and help pull my eyes open. Somewhere I still have the photos of my face. Looking back at it, I don't get how I still managed to have the willpower to go on, but somehow I convinced my parents to let the show go on.
What's your best story about getting paid to do nothing?	Whenever I work at my dads company I only sit on my ass and get paid 50€/h just for being there. From time to time I tell to intern to bring me coffee or scream at the incompetent warehouse workers. Next time I'm there I should ask dad why I even get paid to be there.	I did a local commercial in Ohio for McDonalds. They dressed me in a different shirt....same jeans I had on and told me to wait. I waited 45 min while they set up the shot. It was 3 seconds of footage. I would be sitting down for the whole thing. All I had to do was grab a burger box thing and slide it toward myself. Total of 3 hours of work. Of that, an estimated 1.5 hours of nothing with 1.5 hours of sitting and smiling. It's 3 years later and every year I get a check for the commercial because they keep running it. It's like a second tax rebate. Easiest money I ever made.
What's the ballsiest thing you've ever seen someone do?	Last night I saw a general who became a slave. The slave then became a gladiator. The gladiator (still the same f**king guy) defies the f**king emperor!! And, oh yeah... he wins.	I watched a guy steal a girl's iPod and, as he ran off, she threw her backpack like you'd do a hammer toss and nailed him in the back of the head. She casually caught up to him, picked up her backpack and iPod, and returned to where she was standing.
How do you distinguish a genuinely nice person from someone who's faking it?	People who smile or laugh with you then drop that the second they turn away from you. Know a few ppl who do this and they are F A K E	Time. They will eventually reveal who they are one way or another (especially when they think no one is looking). Trust your instincts. But know that no one is perfect and even genuinely nice people don't live up to it 100 % of the time.
What game would you call a perfect 10?	Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Modern Warfare 2. They are two of the building blocks of nearly all first person shooters. They were so good that multiplayer has stayed fairly active for both and the franchise has found success by making only minor changes to these games.	I absolutely LOVED The Legend of Zelda, Twilight Princess. I do wish it were more difficult but the story was so captivating and beautiful and it was so dark for a Zelda game it drew me in from the beginning.
Parents of Reddit with a homosexual child/children, what was your initial reaction upon their coming out?	If I had a gay child, I'd be very disappointed (I'm a Christian and I believe that it should be one man and one woman, not two of one). However this is one aspect I'd focus on a lot and I would teach my children against gay marriage.	My college roommate told me that when he came out to his mother, she asked "So what is buttsex like? Your father keeps pressuring me for it."
What small habits make life easier?	Assume everyone deep down is a selfish, lying thief who only conforms to society's expectation of civility because everyone else puts aside their transgressions to secure their own place in this twisted, facade we call humanity.	Tidy up and clean things straight away. It’s amazing how quickly your home turns into a dump if you don’t keep on top of it.
Reddit, I just graduated from high school. What are some lessons you learned the hard way in college?	If you go to ATO you can get as many fizzy drinks as you want, FOR FREE! And man those things are potent! Sometimes all it takes is one and you can't remember what happened for the rest of the night!	for the love of god and all that is holy DO NOT BUY TEXTBOOKS FROM THE CAMPUS STORE. Look up your courses, look up what books you need, and order them off amazon for 90% less than what the racketeers at your college wouldve charged you. you can easily save 500$ or more a semester
do guys really like it when girls make the first move?	Yes make The first move into the kitchen and make me a sandwich. But seriously, yes, please make the first move.	Rejection is a regular thing for men. So of course it is amazing when a girl comes on to us. 90% of the time when an average guy wants to make a move on a girl, he talks himself out of it due to fear of rejection/embarrassment. Do you like it when a guy you are very interested in asks you out? That feeling goes both ways. If you are interested in him and he seems like he might possibly be interested In You, go for it. You'll make his day. Edit: while SOME women seem to be used to getting hit on and revel in shooting men down. Even if you make a move on a guy and he isn't into it, he will be pretty flattered and let you down easy with no harm done. it's nice to be the one who feels desired for once.
Former addicts of Reddit, what do they not tell you about sober life?	It's less fun and sucks, and the only reason anyone does it is to survive longer than you would as an addict.	People say it's wonderfull, you get your life together and everything is sugar and rainbow. Sobriety is a bitch, being an addict is like taking your life and smashing it to the ground in a million pieces, being sober is like picking up the pieces one by one, trying to fix the whole thing, but it's endless, you're an emotionnal mess, psychologically, you're barely there, and you bitch while trying to get the whole thing together, you keep bitching "WHY do i even bother, it sucks", but if you hold on to it, if you keep pushing it, after a while you'll overlook all the things that you've done and finally say "Yep, it was worth it". It takes a while to get over to the happy part of being sober, took me months.
[Serious] Conservatives of reddit, this is a pretty liberal place. Do you ever run across misconceptions/misrepresentations of your political ideolagy?	The biggest thing is being called misogynist for not wanting to be forced to provide for women. All the women's "issues" center around how much men should be providing for women. Although I will concede that the screeching about it all the time has made me fairly misogynist, I don't respect a segment of the population that views the other segment financially supporting them as a fundamental right	All the time. We are assumed to be racists, bigotted, anti-anything. Instead of polite discource there is endless rudeness and insulting. However, I know that neither side is 100% innocent of that. So it get's really tiring, no one wants an honest conversation where both sides get's respected. And that's just sad.
Armored truck drivers of Reddit, what's it like? Any close calls?	Not an armored truck driver but I am a candy cane expert and one time me nan shoved me up into her cunt Sauce: Bolognese	Well, this story sort of fits in here. My grandfather drove one of the armoured trucks many many years ago. He had a psycho wife, and four kids, and they were always poor and just scraping by. One day he simply had enough of it, went to work a few minutes earlier than usual, checked out for the keys, and drove off before his partner had arrived. (Back then, security was way more lax than nowadays). He drove the van straight back to his house, removed one bag of money, loaded the family up, and went to the airport. They spent two weeks in an all inclusive 5-star resort in Spain, lounging like the rich on a beach. When they went home, he drove straight to the police station and handed himself in. Because of all the cirumstances, he only spent 2 years in prison for that.
What is the strangest subreddit you have encountered?	r/frenworld and r/honkler wildly obvious pseudo hate speech flimsily disguised as baby talk and weird pepe the clown memes. Because nothing says "owning the libs" like acting like edgy tweens I guess.	r/HaveWeMet is by far the strangest, and kinda wholesome thing I have seen on Reddit. FYI it's basically a bunch of randoms that act as neighbors in a small town, like they all know each other
What's the worst case of over-sharing you've experienced on social media?	I cringe every time a pregnant woman posts something about their unborn child. Something along the lines of 'Circumcision is horrible! When my child is born I won't have him circumcised!' Like wtf.. You're talking about your unborn child's genitalia.. for the entire world to see. I just feel it's morally irresponsible for the parent. I could see a lot of bullying coming from it. Kids are mean af.	Some girl was bragging to her rival ho that she stole her man and posted a pic of his dick, rival ho replies with "nah that ain't him, THIS is what his dick looks like" and posted another dick pic, first girl decides to post more to compare. Ended up posting about a dozen dick pics from what seemed like 4-6 different men, trying to out-hoe each other.
What plothole in a movie has always bothered you?	Interstellar.(SPOILERS, obviously) The entire plot of the movie is that futuristic "evolved" humans open a wormhole back in time to the other planets to save the human race. But that's a paradox. The wormhole only exists because the humans put it there, and the humans only exist because of the wormhole lets the earth humans survive. The only explanation is that there is another timeline all together in which the humans survived anyway and went on to evolve into the super futuristic humans without the wormhole. Which means there's no point to the movie whatsoever because the humans live anyway.	In School of Rock the Battle of the Bands is in the middle of a school day. Who attends that?
I loved playing "The Penis Game" on the school bus as a wee lad (details inside). What ridiculous things did you do as a child that you now reflect upon with warm memories?	We played a game very identical until one of our teachers was convicted of Paedophilia. Then we play 'Paedo'. Happy days.	I prefer the hardcore version of this game... It basically the same thing cept replace bus with airport and penis with bomb.
Women of reddit, what is the craziest thing you have ever seen at a bachelorette party?	Not me but a friend. Stripper shows up with face mask dildos where your mouth would be. Gets a guy or two to fuck her with it. Then tells my friend to lay on the ground face up with it on. She squats on his face and starts bouncing up and down. Well she finally got off him and he's unconscious. Apparently the bouncing and hitting his head on the ground repeatedly gave him a concussion and he had to go to the hospital.	A stripper tried to do a cool move where he did a roundhouse over another girls head. Except he kicked her. She got a concussion and threw up in a trashbag the entire limo ride to the hospital.
You are going to receive 3k usd a month for the rest of your life. What do you do?	- Youtube Channel - Photography Blog - Daily Twitch Stream. I'll split my days into 4 parts. - Sleep - Going outdoors to take photos and videos - Editing of above-said photos and videos and uploading them - Streaming video games on Twitch That's my current retirement plan.	Put 1k a month into a savings account, pay rent and bills with the rest, figure out what I'd like to do with my life now I don't have to worry about 95% of my daily stresses.
What's the biggest lie taught in schools?	Sex is for marriage. If you do it before then, you'll burn in hell. Yeah, Catholic schools need to change that policy. Nobody gives a shit what the Vatican says about sexuality anymore. And restricting access to birth control just creates a whole slew of problems, including more abortions. IDK, but I'm pretty sure the Church would like to decrease abortion rates...	Middle school : when you get to high school you won't be able to turn in work late High school : your college professors definite won't accept anything past the deadline Both turned out to be bullshit in my experience
What is the most fucked up book you have ever read? Why?	The Cat and The Hat. I don't know how people honestly think Dr. Seuss books are for kids , I always get weirded out by them.	American Psycho. There's a lot of stuff in the book that was left out of the film because it was just too explicit, including a scene where a guy smears cheese all over a prostitute's vagina and unleashes a half-starved rat at her genitals.
What can you do to avoid masturbating when you're horny?	Why avoid masturbating? Done in private or with another consenting adult, it's perfectly natural and a great way to releave stress.	Cut up some hot peppers without gloves. If you're still tempted, you could always rub your eyes for some distraction.
What was the most fucked up thing that you witnessed in a school hallway?	I live in the suburbs of a decent sized city. Kids with some money go here. Generally not much trouble. For some reason lately in my school (where some kids are bussed from downtown) have started playing Street craps. Like you walk in a stair case or a bathroom and kids are shooting dice. For us suburban sheltered kids this is crazy and a little scary. Teachers try to catch them but they just grab their dice and runaway.	This kid in a wheelchair had a service dog. Everyone knew not to play with it or even touch it. One day, the dog picked up a bag of cheezits. Then, the most annoying girl in school (always trying correcting teachers/students, trying to fix problems that weren't hers) decides to wrestle the bag from the dog. The dog thinks it's a game, and since the dog doesn't get to ever play, it gets a little excited and starts rolling around and peeing. The girl is rolling around on the ground with the dog and getting covered with dog piss. Once she finally got the bag, the bag was empty. The teacher obviously wouldn't let her in class after that cause of all the piss.
As an Australian who doesn't really watch the news often, the only time i really see anything from FOX news is when i watch The Daily Show and while i know its a news parody im curious, is FOX news really as biased as The Daily Show makes it out to be or is it merely quotes taken out of context?	The Daily Show tends to use clever editing to make things appear worse than they are, but in the case of Fox News very little editing is required. They really are that bad.	Since the advent of the 24 hour news cycle, most news agencies have been sensationalizing the news to create controversy, and in turn, increase ad revenue. Fox news just happens to do this to a certain extreme.
What instantly ruins your day?	Couples at the gym. Whether they're making out on the bench or actually spotting each other, you are a reminder of what I will never achieve lifting and only lift harder.	When you are sarcastic with your wife first thing in the morning for a joke, but she is still grumpy so she tells to stop being rude and you're like shit, sorry, I wasn't being rude, it was a joke and then it turns into a fucking argument about who is going to the grocery store later
What's the biggest thing you've forgiven someone for?	My ex wife fucking my coworker, some guy she flew out to my home on my dime and a few other guys while I was deployed. She still took everything. Fuck her. She's going to be a fat fucking pear when she has children anyway. Good riddance.	I haven't done it in person and he doesn't know, but I've forgiven the man driving the garbage truck that backed over and killed my college girlfriend. It was an accident. In reading the news stories about the incident I saw he was hospitalized for extreme emotional distress afterwards and I couldn't bring myself to hate him or blame him for something that was clearly an accident. If I can forgive the man who killed the first person I've ever loved, I like to think I can forgive almost anyone.
What’s the weirdest thing to happen to you in a public bathroom?	Pissing next to a guy during a play in my local theatre. Guy glances at little Ronnylicious and excitedly nods his head whilst revealing a big grim. He says I should be proud. I start to blush. He says it is okay for me to look as well, so I peek. He has a beautiful black King Dong and I ask him "*Is it okay if we switch hands while we finish?*" he says it is fine. I feel the urine pulsing through his Johnson. Was the greatest euphoria I've ever felt ^^^SecondPartDidNotReallyHappenBtw	Was at college needed to a quick break went to the bathroom for a leak. As I finished pissing I heard someone in one of the stalls whispering help repeatedly, asked if he was all right and he said he needed help with something. Was naturally a little sketched out and almost walked out but I went over anyways. I had to crawl under the stall. He ended up being a paraplegic who had fallen while trying to get into his chair, dick hanging out and all. I had to lift him from the floor to his wheelchair. It was a little awkward but I’m glad I helped him out god knows how long he would have laid there. He said thank you and I never saw him again.
Men of Reddit - have you ever been cat called in public? How did you feel about it? Does this even happen to guys?	I'm a former pro runner.....that means shorty shorts in public. I get cat called by women normally once a week or so. I wish more women would cat call guys. It's pretty awesome. Women, do all the cat calling you want.....men like it.	I’ve got green-blue eyes, and given I’ve got a Mediterranean colouring, my eyes are really brought out, so I should be used to having comments by women over the years about my eyes but I actually get really embarrassed when it happens. It’s more awkward for me it’s one of the first things they say to me because I just feel put on the spot and don’t know where to go from there.
What was "the moment" you realized a friendship or relationship was toxic and you needed to get out?	We wanted to watch a movie and he suggested one he had already watched before. That time i liked a girl that started dating another dude so i was sad about it In the movie there were 2 dudes flirting with the same girl, the cool guy and the nerdy guy. My friend stand up and came over my shoulder and pointed with his finger saying "you are this dude (the nerdy guy) and the other dude (the cool guy) is the guy that stole your girl I got very sad because of his move... he compared me with a loser (the movie was a comedy so the dude was a total loser so that he was funny) in a personal issue instead of being supportive.	We were out together at a bar when these guys approached us. The guy she was more interested in was paying more attention to me than her so she started a physical fight with me to get his attention. She literally just walked over totally unprovoked and slapped me across the face. She ended up getting us both kicked out. Since I was her ride I drove her home and never spoke to her again.
People who found the reddit account of people they know in real life, what's the weirdest/most shocking thing you found in their profile?	Nothing because I'm not a snooping fuck. I don't people doing that to me, so I don't do it to them	One of my favorite university professors has been on reddit forever. Like since 2006 or something. We found his username and discovered he was the moderator of a very silly cat meme subreddit. Probably made him even more likeable after that haha.
What is your "rudest stranger Ive ever met" story?	A woman at Walgreens was asked how hold her baby was, She replied "27 months". So I burped in her face and slashed her tires out of principle. I imagine she'd say I'm the rudest stranger I've ever met.	I was driving home and a girl and her boyfriend pull up to the car next to me and I hear a girl tell her boyfriend "That girl is ugly, tell her she's ugly." And he yells at me, leaning out of his car. "Hey! *You're ugly!" I actually drove out of my way to get away from them.
What's the most pain you've ever experienced?	When I had to say goodbye to my ex as she was moving overseas. That hurt so god damn much. Also getting a cactus stuck in my arm one time.	I had hot oil poured into a boot and got my left foot deep fried. The skin on my foot is still all weird and rubbery. (It was a freak accident cleaning out the deep fryer at a restaurant.)
Redditors who used craigslist for NSFW services how did it go?	I've used Craigslist quite a bit over the years for random hookups. Being gay cruising is still a huge aspect of it, but instead of rest stops or airport bathrooms it's moved more so online. I've used Craigslist for *years* and have made quite a few good, erm, "friends". I pretty much have my own harem going on at this point. This last weekend actually I hooked up with a few of them.	Posted my ad. She came over. We did the do. She stole the salmon I had in my fridge. 6/10 would try again.
What are good tips, for living on your own for the first time?	Don't waste, your commas. You threw away a perfectly good comma in this headline for no reason. Those add up and by the end of the month you won't have any commas left. Also, if you type comma a bunch of times it no longer has any meaning.	Try to save all the money you can, learn how to cook and try to not buy all the "cheap" things that you like
When I find a hair in my food, I take it out and continue eating. What kinda of non-issues do you think people make a big deal out of?	People in committed relationships who wanna fuck other people. (SHOCKER!!!) Nothing to see here, folks. Monogamy is horseshit. Move along.	When I used to work in a supermarket, I found so many people were weird about buying toilet paper/feminine hygiene/condoms. Toilet paper shouldn't be an issue because everyone shits, feminine hygiene shouldn't be an issue because ~~more than half the population~~ many women menstruate~~s~~ and condoms shouldn't be a problem because at least you're getting some. EDIT: Yes, I realise I was incorrect stating half the population menstruate. I acknowledged this below and I have apologised. You don't need to keep telling me.
How do non Americans feel about the North Korean and US stand off?	What stand off? This is the exact same shit that's been going on for the past 30 years. Only whereas previously the USA had intelligent presidents they now have one who is dumb as a rock.	South Korean here. We live our daily lives and we don't even give a single fuck about the situation. N. Korea has been doing what they are doing right now for my entire life anyways.
[Serious] Male victims of sexual assault, harassment, or rape, to clear some common misconceptions, what were your experiences like?	I was going to write a very nasty jaded expletive rant that used words that are very unkind towards large women, thus I feel it's best if I just keep my mouth shut.	The worst part was not what my cousin did to me, but how my family dealt with it: My aunt (his mother) gaslighting me and telling me I had a bad dream. My mother telling me that somebody must have done it to him so he thought it was okay to do to me. Years later he got married, his wife caught him raping their infant son, and she stabbed him to death.
Why is free elementary/middle/high school considered normal but free/inexpensive college is considered socialism?	I love how the majority of the people labeling it as a socialist program are Republicans. No hand outs for the regular Americans, the people that voted you monsters into power. Let's just give ~~hand outs~~ tax cuts to the rich and bail out corporations. In the Republican/Corporate Democrat mindset, this is in no way a hand out because rich people don't get hand outs *cough cough bullshit* Republicans: "A free college for all program would cost the US too much money!", "But the deficit!" Just the increase of our military budget from 2016 to 2017 would be more then fucking enough to fund free college for all. Now to answer your question. Because the people representing our government have interests to serve the top 1% and faceless corporations rather then the people.	Many people have already pointed out the child vs adult thing. But I haven't see the other part yet. We as a society decided that in order to have a healthy functional society we would need every citizen educated to a certain level. Which was graduating high school. Since this was seen as mandatory it needed to be provided. College on the other hand was for people who decided they wanted more for themselves and pushed themselves further. But that is a personal choice you get to make and if you make that choice the consequences of those decisions (including financial) are on you not everyone else.
[serious] How do you make friends with no existing social circle?	First, identify the issues that led you being in your late 20's with no friends. Was it unlikeable personality traits? Work on eliminating them. Low self-esteem? Hit the gym, get fit, feel better about yourself. Lack of common interests? Go to meetup.com and find groups that share the ones you have, then actually attend meetups. Just plain not a social person? Then don't worry about a social circle, spend your free weekends hiking, or going to see movies.	* If you get invited to something, go. * If you hear about some interesting event happening (TedX, Greek Festival, politician coming to campaign), go. * Find interesting meetup groups, then go. * Be friendly to everyone you meet. It's awkward at first, but get used to saying hi and introducing yourself to complete strangers. * Learn to strike up a conversation. Use something situational like "that last band was way too loud!" that is easy to dis/agree with. * Do *not* hit on women if you are a straight guy looking for friends. * If you meet someone cool, invite them to join you for coffee to at another relevant event. * If someone says "nice meeting you!" and is heading off, be ready with your card and say something (like extending the aforementioned invitation).
What WOULD you wish on your worst enemy?	A child with severe physical and/or mental issues, so therefore their entire life is tied up caring for someone they love, but they are so emotionally and physically exhausted that they get little to no pleasure out of life, but cannot complain to anyone because they would appear to be a monster for resenting their own child.	They have to live a second lifetime in a world that would have resulted if everybody on Earth were just like them.
Redditors who have had comments gilded, without giving context, what was the comment?	Someone asked what the oldest comment to receive gold was. All I said was "not this one" and was gilded less than thirty seconds later.	In elementary school, there was a pencil machine in the front lobby where you could get pencils for 25 cents. There were also "special" pencils that had stars on them. If you got one of these special pencils, you could take it into the office and get a prize. One day, I decided to get a pencil. I put in my quarter and out popped TWO pencils. And one of them was a special pencil! I went into the office and told the lady at the desk that the machine gave me two pencils and one of them was special. She proceeded to say that the machine shouldn't do that, took the special pencil, and didn't give me a prize. That was 15 years ago and I'm still pissed.
People who jog on the street next to the sidewalk, why?	Ppl shouldn't be running on the street or sidewalk. Find some grass or a clay track. Save your back, hips, knees and ankles	I asked that question to a coworker who does this. She explained that the asphalt has more cushioning than the concrete on the sidewalk. So it's less strain and fatigue on the joints in the legs.
What makes you mad every time you see it?	Negligent driving. I just came back from Goulburn and some fucker cut me off and nearly made me crash my brand new Range Rover Evoque Sport. If I see that fuckwit driver, I'll LEGIT burn his shit Holden Commodore down.	People leaving their shopping carts in the middle of a parking space in a crowded lot instead of returning them to the collection area.
What is some conversation etiquette that more people need to know?	Listen more often than you speak. Obviously *everyone* can't do this, but for the limited amount of people who will see this, try it.	If someone gets interupted by someone, whenever that person is done, cut back to the other person and say "hey sorry, what were you saying?" People really appreciate finishing their thought.
Women of Reddit: What is one style/clothing mistake men do that you find horrible?	What's that hair-do where it's like a pompadour but with either side shaved off? like poofy Mohawk. Ew. That, and extra long hair I find particularly off-putting. I don't care how edgy it is.	Premature manbuns. These guys with a single pigtail atop their head and just in complete denial that to accomplish the hairstyle you actually need the hair itself..
Reddit, what's the weirdest phone call you have ever received?	So, I was making out with my gf one time when my phone rang. I answered, and the guy on the other end asks what I'm doing with his daughter. I tell my gf that her dad has called me. That's when she tells me her father was dead...	Last spring, I tweeted something to the effect of, "I wish I could do my homework outside, but there's no where to plug my laptop into." Almost immediately after, I got a phone call from a number I didn't recognize, with a creepy voice saying, "We've got outlets in the treeeeeeeessss."
Non-English folk, what part of British culture do you not understand?	I don't understand the hate between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland. Shouldn't the catholics just emmigrate to Ireland if they hate being Prosecuted? And what's with the violence? Christianity should be peaceful, especially between two christian groups.	In regards to indian food- is it really that popular? If it is, I've heard that it's been given sort of the same treatment as mexican food here in the US. Like, you can get real mexican from a taco truck or family restaurant, OR you can get 'tex-mex', an americanized version. Both are widespread and well-liked. Is that the case, or is it pretty much authentic?
Poor swimmers and casual drowners of Reddit, what are some of your (not-so-pleasant) memories of being in water?	The worst one happened a few years ago. I was at a waterpark and I went on a waterslide, as you do, and I didn't realize how deep the water in the "landing pool" was. It took me a good 15 seconds to get to the surface. I felt so stupid for almost drowning myself, and my paranoid little self imagined everyone laughing at me. I never really liked swimming/water in general, but that kept me on land for good.	Being pulled down by an undercurrent, watching the light fade from the surface, looking down into an infinite pit of darkness and thinking to myself "so this is how I'm going to die..." ...Also water up the nose. Hate that so much. ^((Edit: Okay, some people want more context. I was clinically dead for 2 minutes, was pulled out of the river around 240 yards downstream, and resuscitated, but the water messed with my lungs and I "drowned" again on the helicopter ride to the hospital, technically dying again for 2 more minutes. That's just the information I was given.)^) ^^Edit^2 ^^: ^^wording
Has Reddit completely abandoned reddiquette or are there those out there who still moderate based on content, not opinion?	We're a dying breed. It is sad how pleased it makes me to see a heated debate where nobody has been downvoted.	> even this thread will likely get downvoted to all hell because it points the fact out. Ha. Haha. Hahahahaha. AHAHAHAHAHAHA. Heh. Ahem. I don't think you understand how much Reddit like criticizing Reddit. That is all. Also? This has been done time and time again. You're not like, a martyr or anything. People point out why Reddit sucks all the damn time and they get upvoted so don't think this is any bit more special than those times.
It's that time of the year, Reddit. What were some of the best Reddit comments of 2011?	Given Reddit's attention span and fleeting memory, all of these awards, comment of the year included, but especially novelty account of the year, are actually "best comment of the past two months."	I don't remember where it was originally posted, but a girl was speaking about being an escort, and a user with a silly name congratulated her on being so mature about the whole thing, and another user commented something along the lines of, "from the authority on maturity, farty_McPoopus." Cracked me up.
Redditors who have had "neighbors from hell", what happened?	One of them tried to hurt my dog by throwing bricks at her and feeding her food which would make her sick. My sister and I totaled his car. He did it again so then we spread a rumor in the neighborhood that he was a pedo. He left within a week and we never saw him again. I don't think we'd do it again but you really shouldn't screw with a 6 year olds dog.	The woman who had my old apartment before me used to feed all the neighborhood skunks causing them to constantly hang around my dimly lit apartment building. My then boyfriend used to have to carry a flashlight to avoid startling one and getting a faceful of stink.
A science accident transforms you perfectly into the opposite sex. You are told that changing back has a 5% chance of you dying horribly. Do you change back? Why or why not?	It's sad that when guys consider being female the factors are all sexual (I'd have boobs, I could get laid, etc.) It's like we don't even exist as human beings, just the concept of sex itself. I don't know how to escape being determinate in the eyes of others	if I didn't like being a woman then yeah, id switch back. 5% chance of dying? I don't see the downside.
What was a time when you showed up horribly overdressed/underdressed for something?	I was a new student at my high school, was previously home schooled and living abroad with my parents (Africa, etc). I was invited to a Halloween party by my new girl friends, this guy I liked was going to be there. I ended up dressing up as a corpse bride. Full makeup and costume, even false teeth! I didn't know it was a free pass to dress slutty (embarrassing)	My dad dressed us for a summer company picnic - matching velour v neck sweaters, collared shirt, corduroys. He told us to sit still and say please and thank you if spoken to. We drove more than an hour in an old station wagon with no air conditioning on a hot humid August day. Got to the company picnic and it was a pool party & bbq with kids running around in shorts and Company men kicking back a few cold ones.
What is the most flat out stupid way your company wasted your time and its money?	Sent every engineer 7000 miles away to the mother company for weeks at a time to learn how they do it. Like they were expecting a bunch of American born, bred, and trained engineers to do it the Korean way? Ha!	Had me rip out perfectly good carpet only to change their minds and want the office carpeted again. Edit: All within three hours.
What does the other gender just not understand, and it’s a waste of time to try and explain it to them?	Men. No, Susan, we're not all assholes. No, the best ones aren't all gay or taken (trust me, some of the gays are just as rancid). No, we're not all rapists and child molesters... No, we're not all women haters.... Susan.... Susan. Susan, this is why you're single and have twenty-six cats, Susan. CATS AREN'T LOVE, SUSAN!	Period cramps and getting kicked in the balls. It's near impossible to explain the feeling to the opposite sex lol
[Serious] What interaction with a stranger has been burned into your memory?	I mentioned to a lady that I was adopted. She said "You know what other kind of adoption you can do?" Me: "Uh....." she said nothing. Then she asked about my tattoo, I explained it too her. Her: "When you go to heaven and meet Jesus *they* tattoo your name on your soul and then you're reborn", she said this to me at work, with a group of her friends (who were ok with it) and then left. I just went "wat...." Now that I typed that out I think she's going to kill me... Oh god....	When I was 15 years old a man with long white hair knocked on my door. He then handed me my dad's wallet and said he had found it in the town bordering ours. He had biked about 20 kilometres just to return it.
What do your coworker(s) do that pisses you off?	Is there anything more annoying than sanctioned smoking breaks? You're allowed to decrease your productivity by 10% because you're addicted to killing yourself?	Oh, perfect timing for this. The girl in the cubicle next to me has been quietly listening to "Monster Mash" on repeat all morning. She has the volume turned down respectfully low, so I can't really ask her to turn it off, but I can still hear it. "They do the mash... *the monster mash!* they do the mash!..."
What is one conspiracy that you firmly believe in? and why?	9/11 was an inside job. If you examine the evidence for an inside job theory vs. the evidence available for the Bush administration's theory it is overwhelmingly in the favor of an inside job. What blows my mind is that there are so many people that refuse to believe the obvious, because as far as the Bush administration went to steal elections, proliferate war and rob the poor, and the honest man blind, 9/11 as an inside job is just too far.	Cinnabon vents their oven exhaust directly into the food court to increase sales. Can you smell the food from the Sbarro, Panda Express or McDonalds in the food court? Of course not. But you can smell the Cinnabon right when you enter, even though the food court is way at the opposite end of the mall. Sneaky bastards.
Reddit, what to do want to vent about?	I just went on a rant about the Captain Underpants movie. As we know, Hollywood is very unoriginal. My buddy says "oh I can't wait to see the Captain Underpants". I instantly go off. He's the reason Hollywood doesn't make new shit anymore. They know they can get suckers like him to just hop on the nostalgia train to money town. See a movie if it's good. But don't just go see some movie because Hollywood is trying to take advantage of your childhood. "I guarantee you that movie is garbage but people like you will give them money anyway" Look up Captain Underpants on Rotten Tomatoes to prove my point. It has an 86%. Fuck.	Fucking geese in this god damn fucking town. Every fucking day there's geese on my fucking way to work and all they do is shit everywhere and fucking attack anything that gets anywhere near them. If I see a bunch of fucking geese in the middle of the sidewalk (which there always fucking are cause they're fucking everywhere in this shithole of a town) then I have to either change my fucking route to work or have to be attack by big ass stupid bags of feathers and shit. FUCK
