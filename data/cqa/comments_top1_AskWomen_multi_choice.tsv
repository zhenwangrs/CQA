Have you ever “stuck out” a job for a few years, please share your experience, do you regret it or do you regret leaving if you didn’t “stick it out”?	Like, 90% of my "grown-up" jobs. I just sort of assumed that was what the first few years in a person's career *should* look like - utter hell. Honestly, even with that anticipatory mentality, I got jaded and drained and just totally fucked up from the stress of it all. Was it worth it? For most people, including me, the answer would be no. However, if you want to climb, there's no way of avoiding a certain amount of suffering. I felt like my own experiences just shattered my soul - I'm still trying to stitch myself up to date. Some of my colleagues, sure, they complained a lot. But, they stuck with it; they emerged from the fire stronger and more clearly-formed. Until you go through those experiences yourself, it's very difficult to know whether all the bullshit will wind up being meaningful or not.	I left after 6 weeks, I hated it, different job role to what I applied for, they told me on the day I started it was ‘slightly different’ now.	1
Have any women here given birth despite having Tokophobia or "fear of childbearing"?	I was terrified of being pregnant and especially the whole birth thing. Pregnancy sucked but it was mostly uncomplicated. Birth was the most traumatic thing I have ever endured. I ended up with a vacuum delivery, a 3c tear and all sorts of pelvic floor dramas. My daughter will be an only child. I am never going through that again. It was actually worse than I imagined it could be. The most upsetting thing is everyone telling me that I will change my mind and do it again. It seems that all the only children in the world can't possibly exist.	I don't have any kids nor have any desire atm or ever. But I do have a fear of giving birth. I have a host of health problems. One of which is I can not handle physical pain at all, and I don't want epidural due to the fact that it goes in the spine. I also have a thing about spines which grosses me out and I don't want to put something on it. I guess I'd go with a c section if I were to give birth. I just don't want to push for the fact that I could not handle the pain at all. I'd also have a fear that I would be unable to push out the baby due to my lack of muscle strength overall.	1
What's the biggest culture shock you've ever experienced or witnessed?	Evil Trump and Republicans in 2016. I had no idea that evil could win an election. Now that I know better I actually hate America and the Constitution itself because its like what if the Nazi party had more votes? America 2017 is what happens when Nazi Germany has more Nazi's then rational people who vote. We voted for Hitler in 2016 and I feel obligated to change America now. For the better, against Republicans aka the Nazi Party in America.	It took me a few days to work out that in America entrée means MAIN MEAL. Here, an entrée is the first, light course of the meal (similar to an appetiser), so i'd get these huge ass plates of food and be absolutely bewildered.	0
Have any of you encountered a PUA / Red Piller in the wild? How frequently do you come across them?	I have known a few guys who read TRP (well, not on reddit, but TRP type stuff). They weren't PUAs though. I didn't date them but I didn't find them awful. They had been majorly burned in the past and were trying to find their inner confidence. Trying to get a footing, rather. They were respectful to me, although who knows what they actually thought of me. It wasn't that bad. *shrugs* I liked talking to them about their experiences.	i was at a party in college and this guy kept telling me he had a magic trick that involved him stroking my hands for a really long time. i sat there for like 20 minutes waiting for the magic trick to happen and then he was like "now you're going to want to kiss me" or some shit and i was like...why? you just took 20 minutes of my time and there was NO FUCKING MAGIC TRICK. PUAs lie, guys.	0
Can you french braid your own hair?	Yes when my hair was longer. It took a bit to learn and yeah your arms will hurt but you can do it. I guess the trick is take it slow and use small chunks of hair slowly gathering more the more you braid. Practice makes perfect. Oh also, I learned to do it by feel and checking my work in a mirror after.	Weirdly, I find I do better if I don't use a mirror. The mirror just confuses things. It does take a lot of practice either way, or at least it did for me.	0
What's your favorite psychological theory or phenomenon?	The greater the inequality in laws toward women and the less women are allowed to participate in public life, the worse the male collective behaves internationally: everyone suffers. This is both psychological and anthropological.	I can't really explain why but object permanence (or a baby's lack thereof) always makes me giggle. I just picture a baby playing peekaboo going "oh my god mom no!"	0
How many of you would consider adoption over giving birth (if you want kids)?	That was my preference. We ended up having our own after going through several agencies and learning we were looking at ten years and piles upon piles upon piles of money before we even got a child. Having your own is far cheaper. Realize though that adopting and having your own are vastly different experiences, from start to finish. And no one should be guilted for recognizing that adopting a child with genetics that aren't yours and a possible slew of issues is far different than starting from zero with your own.	I want to have my own kids. I'm biracial and I'm in a relationship with a white guy and 3/4 white 1/4 black kids are kind of rare so I want to contribute to diversity.	1
What's it like to regret having a child?	> if you love your child extremely much, how is it possible to simultaneously regret it? They love their children, they just don't like being parents ( the responsibility, the cost, the loss of their time, and other sacraficies )	I also don't have kids and never want them. If I were pregnant it would ruin my life. But it would be unfair to place that blame on the child, you know? So those parents may feel the same. Their child ruined their life and their plans and if they could go back, they'd never have kids. But they're still trying to be the best parent they can be.	1
What's the female equivalent to "steak and a blow job"?	while reading the comments I realized.. there IS NO equivalent to "steak and a BJ" for women..every woman want's something else, men are simple creatures to satisfy, you give them a nice meal and a BJ and they're happy, but not for women... and I'll take a wild guess, even If a women had an equivalent for one situation, I'm pretty sure it changes when in another.	I still want a double dosing of red meat, so steak (medium rare) and a dicking would be delightful. Alas, I can't come up with any catchy alliteration to go along with it.	0
I'm 22 and I just found out I'm pregnant. I'm having an abortion. How should I mentally prepare myself?	I'm so sorry you're scared. Do you have a supportive close friend to go with you? It might help to have someone with you. Also wear a hoodie and sunglasses if you want some anonymity. Sometimes there are nasty protesters outside, but just remember that this is one day in your life, and it will be over just like every other difficult day you've had. I'd also get some delicious treats and indulge in something nice for yourself afterwards.	If you live in Miami or Fort Lauderdale and have no one to go with, PM and I'll accompany you. Don't be scared for being a responsible adult and making the right choice. You'll be fine :)	0
She's obese now. It kills me; what can I do?	If you are disgusted by her and you want to leave, then just do it. It kind of seems like you're basing a lot of your feelings about her on her appearance which is disgusting in itself imo. However, if you're not happy and you feel that it is not going anywhere, then leave. On another note, have you tried talking to her at all about this issue? Not just skirting around it, but a complete, up-front confrontation of the subject. Maybe there's something you don't know about or she is afraid to tell you. Why don't you try working out together?	Is this perhaps about attraction, more than it is about love? I remember a Simpson episode that stuck with me, where Homer gets incredibly fat and Marge says something in the lines of: *"I love you, but I'm no longer attracted to you"* For anyone to say something constructive on this, I think you should elaborate. Just a friendly tip :)	0
If you could rewrite the ending to your favorite fairy tale, children's story, or nursery rhyme, how would it go?	Mulan realizes she really prefers dressing as a boy, falls in love with a Geisha and becomes best bros with Shang.	Little Mermaid: She WRITES A LETTER to Eric saying that she made a deal with Ursula and she can't talk so if he kissed her that would be greeeaaat. And then they actually learn about each other. Then she decides for herself that damn, I fell for this dude just because of his pretty face but we don't get along well at all. She goes back to the ocean and apologizes to her dad because she is only 16 and a dumbass.	0
What has been the most romantic frugal date you have been on?	The only romantic date I've been on was to brunch In a Colombian cafe and then a tour of the chocolate factory next door. I wish I was attracted to him, or that I just dated him even though I wasn't.	I like to read, so he took me to the park and we got some drinks and I laid my head in his lap while he played with my hair and read to me from the book I was in the middle of. Probably the best date I've ever been on, honestly.	0
Women with anxiety, how do you deal with chronic worry, when your mind is fixated on one certain thing that you can’t stop overthinking/worrying about?	Unpopular opinion but...Honestly I hate posts like this. Filled with people saying "coloring books", "art", and "yoga". I'm not hating on anyone's way of dealing with stress but if you are actually mentally ill, these things won't help. And I'm down right fucking sick of being suggested little BS hobbies like that for my actually severe mental health issues (bipolar). The only thing that *marginally* helps is medication. *Maybe* therapy if you aren't in too deep.	Medication. I tried pretty much all the advice out there. I went through various CBT techniques. I tried distracting myself with fun hobbies or exercise. The one thing that finally made the difference was getting on daily medication.	0
What is your favorite physical attribute?	My hair. It's naturally three toned. It's thick and silky and lustrous. It sucks in the summer, but no one ever said being fabulous is easy.	The fact that such forces as gravity, inertia, and friction act upon me. Life would be rather difficult if they didn't.	1
What baby names do you despise?	Young moms you see on Maury that give their babies names they made up that people probably will have trouble pronouncing. It seems unfair for the kid. My name is normal and I had enough trouble getting teachers to say it right. My roommate's white sister did this with her biracial children. Her youngest is Xiamarah (if I'm spelling it right).	I dislike anything that seems like a fun name for the parent but will be awful or impractical for the kid when they're an adult. Like, Apple is a cute nickname and a cute name for a baby. But, that kid is eventually going to grow up and have to introduce herself as Apple. "Hi, I'm Apple Paltrow" just sounds ridiculous to me. I think too many parents want their kids' names to reflect how cool/quirky/unique *the parent* is and don't think about the fact that a name is usually a lifetime commitment and the kid is a separate person. "My daughter Apple" sounds like a thing a really interesting parent would say. "I'm Apple" doesn't sound like a thing a really interesting person would say.	0
What’s your most complimented perfume?	When I'm not wearing any. Srsly. People always tell me I smell great and ask what I'm wearing. It's usually Johnson and Johnson baby soap and cocoa butter.	I once spilled a french vanilla coffee on myself, and got more compliments about how good I smelled than any perfume I’ve ever worn...does that count?	0
what is the creepiest thing that has ever happened to you in your life?	I was 16 and got off at the wrong bus stop. A man who had been staring at me, muttering and snapping his fingers got off at the last minute with his massive suitcase. I got a bad feeling and took off running towards a bar at the end of the street and the scariest moment of my life is hearing those suitcase wheels speeding up behind me and his feet hitting the pavement. Luckily for me the bouncer at the bar was helpful and told creepy guy to turn around and walk the other way. Creepy guy tries to convince him that we knew each other and were just having an argument. Bouncer doesn’t care and asks a couple of his friends to follow this guy and make sure he doesn’t turn around and come back towards me. That unknown bouncer is on my list of heroes.	That's hard to say because I used to have some panic stuff \(you know, freeze up\). Probably going down into a supposedly haunted tunnel.	1
What is the most bizzare racial slur you've been called?	Working customer service at the time, I was called a McNigglet, definitely the most original one I've heard directed towards me	I am white and was called "just a white person", "you are just white people", "you do white people things like having bbqs". All this was said angrily to me when I told a friend I thought he was a womanizer and needed to get his act together (I should have just stayed out of it). I always thought that was odd.	1
What have the questions asked in this subreddit taught you about guys?	That dudes will always be praying that there is some all-encompassing answer that they can get from one woman that will help them understand the rest.	That there are guys out there who are even more sensitive or concerned about their interactions with the opposite sex than I am. I find that interesting somehow.	0
Older first-time mothers (35+), at what age did you have your first child? What are the challenges and benefits of having children late in life?	Age 36. One kid (one and done!). No problems conceiving at all. Kid is perfectly healthy except for the 7-going-on-17 sarcasm in full swing. Plenty of energy to handle a toddler. I didn't have a kid til I was 36 because I wasn't married until age 35.	"as far as I know my mother didn't have problems conceiving" -- This is such a cop out answer that is included in every other comment. You know most women have a lot of skeletons regarding conception because it is medical and private and sometimes painful! Miscarriages, still births, trouble with birth control, abuse, or abortions. Unless directly asked by my child, if I wanted to keep it private, I would! Most of these comments have very little information.	1
I lose my shit whenever I see "upvoted because girl" comments on Reddit. What Reddit behavior makes you irrationally angry?	Political correctness complaints in comedy subs. Sure, some humor goes too far, but when done well everything is fair game. You don't like it? Don't visit comedy subs. I feel like every time I finally find a place that shares my sense of humor there's always that one person who's only there to whine and complain about how offensive everything is.	this is specifically an /r/sex complaint, but ones where a woman makes a comment to the effect of: 'I adore my guy, but he doesn't like receiving blowjobs, and I enjoy giving them, and I never expected that and kind of miss it' happens fairly often, to be fair it probably the same one or two people responding every time but there is always, always some secondary comment response the effective of: 'You must release yourself from this relationship, you blowjob unicorn, so that you can be free to serve all the men who desire blowjobs! there are so many of us and we are all alone and blowjobless, you poor scarce resource you!' I bet I sound completely ridiculous right now but it *happens* and I hate it.	0
What’s the dumbest thing your boss or coworker has ever said to you?	5 yrs ago Co-worker(37), what is this “wow”? And you can only play it online? Hahahha that’s the most stupid thing I ever heard, that’s never gonna hold.	A coworker - "Why do you feel the need to leave at 5? I put in MY time and stay till 9 or 10 every day" She hangs out with coworkers (saying horrendous things about other coworkers) on another floor for hours at a time, shops and/or watches soccer for about 4 hours a day. Putting dual monitors to good use i guess! Me - "my contract says 9-5, my work is done in a timely fashion, and I am exempt from over time." She later reported me for the one time i left 3 minutes early to catch an earlier train because my dog was sick. I already cleared it with my boss..	0
What has an ex ruined for you?	I take the reverse question: What I (a dude) ruined for my ex? Her Master's Thesis. She cheated on, and dumped me, but forgot to download the latest copy of her MT from my laptop. She tried to recreate the several missing chapters, but could not do it without my help, and the notes left on my computer, so just gave up. last time Ive heard of her, she ended up working as a telemarketter for a bank/insurance agency. The jury is split on whether this makes me the worst person in the history of men-kind, or if it was a rightous retribution.	My backyard. After we broke up he decided to move 3000 miles across the country, to the town I moved to, and began to date my next door neighbor. I basically share a backyard with her, but he swears it's a coincidence.	0
How often do you all shower?	At least once a day, twice sometimes. I have a weird thing with showers. I find them really comforting and I feel gross if I don't shower at least once a day, even if I didn't do anything.	I shower like once a week! I have a job that doesn't require enough energy to make me sweat, and I'm naturally fit (yay metabolism) so I never exercise. I have short puxie hair that doesn't get greasy, either. So... Yeah. When it's time to shave or I get dirty, I shower.	1
Distinguished ladies of AskWomen: what kind of personal care or health habits are you now glad you developed or dropped in your twenties?	Had stopped overeating and had removed meat, dairy, and white rice, pasta, and bread from my diet. I don't go to the gym regularly, so I have to make it up in my diet. I'll occasionally have them, but only when I am going out to eat with friends, otherwise, you'll never find these things in my grocery list. Found that this had stopped a lot of bloating. and I've feel like I've been the most thinnest and confident in all of my life. Regardless, my body could be more toned and less pudgier if I start going to the gym more regularly, but I feel pretty comfortable with myself right now!	Using sunscreen even when it's not sunny out, doing cool down stretches after working out, and putting the lotion on the skin (I don't want to get the hose again).	0
Online Women Shoppers, what are a couple of the best websites to buy clothes?	I'm a big fan of Uniqlo. Their clothes are super reasonably priced, but the quality is 10x better than Forever21 or H&M	Like cheap clothes ? I usually use wish.com and then I usually order from forever 21 it’s way easier to shop online than in stores	1
Were you ever unknowingly the "other woman"??	Yup, a guy I had a strictly physical relationship with. First he was going through a complicated divorce. Then it came out that he lived in a spare bedroom in the basement. Uh huh. Found his wife's blog - she thought they were happy.	I was knowingly the other woman and fuck man... I get a lot of flack for it but people just dont understand the emotional turmoil being the other woman can be too...you fall for someone and it's always "I'm gonna break up with her" "I don't love her you are my only love" and constant heartbreak after heartbreak. I feel total guilt for the pain I probably caused but she was in another country and to me, SHE was the other woman!	1
Does anyone really only spend time with their SO?	Nope. My boyfriend and I are really independent people. We obviously enjoy being together, but maintaining separate groups of friends is extremely important to both of us. We have separate hobbies as well. Even when we go so social events, we immediately part ways to interact with others (touching base over the course of the evening). This is the type of relationship I've always preferred to have.	Aside from work (where I sit in a cubicle wearing headphones and have little interaction with my coworkers), I spend the bulk of my interaction time with my SO. Most of my friends don't live in this city, or we've grown apart, so I don't see my own friends very often. I hang out with my SO's friends (with or without him) maybe once a month, otherwise my social interaction is mainly with him. It bothers me a little because if we break up I'm probably going to become a hermit, but I was a hermit before we met and I did all right. I like it though. He's the only person I don't find it draining to be around, because we're capable of sitting in the same room, doing different things, together but not. And I like the quiet little life we've made for ourselves.	0
As a woman with a baby face, how has it impacted aspects of your life?	i just turned 33 in december and i still get pegged for a teenager sometimes. recently i got carded when trying to buy a scratch-off ticket. i've also had (much) younger guys hit on me from time to time. the worst part tho, is meeting a girl who is like MAD cute and you assume she's at least in her 20s (cus you're so used to seeing your own baby face that you subconsciously assume that other people around your age must look as young as you do too) but then you find out she's underage and you just feel gross gross gross UGH it's an actual nightmare	Sometimes people don't take me professionally and seriously at work because I look young. When I was in my 20s, I had people make offhand comments about me being too young for my job (I wasn't). I get carded still, and I sometimes think people are justing my DH because they think hes a lot older. People have also made comments that they thought my younger brother was older than me. All in all, sometimes annoying but nothing that is that major.	0
Ladies of Reddit, have you ever felt you were a “late bloomer” on something a women of your age should have down by (makeup, romance, etc)?	Um, yes? Before this year, I hadn't worn a dress (excluding when I was 4), done any makeup, worn jewelry, gone on a date (though I did have a serious relationship), done *anything* most women have done. But I'm catching up as much as I can.	I didn't have my first date until 33. I didn't learn how to do my hair until 32. I didn't learn how to do make-up, or dress in a flattering way, or any of those really girly things, until then, really. There's a correlation, I'm sure. Prior to that, I lived in books and not the real world. Sometimes I miss those times.	0
Women who have dealt with sexual abuse, how long did it take you to be comfortable being intimate again?	I am in my 30s and I am working through this. My husband is very kind, patient, selfless, and always wants to please me, so that helps. Also knowing that sex is not a dirty thing, and that in God's eyes it is a beautiful and holy thing between a man and a woman. The sensations are natural and pure, not something to be afraid or ashamed of.	im more comfortable then I was, but I'm still not completely comfortable. but then again 2020 was the first year i wasn't raped since 2014 so I guess time will tell.	0
How do people around you "get in their own way" socially without realising?	I know a guy who's really nice, but he's just so *loud*. Slams his stuff on the desks/tables, watches videos on his iPod without headphones, sighs super loudly, etc. I like talking to him, but I also get annoyed whenever he enters the room because he sounds like a stampede of elephants.	Hey, so I threw a blow-out-huge party only once for my 21st. I made the fb event weeks in advance, posted to the group like once a week w various promotional pictures, had called up a friend who lived in a PARTY HOUSE and he agreed to host, and when it came close I texted / messaged people personally to come on and get shwasted. It was fantastic! But it took a LOT of planning. I feel like I'm pretty well known but I wouldn't throw a party short notice for sure :( **EDIT: to answer your original question, I feel like I am one of those people who "get their way" and its all about speaking up. Also my friends think I'm funny**	1
I misunderstood a girl and thought she wanted to have sex with me so I did. Later I found out she wanted something else but was turned on by my spontaneity. How do you feel about spontaneous sex with a friend? What are some examples where this has happened to you?	Anyone else feel like OP is bragging? I mean, congrats OP, but I don't understand the question here. Is spontaneous sex awesome? YES	Any time I've had sex with a friend, it wasn't like *discussed* before hand. Usually there's just a vibe and someone makes a move.	0
What was something about your high school that you thought was normal but now you know it was strange?	All the kinds at my school could sing very well. The entire student body would break out in song and perfectly choreographed dance throughout the day.	There was a cow field next door and the cows occasionally got loose and wandered through campus so we had a designated "cow committee" made up of teachers and administrators to deal with them.	0
Are there any traits you think men tend to undervalue when looking for a date?	Someone you actually like and get along with early on It seems like so many dudes want a girlfriend so badly they would rather date whoever will go out with them rather than trying to date women they really enjoy spending time with. And then wonder a month later once they get to know the person, why they are incompatible. Don't try to find "a girlfriend." Don't be generic and look for someone to fill a role. Try to find a woman you want to bring into your life rather than any person who will fill the role.	A woman who is genuinely a happy person, with a positive outlook on life. I've been with too many depressing women who take everything too seriously...	1
Other than "lower your standards" what advice do you give to other women who having trouble getting dates/sex/relationships?	Don't lower your standards. Don't settle. Find that guy that will treat you like you treat him. Advice: Stay Single Fuck Society	When going on dates, try to have very little expectations. When you go in with no expectations, there's less chances you will be disappointed. Go out to meet people and have fun. Don't expect things to go this way or that way, just go with it, go with the flow and only plan to have a good time.	0
You have 30 points to allocate across 6 categories to build potential partner (max is 10 for each): looks, empathy, mental health, ambition, intelligence, charm. How do you allocate them?	That's not how it works, thankfully. How sad it would be if being good in one dimension automatically meant you couldn't be good in another.	You people are all thinking small, always min-max when creating characters. I'd max out ambition, intelligence, and charm, give myself a serious supervillain. Spouses of supervillains usually end up on nice private islands when the world ends.	0
Ladies, what's the silliest thing you do with your SO?	It's not what I do, but sometimes randomly my BF will act like he is running from me in an overdramatic way, and will go and hide. For no reason at all. But it makes me laugh every time.	My boyfriend likes to take my hands while talking to me and when I'm off guard he'll make them go through the motions of the macarena and I'm always slow to catch on. He finds it hilarious.	0
What are today's taboo subjects we really need to be talking about?	Mental illness is still largely taboo. Attempts to destigmatize it have been baby steps in the right direction. Sex work and people's inhumane views towards sex workers. How unethical the US's prison system is and the widespread apathy/schadenfreude towards the abuses prisoners face. All discussion pertaining to suicide is still too taboo to discuss, whether it's physician assisted suicide or providing some sort or suicide prevention. No one wants to touch this topic.	Racism. Even on reddit, on the liberal as hell subs I frequent (r/askwomen, r/trollx, /r/vegan, etc) I noticed that white people just never want to listen to PoC. They never want to admit they are wrong, or that behavior they've participated in is harmful, or anything.	1
What are some common "millennial problems" that you can't understand or relate to?	I don't relate to the texting pressure in the dating world for today's young people. I've never had issues with conversations via text being difficult, issues with double texting and appearing needy, dropped conversations or misconstrued emoticons. I've never sent nudes or felt like I needed to in order to keep a relationship. When I want to say something, I text. When I don't, I don't.	I'm a millennial myself and i just don't get the whole "you can't _____ if you aren't _____" trend. Like yeah let's respect culture, but to me that's just creating segregation, and discouraging us from sharing and knowing each other and appreciating the good things we've all made. I mean i do want people to feel like they are respected, but i don't know where to draw the line sometimes.	1
Have you given or received more oral sex in your life?	Received. I don't do blowjobs but my boyfriend knows if he wants sex he needs to go down on me first.	Given. I'm going to go out on a limb and say >80% of the women in this question will answer given.	0
Women who have gone to college: who was the most pretentious person you met there?	Why does it have to be a guy? One of the most pretentious people I ever met in college was a female professor who screamed at the staff in the department office for switching out the waiting room furniture.	I was running around in the rain, tossing a frisbee with some friends, when a guy walked by and grabbed our frisbee once it had dropped. I didn't know the guy personally but it was a small school, so I knew he was in a frat and on the ultimate frisbee team. Really preppy, blond, Ken-doll attractive. He's just standing there with our frisbee, examining it, so I ask if he wants to join us. He goes, "No, this frisbee isn't official weight. I don't want to damage my skills." And then he places the frisbee back on the wet ground, because even one toss of our inferior disc would have grievously de-calibrated his arm.	0
To women that always wanted to change their bodies by eating well and working out but never had the discipline ... BUT then finally did it... how did you get yourself to finally have the discipline to do it?	By being realistic! What I mean by that is I see that I have many commitments (work, family, etc) so I don't put pressure on myself to get to the gym 5 days a week. Instead I pick one day and the other days I do at home workouts because that's what makes sense with my schedule. I also don't keep junk food in the house. If I don't have it I can't eat it and then if I do go out to eat I don't feel bad putting something that isn't healthy into my body. It feels like a treat.	Sorry I'm late to the party but for me I needed to get below 32% bmi to have a chance at making 10 grand. I'm trying to do medical studies which pay a great deal. Money is always a great motivator!	1
How does your life at your current age compare to your mother's life at that age?	At 33, my mother had four boys who were approximately ages 10-15. She was a stay-at-home mom (I think) and fairly happily married to my father. She had no education after high school and would go on to have two more children (my other brother and me). She was very religious (still is) and close to her family. I'm 33, divorced, and live alone with my dog. I work writing tank manuals and am working on a master's degree. I have a boyfriend and am not religious at all.	22- she had just married her high school sweetheart, was a homeowner and working part time in a medical office. 22- living with bf/future hubby and our Australian shepherd. Just graduated college with a double BS and working as a nanny. We are still a couple years away from marriage :)	1
Have you ever experienced something that seemed small or insignificant at the time but actually ended up having a profound impact on your life?	I hate cleaning my room. I changed to cleaning room 2 times a week before I have girl friend and now my gf like to stay with me in my room. U know the rest.	I convinced my mom to take me to a fan convention for a tv show I liked when I was a teenager. Through connections I made there I got my first internship, which turned into my first job (where I had a wealth of amazing experiences), which is where I met my future husband and through my first job I got my current job at my dream company in my dream industry that as a teen I never thought I’d get a chance to work in. Who’d a thunk being a super nerdy teen would have lead me to an incredible career and an amazing SO.	0
To women who's life goals consist of all things domestic. How do you handle other women looking down on you for "not making more of yourself" and "perpetuating the female stereotype"?	I ignore them. I've been hearing the same "but you're JUST a housewife" and been told I'm "betraying feminism!" for over 25 years now. Feminism is all about having choices. Some people think that those choices are somehow invalid if they're also traditionally feminine choices. If they want to look down on me, insult, me, and dismiss me because I'm doing what I love, then they've completely lost the plot. I look at it this way: I'm not about to let any *man* dictate my life choices ... so why on Earth would I let a *woman* do it?	For me, its not a feminism thing, its a fucking laziness thing. Some people have never held a fucking job in their life, go out and work, go see what thats like and then see how insanely comfortable it is to just stay at home	1
Ladies of reddit, what were your teenage insecurities?	Acne. I swore to God I'd never let my kids go through what I did, and they both inherited my skin. I tried so hard to help them, but it was a losing battle. My mother always said, if you have oily skin, you don't end up with wrinkles. But you do get acne past middle age; not as bad, but yeah.	Hmm well....it's complicated. So I'm trans so my insecurities were...a ton. * Truly hated myself and who I was as a person and thought I had no friends because I truly sucked at life. * Joined theater to have friends and because if I couldnt be cool, I could at least pretend to be a cool person in a script * Joined sports so I wouldnt be such a bookwordy nerd and because I wanted to be stronger. I was ashamed of having such a short and small frame. (which was a blessing when I started transitioning) * And I was also hiding all of my gender related issues. I didnt want everyone to think I was homo. (And now here I am, pansexual trans woman. Surprise!)	1
Do you know guys who feel entitled to hot women - despite not doing anything to make themselves look appealing/presentable?	This is a bad idea...this is a bad idea...this is a bad idea... But yes, I do, but I also know many women like that. Women who want guys to like them for their souls while they, themselves, do absolutely nothing for their appearance. This isn't a gendered issue as much as it is a human issue. These people don't understand that most people who *try* to be attractive, somehow succeed to a certain extent. It's extremely rare for someone to be SO unattractive, that nothing in the world could ever make them attractive. On top of that, thinking you're *entitled* to anyone is a very dangerous mindset to find yourself in.	Yeah I know a ton of guys like that. They aren't as bad as you described- just basic average dudes who have no personality, no hobbies, look like every other guy out there, think that meeting basic human standard entitles them to hot girls who are freaky in bed with no sexual partners before him who meet a million other criteria as well.	0
Women who need lots of alone time - How do you ask for space without hurting peoples feelings?	I’ve found that for me, telling someone I need alone time but giving them an “end” time is helpful. Like saying “hey tonight I need some alone time but let’s talk Saturday morning. Can I call you then?” Or “I feel like I want to stay in and read tonight, but id love to hang out with you later in the week. When are you free?” If I just say I need to be alone with no resolution then that has a tendency to make people feel like they did something wrong. But if I reaffirm that I still want to talk or hang out with that person by giving them a time and letting them know that I’ll reach out or asking to make a plan makes it more clear that it’s a me thing.	I don’t. It hurts my husbands feelings. Instead I take long lunches and spend 30-40 minutes in my car after work just playing Tetris or reading my book. It’s easier than hurting him.	1
Whats the most fucked up thing you've ever done?	I was a bad kid as a young teen, like 12-14. I stole cash money out of my grandma's purse a few times. My grandma, the nicest woman I've ever known who only ever cared about taking care of everyone, and especially me, whom she cared for when my mom couldn't be a stay-at home mom anymore because money was tight, who made me spaghettio's in my favorite bowl with the handle and bought be tons of paper and pencils and crayons and markers and always encouraged me to develop my art. Who plastered her kitchen with my drawings. Honestly, I probably wouldn't draw as good as I do now if not for her. She died before I got myself straightened out. The best I can do now is aspire to be as much like her as I can.	If I even thought of wanting to cheat on my boyfriend I would be questioning why we are together in the first place. And break it off with him.	1
Redditors of AW who went to high school with someone famous, who was it and what were they like before their fame?	Don't want to give specifics on who but I went to high school in the US with a guy who became semi-famous as a pop star in Europe. In high school he was douchy and always concerned with his image. As part of his quest for fame, he got a nose job and lied about his year of birth on Wikipedia as if he were 4 years younger.	Twitch from "So You Think You Can Dance" and a bunch of other dance shows, movies, and Ellen. He was the only guy on the dance team at my HS and got so much shit for it, but he was always really sweet. He was a dance genius back then too and overshadowed all the girls. It's been exciting to see him being noticed for his talent and to see his hard work pay off.	0
Parents, what's the worst you've ever punished your children, and what did they do to prompt it? Do you regret it?	My dad threatened to put me in time out for three hours when I was little. He also put me in time out....when I was eleven. He was frustrated because he was trying to build something and I guess I was in the way. I was mortified because I thought (and still think) that eleven year olds are way too old for time outs	My son was about 4 and would not stop slamming his bedroom door. After various talkings-to, timeouts, and such didn’t convince him to stop slamming the door, he lost door privileges. I calmly told him exactly that... having a door is a privilege and he didn’t deserve one. Then I pulled the hinge pins and removed the door. He was without a door for at least 3 weeks. Honestly, it was really annoying for me and Husband during that time, as we had to be a lot quieter after his bedtime. Also, the cats would pester him during the night because he couldn’t shut them out. He’s 9 now and almost never slams doors.	0
Women who like their jobs, what do you do? How did you get to where you are today and do you have any regrets?	I own a farm that specializes in diversified livestock. We raise poultry, beef, pork and eggs that we sell locally at farmers markets. My husband left his previous employer and after kicking around for a year we decided to give it a try. It’s been a learning experience for me but no regrets.	Bartender. Decided I wanted to be a bartender, took a job at a not-yet-open chain restaurant location (because they needed so many people, their standards were low and they hired me with no bartending experience) and toughed out the shitty work environment for a year. It looks really good to have a full year at one bartending job on your resume. After a year, I took that experience to get a better bartending job at a nice restaurant, learned how to ACTUALLY bartend (not just shitty beer and premixed margaritas), and used that experience to get a laid-back job that I love. I make about the median income for my area and live well below my means, so I get to spend my money on fun things like tattoos and going out to eat. I regret not getting into bartending sooner.	0
Ladies, how do you deal with/react to catcalls, wolfwhistles etc?	It actually pumps me up a little. Granted, I don't get it that often, so when it does happen I enjoy it. I usually don't react to them though, because that would just encourage them to become more aggressive with it. I would just advise to ignore it and maybe, in some cases, take it as flattery. I was driving down the road one day and my boobs were having a very nice day, looking very hot in my camisole. This guy in a dump truck passes me, then slows down to pass me again. I looked over and he honked his horn and waved at me. I was so giddy for the rest of the day! So, like I said, in some cases it can be good for your self-esteem!	I usually just ignore it and don't even give them the time of day. According to my husband, the best thing to do is to make the most disgusted face you possibly can, like you're about to throw up. "Nothing wounds the male ego like disgust." He said to do it if you're at a stoplight and someone in the next car over is being a prick. Haven't tried it...	0
What are your thoughts on being in a relationship where you are the breadwinner and your career is the one that is the primary focus?	I like things to be a little more balanced, but if it came to it, I'd prefer being the breadwinner. I like to feel in control of my life	Fine but I would be concerned if he were earning so little that I was paying more than my share of the bills etc.	1
How often do you shower with your SO? Is it an important thing for the both of you?	At least once a week. It's nice to hold each other under the hot water. I dont soap up under the showerhead anyways, I step out into the cold half to lather and then go back.	Never, because unless you have at least two shower heads, someone is always cold. And if we did redo our bathroom to add another shower head or two, we would run through the hot water tank in about five minutes.	0
What sacrifices were you willing to make for an ex in order to make a future work, but now that they're an ex you're glad you no longer have to make those sacrifices?	My ex husband came from a very family-first culture and we made a lot of financial sacrifices paying for shit for the extended family. I dont mind doing what i have already done and no regrets, but i am glad my current boyfriend comes from a family where people pay for their own shit.	Keeping my mouth shut because anything other than immediate agreement made him angry. Okay, may be I wasn't so happy about it. But I was doing it.	1
What is your experience with altering your “standards” for a potential SO?	I always said I wouldn't date a guy that doesn't enjoy reading. Dated a guy who read 1984 and Brave New World because I spoke about them a little bit. Found out two months into the relationship he only read them to impress me and by that time I liked the rest of him. I get my book love from other people instead	I’m dating someone who may not have I️t all together financially but they never make me feel like I️ need to help them out or do anything for them. He’s fun to be around, accepting and very considerate of my feelings. But I️ worry that because he’s not some rich millionaire that people will judge me but honestly this is the healthiest relationship I️ think I’ve ever been in. What are your standards that you’re willing to overlook and which ones are your deal breakers?	1
Has a gay guy ever been sexist towards you? And how?	I worked with a guy that said many fatphobic things (like literally saying fat people are bad people) and that gay men cannot sexually harass women because they are gay. He said he could go up to a woman and grope her and it would not count as sexual harassment. I was told to accept his comments because “it’s different in the gay community.”	Yes! I went to a gay bar for my 27th birthday because it's something I've always wanted to do. Had the time of my life! Went to the bar to order a drink and a gay guy came right beside me, spoke to the bartender, and said "oh I've got her drink! She'll have a sex on a beach! Did I guess that right?!" NO! Not every girl enjoys cocktails...I just wanted a beer. To me, this was pretty sexist. He did apologize and gave me a hug, so it wasn't a big deal. But that's the only time I can think of.	1
Women who were ugly/average until college and then blossomed into beautiful/hot, what was the hardest thing to deal with after the transition?	Being so used to rejection and ridicule that you don't even try, or underestimate your "league". Thinking you don't "deserve" a decent looking, self-confident, and professionally happy guy because you're "not in his league" is a recipe for rough relationships, or none at all.	Figure out who likes me for who I am. It gets extra difficult when the guy himself misreads his own feelings and mistakes physical attraction (+ friendly interest) with romantic interest. Extra heartbreaking when he realizes it was mostly lust after I already fell in love.	0
As a police officer, in day to day interactions how could I make you more comfortable?	I work at a place with really heavy security so I spend a ton of time with cops. The ones I'm most comfortable with are the ones who are funny and friendly but remain kind of distant and professional at the same time. There's a good balance to be had. Corny jokes are always welcome. Sexism isn't.	I have a lot of faith in police and only have had positive experiences. Thanks for caring enough to ask this question though.	1
Women who have felt disrespected and/or burnt out at work due to the disrespect. How have you dealt with it?	I left the job as soon as i could. I didn't want to waste time and effort on people who don't see my value.	I put up with it for a little while, but it slowly got worse and HR refused to do anything about it. So, I quit as soon as I could.	1
Ladies of Reddit who’ve cut off your (ex) best friend, what happened and how long did it take you to get over it?	Wasn't my best friend but she was definitely very close to me. It took about 8 hours of her holding me hostage in her house, saying that I had been drugging her water, food, tapping her phone, that I was a clone and she was going to abduct my son and find the real me, for me to cut her off. It took me about a week to get over it, and now I don't miss her at all. The week that it took me to get over her was more fear of her coming and breaking into my house in the middle of the night.	She slept with my ex boyfriend when I wasn't over him and I cut both out of my life. I can say hi now and hold a small talk conversation when running into either one.	1
How many of you deal with dark inner thighs and armpits? Any tips to lighten them?	I'm trying to picture this, and I'm not imagining anything that would turn me off, especially if I were already into someone enough that our clothes were off.	I had pretty dark armpits, and 90% of it went away after I went for IPL hair removal. For me, the dark tint on my skin was coming from the hair follicles that wouldn't go away when I was waxing/ shaving Edit: Changed laser hair removal to IPL	0
If someone considers you their friend way more than you consider them your friend (i.e. unbalanced friendship) what should that person do?	I'm going through this currently, primarily with my female friends, particularly as they almost never initiate. Basically, if someone considers you a good friend of theirs, but in your mind they're just a casual acquaintance, and their actions indicate that (i.e. always hitting you up, inviting you places) what would you want them to do? Clarify the situation, back off a bit, etc.?	Find a new friend. . . . Bro, I used to genuinely believe people on reddit were more intellectual than other social media platforms.	1
Women who have become pregnant while on birth control, what is your experience?	Oh my god why did I read this thread. I'm now convinced I'm pregnant and I haven't had sex in at least three months	I got pregnant on the pill. Tri-Sprintec. Took it every day but not at the same time everyday so maybe that's where I messed up? Anyways I have the most amazing little girl I could ever ask for! Now I have the Mirena! Much better for me.	1
Women who love themselves and have high confidence, how do you do it ?	I used to hate myself and have very low self-esteem, but I have just realized that... well I am conventionally attractive, I am smart, I am successful for my age and on track to be more so, I am loved by the people who matter to me... How could I not feel good about myself when I realize there is nothing to feel bad about? Sure I still have my small hang-ups like wanting a flatter belly or whatever, but I know that it doesn't affect my ability to love and be loved...so eh?	I like to think of myself as my best friend. I'm the only one who will always be there for me. I would never say a negative thing to my friend and therefore won't say a negative thing to myself. Sometimes you have your down days, but as a few others have said, you actively say "no" to those comments.	0
What's the story of how you fell *out* of love?	Kept making me choose between her and my friends. She'd demand I go to events for her that conflicted with things I'd set up months and months in advance with my friends. Eventually I realized that this was going to be my life if she was in it, and so she had to leave.	I heard something like, before you marry a guy, imagine that guy as your son. If you wouldn't be proud of him, don't do it. I was already married unfortunately but I realized that I would not be proud.	0
Women married to the person they love most in the world...what's it like?	Having a best friend and a soul mate all in one. Waking up everyday knowing I have someone in my corner who will always want what is best for me and our son. Feeling 100% secure in our life and being happy, even though some people think our lives are boring.	It feels like having a best friend you may or may not redrum every other week abs then realizing it’s your best friend again. Fun times!	1
How have you dealt with "low key" sexual harassment in the workplace?	"Quit being weird" "That's not funny" "Don't make this awkward" said in a dead pan voice, straight faced. Make them uncomfortable. I used to work in a mostly male environment. We all got along really well, always joking and laughing. One day one of the guys crossed the line and made a comment about my breasts. I stopped laughing, looked him dead in the eye, and said "That is not okay." He immediately apologized. They may not always have that great of a reaction, but by directly confronting the situation sometimes you can shame them into proper behavior. EDIT - I only advise using this method for small, innocuous moments with people who you usually never have problems with. If someone is being very overt, or doing little shit over time, you need to document every interaction and report it when you have a nice stack of evidence.	I had one guy infer I was a slut because I mentioned having a long weekend (in an extremely casual and nonsuggestive way). This was also my first week on the job.	1
What's a weird thing you did when you were younger that makes you cringe today?	I used to write suicide notes constantly and would wear a ribbon around my wrist counting down the years until I shot myself. Still here. Wish I had just done it and stopped being weak.	When I was in middle school I dressed like a goth.... But only on Mondays. I would go all-out with the makeup etc and I tried to get my friends to participate in "gothic Mondays". I don't think anyone ever did.	0
Why are some women so reluctant towards receiving oral sex?	Now, not all people like the same things. And it turns out that WOMEN (seriously, calling them girls makes you sound like a pedo,) are people too. Some of them don't like oral. Really, you should actually talk to your partners about what they like instead of assuming they'll all like the same thing. In other words, it makes no sense to ask *us* instead of your partner.	Personally I always worried about how I looked down there, smelled, tasted etc. I know to me it's fine, but I didn't know what he would think while we're together. Also, that angle is like the worst because my stomach is right in his face. So mainly it's insecurity. But once I did it I absolutely love it now. Some women are just different and don't like it. It happens.	0
A new dating app is launched. Instead of a photo of a person, it shows you a photo of their bedroom, car, kitchen, shoes, how they have their tea/coffee, things like that... what photo would tell you the most about someone, and would you be most interested to see to choose a potential date?	I have a thing about shoes, i think it says a lot how a person holds herself, but i also cringe if the person doesnt have "nice" shoes, there was a time where people would use those hiking boots for casual, or those ugly formal shoes...nope, plain sneakers are cheap and look the best. This is as a first interaction, second would definitely be their fridge, i cant stand people who leave cooked food for strands of times (plus my mom takes the nasty food out of the sink and plates and keeps it in a bag on the fridge), what type of food people have there and drinks.	There was an MTV show kind of like this called Room Raiders! Someone toured three bedrooms and then based on what they found, they picked which of the three contestants they wanted to go on a date with.	0
What is a sexist custom / double standard that has actually changed since your childhood?	When Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer in the early 1980s, it was seen as necessary for the bride of the heir to the throne to be a virgin. When Prince William married Kate Middleton a few years ago, that wasn't even a thing - to the extent that people weren't even talking about how that isn't a thing any more.	Well, I'm a guy and it's still frowned upon for me to crossdress even if it's not for sexual kicks. But it's ok if it's the other way around.	1
Women of reddit who are in their late twenties or thirties but don't yet feel grown up, what would have to change in your life (or how you live) in order for you to begin feeling like an "adult" in how you think of yourself?	30 here! I got married at 19 before I get to finish college in a different country . Moved to a new country then had my firstborn a year later and have been stay at home mom of 3 since then. Never been able to work an actual job except for cleaning and other side gigs. I don't even care about finishing college I have been always dependent on my husband so getting a job and being financially independent is all I want in my life!	I’m 30. I have a house, a husband, and 2 children. I have come to terms with the fact I will never feel like an “adult”	0
Women who are or used to be the "I'm not like the other girls/girls are too much drama" types, what motivated that attitude and what made it change?	I didn't know a ton of other women and I didn't get along that well with the ones that I did know. So I assumed it was a women problem, not a compatibility problem with a small number of people. I went to college and met a lot of ladies who are a lot like me.	I think the most common answer would be that women who get hurt by women just want to write them off all together. I understand that. I find almost all females to be annoying, selfish, and ultimately boring. With guys, they are annoying, oblivious, and less boring to me. A female friend wouldn't hike with me, wouldn't do daring things with me and would be judging me and everyone around us. A male friend wouldn't give a shit about anything and more often than not judge me or others people less harshly than a woman. I guess I/we don't want to deal with being judged by other women.	1
Have you ever had your work ethic crushed by a workplace where it was not rewarded? How did this happen, and did you ever recover from it?	I don’t know if this counts for the intended demographic, but as a sahm that’s an EMPHATIC YES. Affirmative. I have so much sympathy for people who work under conditions in which their time, effort, talent, and ethic are unnoticed. Feeling invisible eats up your morale and motivation... the only thing that’s slowed my growing apathy train is reframing my purpose from external reward to personal development.	I’m young, so don’t have much experience in the work force. But from my own little experience, working harder does not mean you will get proper recognition and compensation for it. For me, other coworkers continued to slack, or knew I would “fix” or take care of issues. Managers didn’t really notice either way. If they did, nothing came of it.	0
Ladies who use dating sites, does it bother you when the person messaging you didn't read your profile?	Makes sense that it would be irritating, but when a guy knows full well that maybe 10% of the no doubt *many* people who he messages will respond, hopefully in a way that encourages more conversation, reading every single profile and crafting the perfect message for every single person is exhausting.	It's a signal that I'm not going to respond to them. Other things that will cause me to not respond: - Poor quality pics: eg. group shots not indicating which one they are, only extreme facial close-ups, only pics from a distance so you can't see their face, only angry face pics. - their profile isn't filled out or only includes clichés ("I hate writing about myself" "want to know something, just ask") - the message they sent is only a single line ("hey" "what's up") or is obvious copy/pasta.	0
What is a mundane thing in your life that the average dude would have NO IDEA the use of?	Tomatoes. I have been trying to watch my weight. Only thing is, before bed, I'm a snacker. I like to munch on food right before I go to sleep. It's a habit that's hard to break. So I get a couple of tomatoes. They are ridiculously low calorie. I can chomp down some tomatoes and still be under my calorie limit for the day. Thus far, I'm down over 70 pounds.	My SO was pretty baffled one day. When I stood up and put in a tampon, using an applicator. (He was doing something at the sink, while I was peeing.) Though in his defence, he'd never actually *seen* anyone use one.	0
Have you used Bumble BFF to make new friends? What was your experience?	Yes!! I actually have, and I met up with a couple of cool ladies. I made some casual friends and then I made one really good friend who I immediately clicked with. It's a little awkward at first, but I found most people were easy to talk to!	Absolutely not. Too many women who were not interesting even slightly. Every other profile mentioned their reliance on coffee and incapability of surviving without wine or netflix. Not the type of people i'm looking for. I have however had a lot of success in making girlfriends on Tinder! Way better, women there who have that they're looking for other women ticked (whether it's romantically or platonically) tend to have more edge and have been more interesting in my opinion. I've met almost all of my best girlfriends in the new city I live in on there.	1
Ladies, would you be offended as well?	No. I've worked in a male dominated field for nearly two decades now. If I got offended every time I ran into trivial sexism I never would have gotten any actual work done. Look, I'm not saying this is awesome. I'm saying I can choose to get offended and waste my time and energy on some silly thing a (possible) douche bag said, or I can let it slide of my back and let my competence speak for me. I have better things to do with my time than get upset about a silly person saying silly things.	From what I understand, unless your job is as a penis model or king, you don't have a man's job. EDIT: Did anyone else get this reference? Am I really that old?	0
Ladies who have been in the workforce for 10+ years, what are some of your career-related regrets?	I was 7 years on one place... the same folk.. tasks... no... Soul need changes... Always... for new life.. for positive emotions... even negative emotions leed to positive emotions...	Staying in a job too long because it was familiar. Job hunting is *hard* and at times there were external factors contributing to a small job market (2008 recession). But I put up with way too much shit for too long because I was used to it. Also, don't kid yourself and think that leaving will screw over your employer. They will be fine. They will make it work and you will be quickly forgotten. Don't sacrifice your own career/happiness/wellbeing because you're worried you'll inconvenience them.	0
What was your mom like growing up and how has it impacted your relationship now?	She was really stand off-ish and distant. More than one friend who has met her has remarked she may have some kind of mental health issue or illness. I just remember that she was always exasperated with basic stuff (like loading the dishwasher) and said we were "really needy" for wanting bed time hugs or kisses. She was glad when we "outgrew" that and "stopped touching her." We're not close, and have very little contact now.	My mom was always easy going and let me do whatever I want...at the time I thought it was great but now I wish she would have been more strict with me. It took me an extra year to finish high school because I skipped class so much and there were plenty of other things I did that I shouldn't have because I knew I could get away with it. I'm not blaming her whatsoever but it would have been nice if she put her foot down every once in a while. That being said I still love my mother, I talk to her everyday, I can talk to her about anything and we're really close. I couldn't ask for a better mother.	1
Ladies, what kind of moments make you look at your SO and say to yourself “Damn, this one is a keeper”?	Today was an unexpected snow day. Neither of us knew it was coming. I took the dogs out for their wake up and go. Snow is an event here and an unexpected snow means staying off the road. So I popped on some baby foot booties. He got curious why I was waking like a demented baby giraffe. I had another pair so he decides he’s gotta try them. Watching him take the dogs out to poop while wearing slimy socks under socks in my slides bc I did the first take the dogs out in the snow was so unbelievably hilarious. They pooped when he took them out. When I took them out it was maybe 45 seconds. He wasn’t even mad when he came back inside. He knew it was hilarious to watch.	We've been together for nearly 20 years. He's watched me grow and change over time. No one on the planet knows me the way he does. He's kind, supportive, and loves even when I don't feel at my best. I just sat down with him and he offered me part of his pizza. That's love.	0
What is your shameful confession that's only really shameful within your particular social group or sub-culture?	Saying anything good about capitalism is a no no among the youth these days. Also, I feel like because I'm very socially liberal that I'm lumped with these crazy extremist that want to be a victim of everything. No I don't like the idea of mass censorship because something is offensive. I think people get far too worked up over everything and ironically turn into authoritarians in order to stop all things they find hurtful.	I rarely watch or read the news. Basically I catch what's going on through Reddit and Twitter and when it's of particular interest or importance I will look into it more. I'm the lead reporter/senior editor of a newspaper...	0
What's something that you think is blatantly sexist but men disregard you when you tell them about it?	Taking something I say, disagreeing with me (!), rewording it, and presenting it as their own statement. It goes something like this: Me: The sky is blue. Dude: No, actually the sky is the color on the rainbow between green and purple. A blue tone. I work in STEM and it's so common. One of my coworkers got so frustrated one day she announced she needed a microphone called A Man Repeating Our Ideas As His Own. Thank god I have moved to a different lab with a woman Pi who is a badass in her own right and has never made me feel like this once.	Waiting for a bus. Two guys come and also wait for bus. Bus comes, they offer me to get on first. Well Yeah, I was here first, but thank you for not letting your testosterone overcome you and fling my feeble form out of the way.	1
What was your worst date ever and why?	A guy that I saw regularly on campus kept asking me out every time I saw him, until I finally agreed to go out. I don't know what he had in mind, but I assumed that since he made such a big deal about asking me out, that he would be paying for the date. We went to a fast food restaurant, which was fine, but then he didn't have any money on him. At all. Luckily my mama taught me to be prepared, but I only had $10 on me, so we shared a bowl of chili and had some ice water. Then he wanted me to go to his apartment with him. NOPE. I took the bus home.	I dated a guy for almost a year once where it was VERY rare for him to take me out on the date, he also would never pay for my half. We'd split the bills every time. I guess its not too horrible...but hey	1
Does anyone else have beliefs that you know are rooted in sexism, but it's hard to get rid of them?	I think that women are bad drivers. I really want to be convinced otherwise, but every sinle time somebody blocks a pedestrian way, drives dangerously and recklessly close to me or doesn't check their surroundings while driving, it's a chick :(	I keep finding myself grumpy and insecure over my husband not wanting sex as much as I do, because clearly blah blah men want sex more than women blah blah. I know it's just a stereotype, but it's hard to kick it because it's so incredibly pervasive in conversation, media... just everywhere.	0
Ladies in a long distance relationship, how do you do it?	Reading some of these comments, I feel silly for worrying at all about being 2.5hr away for 4 months. Keep strong people!	The only thing keeping a long dist relationship together is the desperation level of the partners. If they can't find anyone else.. they might as well "pretend" they have a SO in another country to save themselves social embarrassment	1
What misconceptions did you have about women before finding out it wasn't true?	I am an elf who doesn't have visible leg hair nor armpit hair, and thought every other girl was the same way. I also didn't understand the point of deodorant since people have told me that my old gym clothes smell like clean laundry. College was an interesting learning experience, lemme tell you.	I thought that when I grew up and became a woman, my pee would turn blue. All those commercials with the blue liquid on sanitary pads, and only grown women wearing them.	0
XPost from AskMen: Women who have lived or live with a male SO, what were some unexpected things you learned about men from living with one?	I don't feel I've learned anything about men because I don't categorize traits into gender, even if the trait I observed was from a particular gender, because I'm not sexist. I've learned a lot about patience and hard work, though. My SO comes home from a very serious and demanding job and wants to spend two hours making authentic Thai food? How awesome is that! I've learned many ways in which people are awesome from living with my SO, I guess.	That they (at least my SO) eat so much that having a 50-50 arrangement on groceries is not the best solution.	0
Do you like it when people think you are innocent?	It's always amazed me what people will assume about you simply because you're smart enough to keep your mouth shut. Edit forgot a word	I suppose so. I smoked cannabis in front of a constable in Hyde Park at a cannabis smoke-in when I was seventeen and very stupid. He scolded me, told me I had no business being there, that I was obviously a nice girl from a good family and I had better go home or he would arrest my no account boyfriend for bringing me there. All of which, I am afraid, was true. I was a goody two shoes and when I ditched school, the assistant head master held the door open for me to leave the building. That was the extreme of my life of crime.	1
Do you agree that the best relationship is one in which you are with your best friend? If so, do you also agree that the relationship doesn't begin that way?	In my opinion, it's only positive if you're in a relationship with your (best) friend, but I don't agree with the other part. I was friends with my SO for over a year before I had feelings for him and we began dating. I wouldn't say he was my best friend at the time, but definitely a really good one. We haven't been together for very long (over 7 months so far), but I do think that aside from being lovers we are still great friends and that adds a lot to our relationship.	I don't really want to be "wooed" in the way you're describing. I don't want to falsely be made to feel special, and I don't want anyone building a fantasy around or for me. I've posted about it before, but one of my favorite things about my boyfriend is the degree to which he's been upfront and forward with me from day one. Bringing up things that bugged him early in our relationship was a huge plus to me, and it's very consistent with how he is now. He definitely is my best friend, but he might not have become so if he had been focused on playing a part for me.	0
What are some of the hypocrisy men/women display in bed ?	It seems the oral issue is very widespread. Women, I hope you know there are exceptions. I (male) do not enjoy receiving oral, and giving oral is actually my favorite part of sex.	A lot of men expect women to spend a lot of time on hair removal but don't do any of their own. Also, the kind who expect oral sex to be given to them by women but always have some excuse for why they can't reciprocate or act like it's such a difficult chore that they should be getting a medal for or.	0
Alternatively, do you have a brother who fits the "neckbeard" or "forever alone" stereotype? How is your realtionship with him?	I did. It was awesome. We would chat everyday and game together and buy ridiculous amounts of junk food and have lans, and send each other funny internet links constantly. Then he lost weight, asked me to help shop for new clothes, and became ridiculously social and went travelling, met a woman who is now his wife, and moved to the US. And now I will be lucky if he initiates a conversation with me every 6 months, or responds to any of my messages. It makes me sad.	I love my brother dearly, but he is a bit if a neckbeard. Hi isn't misogynistic (he has 3 intelligent and reasonably successful sisters, so it would be a bit hard to be). He isn't really strong on social intelligence and tends to be very over opinionated and stubborn. He goes on tirades. I mostly just smile and listen, make small corrections here and there. Arguments do no good, so you need to be patient to correct the behavior. He has made some big strides in the past 4 years and I am very proud of him for that.	1
I feel like some poeple have unrealistic porn-like expectations. What are your stories on this topic?	I've both had guys that got obsessed with/fixated on making me cum as many times as possible with zero regard for whether or not I was even still enjoying it, as well as had guys call me a liar or accuse me of faking when I *do* have multiple orgasms because "only women in porn cum like that and they're probably faking, too".	Reading this has done nothing but remind me how horrible most sex education is here in the US. At best it teaches you how to avoid getting stds but doesn't really go into the dos and donts of what is actually enjoyable. At worst (usually in private religious schools) they straight up lie to you and say the only way to practice safe sex is abstinence.	1
Have you ever became distant with a close friend of the opposite sex, simply because their SO didn't want them to be close with you?	I'm a guy's best female friend, and honestly, I'd INSIST he prioritize a potential girlfriend over me if it came down to it. He insists that any girl who doesn't like his friends should take a hike, but seriously- If it's someone he could potentially spend his life with, she comes before me. SO first, your best friend second. It's how it should be, else I've become the girlfriend (which I honestly feel like some kind of surrogate sometimes).	No, if my SO didn't want me to be friends with someone and it wasn't for a valid reason, I would tell him to take a hike. If he had a valid reason, I would stop being friends with that person, not become distant.	1
Single dad, daughter wants thongs. When is age appropriate?	My daughter is only 3, but I can't imagine being OK with thongs at 12. Highly sexualized clothing of any type is not appropriate for preteens. Honestly, I'm not sure that I'd be comfortable with it until she was 18 or so. I may be a little on the strict side, though.	Maybe the most important thing to consider is why she wants a thong. -Sounds like her main reason is to fit in with friends, which might not be such a bad thing except... -another reason might be because she feels pressure to be "sexy" or dress in a certain way. In which case it might be a good idea to have a discussion about body image, what makes a girl (woman) attractive, when that kind of attention is appropriate, etc. -always the possibility that her friends have said they are comfortable, don't show under clothes, etc. Which is probably the reason most grown women wear them, and not a bad reason. tldr; motives are key.	0
When dating/getting to know people, how soon do you to like to bring up big/dealbreaker topics?	I'm a guy but I talk about this stuff immediately with women. I literally have multi-hour long phone conversations before we even meet up the first time. I like talking a lot about stuff like this though.	I tend to think the only people that would be scared off are the people I wouldn’t want to date anyway, but I haven’t scared anyone away so far. Normally I’ll start asking before or around the first date. I’m just not interested in wasting weeks of time to find out if someone is a giant racist or transphobic person.	0
What is one thing you think men oversimplify?	How long it can take to get ready. Yes, there's the common perception that women take forever to get ready, but many men don't understand why. They think makeup and hair styling is much simpler than it is. Also, feelings. Sometimes, I'll feel a million different ways about something but many men tend to view things as black or white. Even when they understand the gray of it, it still comes out simpler to them than it is to me.	Probably themselves. I've heard a lot of men claim that men really are super simple and straightforward all the time and all they think about is sex, food, and sometimes absolutely nothing. The rest is stuff he doesn't give a shit about. Except no, because if you treat a guy as though he *is* that way in a friendship or relationship, you're gonna have a bad time. Guys have layers and nuanced emotional responses to things, even if they don't think so or want to articulate them. A lot of guys will claim the super simple thing, and then talk about how it's hard being a guy because they have all these feelings they can't open up to people about like women can because guys aren't supposed to have them.	0
what specific moment made you realize you were in love?	When she hit me across the face during an argument and I walked off instead of losing my head like I would at anyone else	Honestly - I don’t think I’ve ever had that moment. I do remember when I first saw him, and this is going to sound terribly cheesy, but everything literally happened in slow motion. It was from across a room at a very busy party, but I remember locking eyes with him at some point and it was just: “oh, there you are”. It was this extremely weird feeling of familiarity and ever since then it’s never been a specific moment, it’s just been a series of waves of “ahhhh, I love this human. This is my person.” We’ve been together for 3 years and 3 months now. He still gives me butterflies. I’m going to marry him someday. For suuuuuuure.	0
What are the unwritten rules of texting?	If you end a text with a period, I will assume you are being a jerk / are pissed at me. Example: Ok that's sounds fine! Ok, that sounds fine Ok. That sounds fine.	If you send someone a text, and they don't reply, don't send them 15 more texts about their lack of reply. Maybe like one a day later if you actually *needed* a reply and it was important.	0
What are your uncommon dealbreakers in relationships?	His social media presence. If they overshare or just kind of embarrassing/cringey online in general, that's a dealbreaker to me.	If their parents are divorced. I know, I know, it isn't entirely fair, but I know enough to know that I don't have it in me to deal with the baggage that inevitably comes along with the children of even the most amicable of divorces.	1
What was the most vulnerable an SO has ever been in front of you and how did you comfort them?	He cried hard when his dog died last summer. I held him, stroked his hair, and cried with him. Then I encouraged him to have a little memorial service since I read an article once about how pet deaths can be hard because we don't deem it as societally-acceptable to grieve for them, even if they feel like family. I didn't want him to bottle it up, so we had a little vigil where he told me stories about his dog and we honored her memory.	I wonder why there are no stories about a guy being vulnerable and then a woman losing attraction in this subreddit/thread. Hmm. Could it be that women are wonderful?	1
What things confuse you the most about men?	At least for the men I know in college, a lot of the self-worth is tied up into their ability to have a girlfriend. Not GPA, career prospects, number of friends, wealth, fitness, etc. Girlfriend.	This is more a subset of men than all men, but WTF is up with PUAs? In what universe does it make sense to stereotype all women as "girls like when you do this" and treating us like we're all this monolithic separate species that dispenses sex like a vending machine, further alienate us by reducing us to numbers on a "Hot Babe" scale of 1-10, violate our boundaries through trying anything to get "kino" and ignoring our clear "NO" by calling it "Last-minute resistance" that you just need to coerce us through--and then asking OTHER MEN WHAT WOMEN LIKE?	1
Ladies who are chronically single, what do you think is the reason for that?	im triggered by your terminology but the reason i am single is because i want to be. I am dating a few men but nothing serious because ive already been married and divorced and want none of that ever again	I’ve not met someone who likes me when I like them. I’m comfortable being single and living my life. I’m not willing to lower my standards just to be in a relationship. I’ve broken up with guys in the past because I’d rather be single then in a shitty relationship or to be treated poorly.	0
Women who have used a male prostitute, why did you do it and how was it? Have you done it again since?	This is kind of an interesting question. I've never had to because if I was that desperate, well, Craigslist is free.	I hired a male tantric masseuse. We didn't actually have intercourse, but I had a very amazing, very long sexual massage. I was curious about tantric massage and after lots of emailing, he seemed very knowledgeable. If he was still available, I would absolutely hire him again. He isn't available and the others I've spoken to since do not seem to be at his skill level.	0
Women who were mean girls or bullies in their school years, how has this impacted you as an adult? What measures have you taken to grow from this?	I learned that it came from a place of anger and misunderstanding. Someone called me out for being rude, and I realized I was being an ass. I just tried changing how I held onto that anger. Learned that it was doing me more harm and think twice when I’m irked.	My current best friend says I bullied her in middle school. I remember feeling like she was excluding me from her new friendships and tightening down on our old group. We didn’t exclude her but I think I did rub in the times we hung out that she wasn’t there. I honestly don’t remember being cruel or mean other than that but she insists I was. I know sometimes I say things before I think about how they might affect someone. Like not super obviously but I think I do lots of twisted compliments? I have ADHD so sometimes I vet something mentally and then once I’m home I’m like oops maybe shouldn’t have mentioned that. Or if I feel attacked or defensive even if it’s not done on purpose my gut instinct is to bring the other person down too. That ones been hard to work on.	1
Was there a time when you had a feeling, thought you were crazy, and turned out to be right?	I have had this feeling that the new boyfriend a friend just introduced to me is going to cheat on her 3 times now. (3 different friends, 3 different men / occasions.) And I have always been right. It's weird. And I never know what to do when I have that gut feeling.	Once I felt like a man had followed me onto the subway. I tried to brush away the feelings, sure I was just acting paranoid. When we pulled up to a station a couple stops ahead of mine I pretended to get off just as we pulled up to it. He followed me to the door, so I hopped off the train for a split second and then jumped back on after he had exited. I saw him staring at me as the train pulled away. There's a chance it was nothing, but the look on his face after the door closed was seriously unnerving. I think I might have avoided something very bad that day.	0
Non-North Americans /r/askwomen what NA specific questions are you sick of seeing/answering on reddit or elsewhere online?	I know it's a shitstorm and people are naturally worried, but anything Trump related. He might be a piece of shit, but that's the thing with democracy! Even pieces of shit can be Presidents. Here in South America we've had loads of shitty presidents, and we're still alive! Life goes on, even under terrible governments.	The ones where Europe is assumed to be one homogenous place. "*What are European men like?*" Uhm... diverse? --- "*It's because of big pharma!!!*" Except it is like that all over the world, where things are run differently than in the US.	0
Got any suggestions for meals or snacks that are very healthy and very delicious?	Tzatziki and pita bread. - Drain plain yogurt (my favorite is Stonyfield) for a few hours, or use Greek yogurt. - Put the yogurt in a bowel when done straining. - Grade up an entire cucumber. Put all the cucumber in the yogurt. - Mix in some olive oil. - If you have any, put in some fresh mint. Enjoy!	My favorite: Take your favorite yogurt (some really good stuff..for me it's usually greek) and make an icing bag to dispense little pieces of yogurt on wax paper. Freeze them. The next day I have yogurt bites. Yum.	0
[NSFW] What Changes would you make for the Vagina 2.0?	I got feeling that with all these "activated of non-consensual penetration" mechanisms my precious little guy could get into serious trouble in really innocent situations: What if it's getting frisky with your gf and you fumble around and you just stick it in for shits and giggles but she actually wasn't prepared for that and you end up with a liquefied/mangled dick :(	1. Built in contraceptive controlled at will 2. Easily & consistent clitoral and vaginal orgasms for all! 3. Periods are kinda like taking a shit. You get warning, you go to the bathroom and dump that sucka, you go about your day. 4. Vaginas smell like candy. Or vanilla 5. Secretes a poison that melts objects in instances of non-consent 6. Pest resistant - no yeasties, no BV, no STIs If we're including all repro areas: 4. Childbirth is waaaay safer and the vagina is all like "Shoot this kid out? NO PROBLEM YO" 5. No endo, no PCOS, no ectopic pregnancies, no vaginismus	0
What monthly subscription boxes do you use or highly recommend?	I really like Dollar Shave Club. If you want a really nice razor it's probably not the way to go, but I like being able to get razor blades for $6 every two months straight to my doorstep. And the blades are better than anything I could ever find at a grocery/drug store without buying really expensive ones.	Man, the disappointment when you come in a thread hoping to find a cool box to buy your girlfriend (she doesn't wear make-up ever) or shaving boxes (she doesn't have body hair / waxes once a month).	1
Ladies, what is the most unexpected thing that made you feel good about yourself recently?	I call my boyfriend "my handsome buck" (He's a hunter) and today, for the first time ever, he called me "my beautiful doe"	Today someone told me that I am very open/honest about things and that I articulate myself really well. This is something that I’ve been working on for years.	0
What's the worst gift an SO got you that you pretended to love?	He got me Wendy's for Valentine's dinner. Actually, now that I think about it, he didn't actually buy it for me, he just* drove us there.	A super tacky Coach coach ring...one with all the Cs on it in a thick band. They had so many cute things that year...I also got one of his mother's old Burberry head bands. I hate Burberry and detest headbands.	1
Ladies, What is the grossest thing you've ever done for your SO?	Cleaned up his puke (which there was a LOT of) when he got sick from drinking too much one night during a Vegas trip.	OK. So, this is really awful. Back when we first started dating, we spent the night at a friend's house and picked up crabs from the blankets they'd let us borrow. We both used the treatments to get rid of them. It worked pretty quickly for me, but my SO is pretty hairy and the little buggers just didn't want to vacate the premises. They were everywhere...even on his legs and under his arms! I spent hours with tweezers plucking the little bastards off of him and killing them. It was quite the bonding experience although it's also one of those things about which we no longer speak.	0
Are there any other women who think the "strangers should never talk to me" thought process is a bit extreme?	I personally don't have a problem with being approached in public as long as they back off if/when asked, but I also think it's perfectly understandable to not want to be approached whilst going about your daily activities. At a bar or club or even a gig or at the cinema is different because it's a social activity but I can't say I've ever enjoyed an interaction that started from being approached in the street or a shop or the like.	I think it's worse than extreme ... it's downright anti-social. If someone is polite and tries to strike up conversation, what's the big deal? If the person approached doesn't want to converse, they have the option to politely say so. I say no harm, no foul.	1
What Is Something That You Could Not Understand, Or Relate To Until It Happened To You?	How constricting anxiety and depression can be. And how they can turn you into a hollow shell of yourself that doesn't leave bed.	Literally everything. Being a parent, breaking a bone, jumping out of a plane... You can't really understand anything until it happens to you. So its kinda bothersome to me that people think that any one experience is, by nature, more transformative than any other Being nitpicky aside, I'd say getting my master's. Feelsgoodman. jpg	1
Mothers, what is the most embarrassing thing your child has ever done?	Well, last week my son announced to the people at the park that we were growing "lots of penises" in our garden. Carrots. We harvested carrots.	I’m not sure if this is what u mean but it sure was embarrassing when my 19 year old scrolled the wrong way on my pics and seen my naughty pics lmao	1
What was the most unreasonable reason your parents were mad at you?	I had washed all the dishes as part of my chores before going to stay with a friend for the weekend. When I came back home (literally when I walked in the door), my mom started yelling at me because the dishes weren't clean...the dishes they had used while I was gone and I would have had no opportunity to clean as *I wasn't home*. When I pointed that out to her, both of my parents yelled at me and grounded me for talking back.	Fair enough. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset anyone. Where I'm from people wouldn't really see that as a gendered insult and I didn't appreciate that others might see it differently.	1
What is your most problem part of your body when it comes to fitting into clothes?	I’m too small for western sized clothes. Sometimes XS is too big… Edit: I live in Sweden. Shoes and clothes my size are considered children-sized. My clothing style (modern goth) only have sizes for “somewhat obese” people in the stores here and it’s so frustrating!	Most skinny jeans are too tight for my calves. If I buy a bigger size then it’s too big for my waist and thighs. I’m pretty short so wearing flared jeans make me feel even shorter so prefer skinny jeans.	0
What is something your SO once told you and it still pisses you off even thinking about it ?	My SO told me that he would have no problem breaking up with me if he met a girl who he thought would be better for him. I understand what he was trying to say, like he would break up with me before ever cheating on me but the way he said it really stuck with me. It made me insecure and jealous of whatever other girl he was interacting with. He's very particular about who he likes and even girls I know he'd never go for, I still felt that terrible feeling. He's no longer my SO. For that and a list of other reasons why I broke up with him.	"i will never love anyone more than i love my mom" he called and tried to take it back a few days later but the damage was already done.	1
What kind of salary / year would you consider middle class? Upper middle class? Very well off?	I live in Argentina, so a salary of about $1200-$1500 for a family of 3 or 4 is middle-class. My SO earns a bit less than $1000, and I earn the rest, and we'd do perfectly fine except for my medical bills. $1500-$3500 is upper-middle class. More than $3500 or $4000 is "holy fuck you must be a politician why are you making so much money". Edit: these figures are per month, we don't calculate salaries per year.	I tend to think of it less in numbers and more in "how many paychecks are you from being unable to pay for your basic shelter, food, clothing, utilities, and needs?". In my very rough estimate: * Missing even one 2-week paycheck could leave you without basic needs or even homeless? Poverty to Working Poor * Missing 2 to 3 paychecks will leave you with no options and no savings? Working Poor to Lower Middle Class * Missing 4 to 6 paychecks will leave you with nothing? Lower Middle Class * Missing 7 to 12 paychecks will leave you with nothing? Middle Class * Missing 13 to 16 paychecks will leave you with nothing? Upper Middle Class * Able to survive an entire year from savings without any difficulty? Well off. * Able to survive for multiple years from savings without any difficulty? Rich.	1
How much did the amount of attention you get change after you got breast implants or butt implants? Positives/negatives?	Ten years ago, I went from an A/B cup to a DD/E cup [I asked the doc for a C cup]. I LOVE them. I got quite a lot more attention, 99.5% positive, after I got them. The only negatives for me are so minor that they're really nothing, especially compared to the benefits.	Not to knock women who get implants, but I love my natural B/C cups. I thought about going bigger because they really don't look like much, especially braless. But I've heard and read a lot that big breasted women don't get taken as seriously which can make it difficult in the professional world. Since that is where I'm heading, I chose my career over boobs. Maybe kids will increase them a bit, maybe not. But either way, I plan on keeping things natural for as long as possible with maybe a lift in the distant future. Edit: breastfed to breasted.	1
Have you seen the "modesty and miners" post on Facebook recently? What are your thoughts on it?	Those ladies need to contact HR for sexual harassment. To avoid a lawsuit, the chairman should have just said, "Professional dress code applies here. Please change your outfit to something more fitting a business meeting." Also, you know what I love about this tract? I love the way it suggests that diamonds, gold, and pearls were given value "by God" rather than by men and women who like pretty sparkly things.	I think we have to be *soooo* careful how we teach and frame the modesty issue when talking to young girls (boys too). If we're not careful, it can be very harmful to their self-esteem. Stuff like this makes me cringe so hard. And I'm all about modesty! But it's by nature a very sensitive issue, and needs to needs to be treated with a great deal of care.	1
Your date doesn't leave a tip, what do you do?	I'd probably bring it up; there might be some context i an missing. Maybe he miscalculated, maybe he isn't aware of tipping customs, maybe the wait staff was rude when I didn't see, maybe that's all be had on him and he was too embarrassed to say... If it was purposeful but unwarranted in my mind, I would leave it myself if he had paid for both of us. I am not sure I would if we had gone dutch. Either way, I would hesitate before going on a second date.	Tipping is not required. Idk, I'm from California and the servers here make minimum wage. I find it ridiculous that people get butthurt if you don't tip. As mentioned below tipping began to help supplement those UNDER the minimum wage line. It was also done to build rapport if you wanted to become a "regular". I know plenty of other people who have shitty minimum wage jobs that DO NOT get tipped. Nobody bats an eyelash. Waiters are not special. Their job is not insanely difficult. A tip is awesome but Dont look down on others just because they didn't feel the need to hand out extra money to people with normal minimum wage jobs.	1
What's something that you listen to your SO talk about but don't really care?	Seriously, all you ladies out there that listen to your SO's IT/tech ramblings, y'all are the BEST. I work as a Linux Administrator and being able to explain something to her to help me understand helps so much. She's so patient with me and I always return the favor by listening her talk about makup!	He's a bartender. I don't drink. Sometimes he talks about certain beers or wines, and I just cannot for the life of me relate to his interest. But I like to see him happy about things, so I listen and try to understand.	0
What do you think of open relationships?	Some people enter them too readily, without proper communication and planning, maybe as a desperate attempt to save a relationship. These will not work. Some people will refuse to be in anything else and hate on monogamous people or bang on about what's natural and what isn't. These people are not nice people. Some people simply prefer a life of polygamy or polyandry, are open and honest about this, and will form many successful and long lasting relationships. These are the people who will succeed. Personally I don't think it's for me. I think I would simply get too jelous and insecure, and I enjoy the exclusivity that being with one person brings. And that's okay too.	I had a few when in college and it was awesome. I stopped because I didn't think you could raise kids like that so married someone very vanilla now wish it was open. Just decide what works best for you	1
Last night I dreamed I had a beautiful owl cat (cat with the huge majestic wings of an owl). What's the coolest thing you've ever dreamed about?	I had a dream that I was squatting at a gym and Terry Crews came up to me and told me I had perfect squat form. He then worked out with me till I woke up. Best dream ever 😍 my bf was jealous haha not that I was working out with Terry Crews but because he wasn't lol *but seriously if any one can just hook me up with a gym session with Terry Crews that would be great*	Keeping with the cat theme, I had a dream that my cat could text me. We need cat owls and we need texting cats - stat!	1
Women who own their own businesses, what is it and how did you get started?	I am an illustrator and I sell prints of my work on etsy and go to comic expo's as an exhibiting artist. I'm still a student so it's not exactly a full plunge yet but I'm working on it!	Some could argue it's not a real "business" but I own and run a small English language school in a non-English speaking country. I teach there along with my only employee whom I stole from the first place we used to work together at. I started by being invited to a private school and gaining some real world experience after university. Then I went self employed and tutored in a small office in the center of the city. Not I rent a separate building and plan to build my own school =) I love it.	0
How will the ban on Muslim countries affect you?	I'm Muslim, but I'm an American citizen and not from any of the countries that are banned. I went to the masjid last night and there was a lot of anxiety. I don't know. I just hope this is where it ends.	I'm Muslim. Much of my family lives in Afghanistan and Pakistan. At the moment I think Pakistan is not on the list but I have no doubt it will be soon. How will it affect me? I'm going to buy a gun as soon as I can. I'm not going to tell anyone I'm Muslim but I'm going to fight for voter awareness so that 2018 is the year we stop trump. I'm never going to forget how it feels when your own country tells you you're violent and inferior.	1
How long had you and your SO been together before you said "I love you"?	3 months. He said it first. On my birthday. We were drunk. I said it back. Then the next morning when we were sober he said it again.	I totally worked it out of him. I had been feeling that way for a while. We had been together for 4 or so months at that point. We spent the night just talking and being cute and then when we went to bed I told him, "I can't believe how much I've fallen for you." And then he said "I love you" and then I said it back. Anyway, getting married in September.	1
What's a common opinion you see across reddit, but don't hear often in real life?	That dating and sex are rare and difficult to attain. Everyone I know who is trying to date is successful.	Forearms. I have never heard a woman outside of Reddit talk about a man's forearms, let alone consider them sexy. Surprised me.	0
Girls, what makes you happy you're not a guy?	Dealing with random boners in high school would have given me a nervous breakdown. I also really enjoy dresses and wearing fun eye shadow colour palettes. I am also very glad that I rarely have to stifle my emotions because of society's expectations. I enjoy having a good cry when a good cry is due. I find it very soothing and uplifting.	I wouldn't say I'd rather be a guy physically, but socially I think men have all the advantages. Except for being seen as more dangerous around kids and stuff. That's a drawback. But still, they automatically get people assuming they are strong and able to protect themselves and others.	1
What seemingly inconsequential thing did someone say or do to you that really messed you up in some way?	when i was about six years old a girl in my gymnastics class told me i was the ugliest girl in the class. i didnt realize it until years later, but that was the start of my insecurities. also, a few years ago my best friend made a comment about how i run, and now i try to avoid running in front of people because of it.	Mine is sort of a recurring one, but my older sister is legally blind, and every time I try to talk to my mom about any kind of problem in my life, she says "Just think how much harder life is for your sister!" It's made me feel guilty about feeling upset about my problems, and it's also really made me resent my sister, which isn't fair to her because she would never say anything like that. My mom always says that she's just trying to give me some perspective and that it shouldn't bother me so much, but it feels like nothing going on in my life is significant enough to matter to her.	0
What are some funny/cringy things you've had said to you by a customer at your job?	A couple years ago, I worked at Chick-Fil-A. One day, this lady pulled up in the drive-thru and before I could even get out the usual "hi how are you" she asks me "do you hate gay people?" Apparently she thought that since the founder of CFA was against gay marriage, everyone who worked there must hate gay people. Even after explaining that's not true, she proceeded to say she just can't support a company like that but then gives me her card to pay for her food. It was weird.	Older guys keep hiring on me. One of the common ways is asking me over to cook. My answer is to just laugh and tell them if they want a date with me, they're the ones that need to cook me dinner. Gets a chuckle every time. But, really, my boyfriend does most of the cooking. I'm a modern woman.	1
Have you ever noticed someone try and sneakily take a picture of you?	I know a woman that this happened to on the city bus. She confronted the guy when she heard the shutter, it escalated, then he got off at the same stop as her... Thats when he apologized and claimed to have deleted the pic. Thats when she slapped the phone out of his hand, smashed the phone into bits under her heel, all while yelling "fk you, you dont take pics of me without my permission." All the people around applauded.	Yup. In high school there was a bunch of guys who were always clustered around my locker so I had to step over them to reach it since apparently they're superglued to the floor for exactly 1 hour once they sit down. One of them pointed his phone under my long jacket to take a picture of my ass and started passing it around to his friends while I was still there. He asked me out later that year and was genuinely surprised when I said no.	0
Mothers that have achieved this, how have you been able to keep or get back your own individual identity separate to being 'mum'?	Being mum IS part of my identity. I love my children, will not deny them to celebratey my “own individual identity“ and have not lost any part of me worth keeping I think. I am now more caring, altruistic and happier than ever so I do not miss the old me. “Mum“ is not something bad and having children transforms you (most hopefully) to something even better. Copy with your new identity and stop mourning you are not a child anymore yourself.	I regained my identity when I went back to work. For the first few months everyone still focused on the baby and asked the usual “mom” questions, but over time I just did my job and for 8 hours a day it was like nothing changed. I also make sure I schedule hang out time with my friends who don’t have kids. I love my friends with kids but when we get together we tend to only talk about our kids and our shared gripes. There’s nothing wrong with that and I think it’s important to share our experiences but when I meet up with my kid-free friends we talk about a variety of things (concerts, books, politics, movies) that make me remember that I’m my own person with interests and experiences that are separate from my daughter.	0
What stereotype about your group do you wish didn't exist?	The Hair Length Theorem: 1. The longer a girl's hair is to her waist, the dumber she is. 2. The shorter a girl's hair is to her scalp, the more of a lesbian, feminazi ball-buster she is.	I'm a geek (socially awkward) and nerd (like nerdy things). Like hardcore "I play Starcraft in my freetime and I'm majoring in computer science and engineering" nerd/geek. I don't really hate women. I *hate* with a passion 'gamergate' (A WOMAN DID SOMETHING WE MUST RALLY AGAINST HER) and I'm not a brocialist (I'm actually a far far person). I understand *why* the stereotypes exist. And if someone doesn't like me because of those stereotypes I kind of get it because...most 'gamers' are like that.	1
Ladies, do you have stories where a fellow woman helped you out when you needed help?	I was having a mini breakdown a week before midterms during my first semester of university. I was in a rarely used corner of the library having a nasty stress cry. This random older lady pulled up a chair, handed me a pack of tissues, and patted me on the back until I was done. She said she was one of the psychology professors, and she made her rounds through the quiet sections of the school around midterms and finals looking for the students that needed her. She offered a hug, a prayer, a baggie with Hershey kisses and a granola bar, and some advice for general stres relief. I later left due to financial reasons, but I never forgot how awesome she was for doing that.	I was in court for a fix it ticket in burbank with my toddler and did not have the proof showing the taillight had been fixed. The judge asked told me I could pay $20 dollars to the court and one of the court police officers would sign the paper for proof. I had no money on me so as the judge is telling me I had to go downtown to high patrol office where it's free when this kind women handed me $20 and said because I had a small child with me she wanted to make it easier for me.	1
Jumping off the post in /AskMen... what are the signs a guy might be too high maintenence for you to consider dating?	Expecting me to essentially be his mother, expecting me to make all the plans. Things like that. Put your fair share of effort in, dude!	A guy I was dating bought powder foundation to make himself look perfect. (He didn't even have bad skin, he just wanted to look "flawless" like newscasters, celebs, etc) DEALBREAKER. I still giggle when I think about that.	1
Ladies in the military, what should I know (what did you wish you knew) before signing up?	While everyone here has given great advice as what it is like when you're in, know that the joining process is important, too. I'm leaving for Air Force basic training at the end of this month. It took me over a year to enlist, the other branches are much quicker. The recruiter may not openly lie to you, but mine tried to bully me into going open contract. I stood firm and landed a job that I really wanted. Go in knowing that the recruiters are there to make numbers, not to look out for your best interest. Some of them are actually good people but it's not worth the risk. Do your research. Google your questions. Gather your knowledge and make an educated decision.	You should know exactly WHO you're fighting for and exactly WHAT you're fighting for. Basically the elites violent and insatiable lust for natural resources. Many innocent people are being murdered every day to satisfy this evil greed. As long as you know this reality.	1
Do you have a disappointing engagement story? How did it turn out?	Your engagement is not terribly important. Your wedding is not terribly important. What is important is your marriage, and your partner. And the biggest part of a successful partnership is good communication. If you're so concerned with having a big fancy surprise engagement with the "right" ring, then communicate what it is you want. If you expect him to read your mind, prepare to be disappointed.	My ex proposed to me on my 21st birthday in a cab (he proposed many times but this one is the time with a ring). He gave me a ring that he later gave to someone else while we were on a break. We got back together, then when we broke up (again), I saw it on a different girl that I considered a friend. He later tried giving it back to me when he ditched her and ran back home. That ring was kind of like the sisterhood of the traveling pants, except none of us had a nice time and we all hated each other. Ah, young love.	0
What's your "WTF, I thought stuff like this only happened in movies" moment?	Tbh, I don't talk about those moments because I get called a liar. Truth is just stranger than fiction more often than one would think.	In a 15 mile stretch of freeway, in the middle of the night, I blew 2 tires and my fuel pump completely went out, stranding me on I-15 somewhere in Wyoming. (This did not all happen at once...first one tire, a few miles later the other tire, and then the fuel pump. On a 3 year old car with just 40,000 miles) Edit: Also, forgot to add, after the first blown tire, a small group of bikers pulled up and stayed with me until my roadside assistance showed up (even though it took over an hour), because they said it wasn't safe for me all alone. Nicest group of people I've ever come across.	0
Women of Reddit, what was something your SO did that made you want to kiss them immediately after they did it?	Every night before bed my fiancé says "Kisses?" It is super cute, and he always gets what he asks for. :)	I'm currently going through a rather nasty throat infection. Even though he's working this weekend, my boyfriend brought me breakfast in bed and while I went to wash up, he lined up all my morning meds and a glass of water so I don't have to go rummaging for them. It's little thoughtful things he does that make me melt. <3	0
How do you prevent losing yourself in a relationship?	Have your man put a GPS tracker on your phone. Then whenever you get lost, ask him to help you.	Those are two different questions, I’ll answer the question in the title. Don’t go into a relationship looking to be “completed” by somebody. It’s important to know and be sure of who you are first and your partner accepts that person instead of having somebody try to mold you into what they want you to be and in turn losing who you really are. Great question!	0
How do you feel about Tennessee's new law that will criminalize women depending on their pregnancy outcomes?	I think this is a symptom of the American Justice system trying to codify everything. We seem to treat making a law for something as the best solution, which is definitely not the case. It's the easiest to enforce, but ignores the larger societal problems that can only really be tackled with long-term change through education and reform.	My nephew was born 6 weeks early addicted to heroin and pain pills. She never faced jail time. He was taken away and given to her parents by the state. He was then given right back to her. My cousin finally got custody when he was 3. He couldn't walk and could not say more than one or two words. He had sores from being in a dirty diaper for so long that he spent three days in the hospital. If a mother uses illegal drugs while pregnant, I think they deserve years in prison. Anyone defending these people have probably never experienced what this shit is really like.	1
What is your favorite unusual name?	My husband has been insisting that our first daughter be named after his grandmother Lillian. I convinced him that name was too old fashioned, so we compromised on Lilly Anne. In exhange, I got to choose girl name number 2 and boy name number 1. My favorite boy name do far is Hunter Blake. The girl name is Willow, but I'm stumped on a middle name that goes with it.	You mean names from my future baby name bank? Because I have one of those haha. I like antiquated names, like Vera, Penny, Maisie, Moira. I knew a girl from Fiji who's name was "Simi," and I've always really liked her name.	0
What are your thoughts on Lolita?	Nabokov is a brilliant fucking writer, and I love *Lolita*, despite how hard and unsettling some of it can be to read. He's one of my favorite Russian authors.	It is my life's ambition to re-imagine it as a zombie survival story. I think it fits the genre quite nicely. EDIT: WELL THEN. WAY TO SPIT ON MY AWESOME DREAMS.	1
What is something your SO has done, that you've forgiven them for, but affected your self esteem?	Ex SO for me but we had decided to have a baby during Xmas. I was all ready for the sex etc. What did he do, he rejected my every attempt for a month. He said he needed time to think it through even though we had already made the decision. Mind I say he was the one who said to me "let's make one of these for ourselves" while holding his sister's baby girl on Xmas. I'll never forget the feeling when I had dolled up in sexy lingerie etc. And he rejected me walking out of the living room. I got so miserable I through the sexy lingerie into the trash and did no attempt anymore. We did finally get pregnant after several months.	He bought me a dermaroller for our first Christmas together because he didn't like the acne scars on my cheek. Although it made me feel self conscious about my face, I forgave him. He's an extremely kindhearted person; just oblivious at times.	0
What is something your SO has done that absolutely broke your heart?	We've been together since 2002. He knows my birthday means a lot to me. I don't ask for extravagant things or dinner at some 5 star restaurant. This year he, and our children (who are younger than 12) didn't do anything. I thought they were pulling my leg. Nope. I didn't even get a card. If I hadn't said it was my birthday they wouldn't have even wished me a happy birthday. He took me out for breakfast because we hadn't eaten, so it was just another day. It sounds stupid. But it hurt more than anything over the last 14 years with him.	I expect the one person I've given it completely to to treat my heart with enough care that it'd never be "absolutely broken".	1
My dog is a panty snatcher. What weird things do your pets do?	My sister's cat used to steal pens from around the house and hide them under the bed. We didn't figure it out for like a year when we moved her bed for some reason and there was a pile of at least two dozen pens sitting under it. We knew she liked to chew on them, had no idea she was stealing them.	Poops on construction signs and stop signs. Basically if its a street sign, he'll lift his leg up like he's about to pee, but poop on it. He's really anti authority I guess.	0
To women who have close male friends, have they ever made comments about women (appearances, certain traits, etc.) that has made you uncomfortable? If so, how did you deal with it?	Occasionally someone will make a generalisation that I personally don't agree with, and I feel horribly out of place when they say oh I'm different. It's like they're trying to put the "not like other girls" label on me. I remember for example a friend of mine who was going to propose to his girlfriend. And he was like, "Well I got to spend X on a diamond" and I was like, "Have you actually asked what she wants?" And he dismissed that saying it would ruin the surprise and all women wanted a diamond ring. There's me with my unconventional non diamond ring which I reminded him of and he's like "nah you're different". In the end his fiance wanted an emerald!	Yeah. If they're really close friends and I think they'd be receptive, I may let them know that what they said made me uncomfortable for some reason, just so they know. But I also know that not everyone is going to take hearing that well, and so I will sometimes just keep my mouth shut and deal with it internally. Yeah, we're all part of a patriarchal system.....	1
If you could submit ONE support ticket to your body, what would it say?	Dear Body Support Staff, I am experiencing an issue in which my body seems to think eating a box of Nerds is an acceptable replacement for dinner. Do you have any idea what is causing this bug or how I can fix it? Thank you for your time, /u/fishielicious	Dear Bodies R Us Customer Support, I recently purchased 1x Female Body from your store. Unfortunately, what has arrived is your other product, "Male Body". As a woman, this body is clearly not fit for purpose. Could you please send me the correct model, I would be happy to return the one you sent me provided you reimburse me for any reasonable costs incurred doing so. Kind regards, /u/cuddlegoop	1
What is the cruelest thing you've ever done?	I was fighting with my dad and told him that I wish he died instead of my mom. I still feel terribly about that and it's been over 10 years.	I slept with a married man multiple times over the span of two months. I know his wife. She is a friend of a friend and we have all been invited to the same dinner parties. I once had sex with her husband in the bathroom while dessert was being served.	1
What fashion trend makes you cringe or laugh every time you see it?	Man bun. The droopy pants thing. That shit was never cool, and now it's beyond played out. You really got to have a certain look to get away with anything leopard print. Stretch pants can be too good or too bad. Be aware of what your ass looks like or else wear a long shirt with that get-up. Skinny jeans. Just stop. Oversized sunglasses with gold plating and monogram shit down the sides. Enormous fuckin' hoop earrings.	Camis/tanks layered over shirts. All I can think of is my awkward middle school days when that was the only way you could wear a tank because of the dress code.	0
What are some outdated customs that don’t make sense anymore, but people still follow them simply out of tradition?	Eating meat. Except for people with rare health conditions, you can be completely healthy without eating meat, and it is particularly easy in developed countries where so many foods are available. The environmental destruction caused by meat and animal production causes is beyond belief. But everyone still eats it because that's what they have always done.	this may be just where I live, but most people here are lukewarm Catholics who only baptize their kids out of tradition and so that they will be able to attend Catholic schools which are known to be stricter and more homogenous.	0
Sex lingo: what terms don't you know? What are you surprised that other people don't know? How did you learn these terms?	I feel like I learnt a couple of new ones doing a sly google during cards against humanity but I can’t recall now.	I lived with an ex-boyfriend and a his best friend for a while. One weekend, I was talking to the best friend, told him that boyfriend and I were going to the glory hole tomorrow, and invited him along. Confusion and hilarity ensued when we discovered that I had never heard of the sex act "glory hole" and he had never heard of the waterfall in rural Arkansas named "the glory hole". It's a real and awesome waterfall. You should look it up!	0
(Inspired by AskMen) Non-American women who frequent here, what are some differences you notice here compared to women of your home country?	**Dating:** A big one for dating culture is that cold approaches seem to be really rare here outside of pubs/bars/nightclubs. People talk about being hit on in the supermarket and I'm like WTF who does that??! **Periods:** Applicator tampons are not that common here. We do have them and I know girls who use them but they're definitely not standard. Pretty much all public bathrooms (and private businesses) in NZ have special bins for tampons/pads. Not some weird ass little brown paper bag but like a proper tall closed lid bin with this special fluid inside. In the better places the bin lid is motion activated.	Eh, mostly online general but the america-centric BS is annoying. It does happen here, especially with women thinking an issue American women face = world wide womens issue. It gets really annoying because America does have a lot of issues like when it comes to transgender rights, non-whites, gay rights and even womens rights and they love spouting on about it like its an issue around the entire world. They look at American life and American problems and apply it to everyone else. I'm not saying America is awful and every other country is perfect, it's not, we all have our own problems, but America =/=world. American centrism gets REALLY fucking annoying.	1
What’s your pre-bed ritual like? How do you “switch off” before bed?	I fall in bed exhausted still wearing clothes and fall asleep telling myself I am just laying down for a second. I wake up at three am needing to pee, bush my teeth, and take off my pants. Then go back to sleep. My routine could be better.	Step 1. Marry a spouse that is actually a child disguised as an adult male. (I suspect many men may be this.) Step 2. Get a full time job. Step 3. Have a child By the time my child’s bedtime comes around it is all I can do to get in her bed and put her to sleep. I fell asleep with her so often that I have learned to put PJ’s on before I put her down.	1
Older Women of Reddit, what do you think is BETTER about today’s youth?	I honestly really like the current youth. You're as politically focused as the boomers were but without the selfishness. You have a lot of the cynicism of us Gen-x without the abject acceptance we suffered. And you have the same drive to deliver a better world we did. IMO a good balance of the two. Yes, there are a lot of the traits that mark every generation of youth - a bit too naive, a bit too simplistic, a bit too easily drawn to extremes - but with the starting point being as good as it is I think you guys will do OK. I just hope you guys understand your power and exercise it before it is too late.	I was interested in people's answers. But I'm seeing a lot of "I'm not older but" Hard to find nice things to say about younger people when they can't shut the fuck up and let the people the question was directed at answer.	1
Women who have never struggled with weight, how do you eat?	I've never really over eat. I don't like soda and I make pretty good choices when I do snack and eat. There is a difference when I don't though. I'll be bloated and my skin looks bad. I don't believe if I ate whatever I would stay thin. I think another thing is that I do not eat fast food regularly. Maybe once a month if that and it's either Chipotle or Burgerville which I don't think is too bad compared to what else is out there.	I think some of it is genetics. Other than that: Ever since I was a kid I disliked sauces on things. So no salad dressings, no condiments on burgers, etc. i also don't drink pop cuz I dislike the sugar rush. I like mustard, but I don't think that has many calories. Also, I think I must be allergic/intollerent to something cuz fairly often food just goes right through me. Maybe I don't absorb as many calories at those times. Lastly, I definitely eat less than others. I think much of it has to do with me being unable to tell the difference between stress pain and hunger pain. So sometimes when I'm hungry I just assume I'm actually just stressed and just ignore it. So sometimes I forget to eat for a while. Edited to add: I'm not an active person. Just for comparison's sake.	1
What friend or schoolmate from your childhood turned out exactly the way you thought & who did a complete 180?	The one who turned out in the exact way I figured was, ironically, my sister. She got pregnant youngish (18), baby daddy ran off with someone else, and occasionally pops up to act like he's been a good dad. She's now married with 3 kids, and an alcoholic husband. I feel terrible for her, honestly . The 180 case was a guy who I had a major crush on. He was so nice, incredibly good looking, and super friendly. I recently heard, from a friend of mine, that he's still single, and works on oil rigs!	A high school classmate, who was so driven and adamant about never having kids. She was top of the class, head girl, had her choice of athletic scholarships, and academic scholarships. She went off to study aeronautical engineering at a top school. She dropped out of school, studied theatre for a while, but never finished. She travelled for a bit, and then returned home to open an ice cream shop. She now runs her store, and is the mother of twins with another baby on the way. Never ever saw that coming.	0
What interior design trend needs to die?	Grey walls. You can pitch it as sophisticated all you like, but it is going to be the equivalent of beige or white in a short decade or so.	Words on walls. I don't need to be told to EAT in the kitchen, or that the HAPPY family is built on LOVE. Of course that is personal taste and I don't really care what people do in their own homes!	0
How much did giving birth cost you?	I have insurance and I had complications. I paid about 15k all said and done for labor, delivery, recovery and baby care. That’s not including the 4K I owed to my OB for prenatal visits for 9 months.	My sanity. My body. My freedom. My selfishness. My laziness. My complete and total lack of direction in life. All. Gone. ;) Love my kiddos.	1
To the grown-up, fully certified adult women out there: how did you come to terms with all the stereotypical expectations?	By refusing all of them. I refuse to engage in gendered behavior in my relationship or anywhere else. It's been working out well so far. I'm 22 and in a relationship with my partner. We split things 50/50 as far as chores and finances. Don't accept anything less. If you start to compromise and let men treat you like a nanny or a maid, you'll never get out of that pattern. Stand up for yourself and demand equality from the very beginning.	Life is what you make it. Don't want to get married? Ok, don't get married. Don't want to have kids? Don't have kids. Don't want to take on the entire mental load? Don't date a child. There are plenty of households where both spouses share the housework and emotional labor. There are plenty of households with happy spouses that don't have children. There are plenty of happy single people. There are plenty of happy couples that never get married. I'm not gonna lie and tell you that you won't get pushback from people who think you should live the way they want you to, but just stand your ground and make your life into what you want it to be. Yolo. Curate your life to bring you happiness.	0
Are any of you also really tired of friends constantly staring at their phones?	There is a whole generation coming up that will be even worse then the current one. Everyone is becoming a slave to the smartphone...	I usually don't take out my phone when I'm with others unless it's to answer a call or show them something. It is rude to be glued to a fuckin' screen when you're with some one. I've actually hung out with some female friends of mine and they barely said anything, just on the phone or wanting to take pictures of us together to tag or what ever and I get home after not talking and grinning and bearing a picture or two (I hate them) and I'm tagged in a status and tagged in what ever pictures they managed to snap... but we really didn't socialize. I hate it. Everyone is so concerned with convincing every one else they are having a great time and a great life and all that shit but in reality they're pissing it away making a highlight reel on their phones. It's dumb.	0
How have you unknowingly Pavlov'd yourself, or another person?	If I'm with a group of people and they're taking too long to leave I jingle my keys. Since most people associate that sound with leaving, they usually get out the door in a few seconds without me nagging.	A lot of times my SO gets boners just having me around, fully clothed. I come home, he sees me, and then gets a boner. Also, my dog used to have a long lead we would put him on to let him wander the backyard without straying too far. It was made out of some kind of polymer so in the dead of winter I guess it got too cold and it snapped. I realized this when he was asking to go out in the freezing early morning, so I just attached the 2ft broken end to his collar and sent him out. He stayed right within the range the full lead used to have.	1
What are your thoughts on bagels? Favorite Kind? Favorite prep? Favorite brand?	Montreal style > NY style; my favourite kind is whatever has just come out of the oven, with plain cream cheese or even better chèvre melting inside it. I make my own, so… My kitchen brand is my favourite? I don't need a new bagel flavour; I'm a bit of a purist and I'm more than happy with black-sesame, herb and cheese, and pumpernickel.	* I love bagels. * I'm a simple woman, I prefer plain. * I like them toasted with butter or plain cream cheese. I also love to make egg and cheese sandwiches with them. * I tend to buy them from my local coffee shop, so I don't have a favorite brand. I do like Breugger's though. Yum.	0
Girls who have been "ghosted" by your boyfriend, what was the last text or conversation you had?	Mine was before texting was a thing. I was an unexperienced teen, he was 21 with a fast car. He came over my house when my mom wasn't home, and all of a sudden he got up and started putting his shoes on and said "I'm going to Jack in the Box." Totally ghosted me. Me and my friends STILL make jokes 30-years later about him coming back from Jack in the Box, or about how the line must be really long at Jack in the Box. I did see him working on a roof one day, a couple years after he ghosted me. I smiled, waved and walked on by.	He wasn't anything close to a boyfriend, but "send me a pic of u". Aaaand we're done. Not sure which of us was the ghoster, but it doesn't matter.	1
Anyone have stories about dating "red pill" men?	I haven't dated anyone who subscribed they're but I could definitely see an ex or two of mine subscribing now. I've had a free college guys try some PUA stuff on me and usually it just makes me laugh at them.	Went out with one. I posted the really bizarre story of this in another thread. But as for the pure redpill behavior, he couldn't decide whether he wanted to neg me all night, or desperately seek my comfort and nurturing when talking about his personal problems. Like he'd be talking about his parents being distant and then rebound with 'Why do you walk so weird, what's wrong with your leg?'. He preached about how true masculinity was his new goal in life, and got into an argument with me about whether PUA tactics actually work (after using them on me with no success). He yelled over me to explain it's just for ''stuck up bitches with their heads so far up their ass they won't give you the time of day''. Then ''Oh shit, I wasn't talking about you, you're not like the other girls, don't be mad''.	0
What companies are you making a point of boycotting and what companies do you make a point of supporting?	My shopping is more based on local/American made vs imported, but I intentionally avoid anywhere that champions Planned Parenthood over community health centers. So basically, anything Warren Buffett and George Soros own I don't touch.	Ticket master. Fuck their ticket fees, admin charges and card fees and fuck their customer service if an event is cancelled, postponed or for whatever reason you can't make it to the gig. I buy all my tickets direct from the venue now where I can	0
What has been your experience with a non-linear career path? Example (Art degree working in Medical field), went from a higher paying job to a lower paying job (Nurse to Starbucks barista), or changed jobs without getting a degree and no experience in the new job?	I left a successful career in web development to pursue biology, specifically conservation biology. I'll get back to you at the end of my masters about whether or not I can actually make a living...	I got a degree in manufacturing / industrial engineering and worked in oil & gas for a few years before I rage quit. I ended up landing a job in semiconductors. I had zero tech experience. I even did one year in electrical engineering my first year of college before I realized I *sucked* at it and transferred out of it. Life is weird.	0
Women of reddit, how do you deal with the 9-5 commuter lifestyle?	That's why I say fuck states and urban environments so dense you have to ride public transportation. +1 for the southeast, where I can live 10 minutes from downtown and still get to drive myself everywhere.	I love my time on the train. Perhaps I'm weird. But it's an hour of uninterrupted reading and music-listening time each day. Load up your phone or iPod with music, podcasts, and audiobooks. Subscribe to a few magazines. Get a few books. It can be frustrating when the train is delayed or overcrowded, definitely, but for the most part, I don't mind. Now if I had to drive, I'm sure I'd be insane.	0
Those of you who picked the wrong career (for you), when did you realize you weren't on the right track?	When I graduated, I felt kinda empty while everyone was really happy, I was glad for my friends but I couldn't get their feeling I was just enjoying it like a party or so, but I couldn't care less for my Engineer title, then I discovered my love for programming and then I got a work as Physics Profesor at a University while working as programer.	When I came home crying every night for being so miserable. Finished my contract, took a holiday and jumped into the deep end and became a chef/cook. Best move ever.	0
If you have had a threesome (or moresome) that included your SO, what was that like emotionally?	It was fun at the time, but quickly got ruined. The girl we slept with was my best friend. Things between her and I were fine and remained fine. (EX) BF turned into a shithead about it and tried to turn EVERY interaction I and friend had into "YOU GUYS SHOULD START BANGING NOW!" ...Like, dude, read the fucking room. We're talking about the impending diarrhea from TacoTacoTaco and trying to beat Katamari. Stahp.	We're having MFM, MFMF, MFM+ rather regularly and sometimes I (being male) can watch her having FF or FFF. It's strictly on a sexual level for us, we both really enjoy it, but we also have great sex when we're alone. So no bad emotions or other stuff for us. We did lose contact to a very nice couple since their male part couldn't handle the situation.	1
Women who didn’t have that “that’s the one” feeling right from the beginning with their SO, how are you holding up?	We met on a blind date. I thought he was a pompous ass. He seemed to like me. He kept after me for 6 months. When I moved to another town, he was the only person to call me and wish me luck. He called everyday to check on me. He became my best friend. He finally told me he loved me and asked me to be his. I said okay...22 years...18 years of marriage...and 5 children ago. He is the love of my life.	. Sometimes I think that the world can’t really handle that crazy passionate mad insane love for too long. You have to have two extremely healthy people because what those feelings do to us- is bring out every single worst characteristic we have ..... every issue we have. Because we get afraid .... and it rarely very rarely happens that you have two people that can handle gracefully that kind of fear - The best relationships are the ones where you are best friends... sex is one hour out of the day. What are you going to do with the other 23?	1
Fellow Asian women, to what extent have you been personally impacted by the rise of hate crimes against Asian-X due to the pandemic?	Canadian Chinese. I live in a neighborhood with many Asians. I personally have not been impacted since I work from home. However multiple asian-owned businesses on my block have been broken into multiple times. Unsure if it's racially motivated, and the police were not able to catch the culprits. One restaurant closed as a result.	Not at all. I don't leave the house often since we're in lockdown all the time, so the chance of having anybody reacting to me is very slim. I do feel a sense of solidarity with people who have been impacted though. Sometimes friends and acquaintances joke about the Chinese virus and I just tell them that's racist and they stop.	1
When you're sleeping on your period, how do you stop a blood flood from spewing out the top of your ass crack?	I tend to find I need /less/ protection at night then during the day, gravity works in my favour I guess. But then I have a mad dash to the toilet when I get upright again	Literally nothing. Haha You’re not supposed to wear a tampon overnight and I’m too wimpy to try those cups, so I just suffer through. If I wake up randomly in the night, great! I can clean myself up a bit. But during the first 2 nights of my period, that’s what’ll happen. I’ve made my peace with it.	1
Women who once had good prospects but then got hit hard by mental health issues, how do you deal with the feeling of not realising your potentials and being behind others?	I read somewhere that people with trauma often feel behind in life (because of the mental health issues they have to work on) and that's made me feel a little better about not being in the confidence, mindful mental state others seem to be in.	You know, I did get hit hard by mental health, I think I’m not realizing my potential, but then when I sit back in my Audi and look at my six figure paycheque, I realize I’m doing just fine.	1
What was your best father/daughter moment as a teenager ?	We go camping together, sometimes we bring the rest of the family, but mostly we just take the dog. My Dad is...big, not tall, not exactly fat, just big. He was telling dumb scary stories by the camp fire and he decided to embellish the jumpscare by throwing the small axe we used for the fire wood at a tree. We couldn't get it back *out* of the tree. A few years later we happened back upon that camp site...axe was still in the tree.	Unfortunately, I don't have one. He was arrested when I was 13 and in jail for a couple years. He is a mean, narcissistic asshole. Teen years was when I decided to end all contact with him.	1
Why do so many men answer questions on AskWomen?	It doesn't bother me if it's actually the best advice that was given in the thread and it was given without any condescension towards the women that have posted. Sometimes that happens and that's fine, because though the official purpose of this sub is to be a window into the female mind, it's really become an advice-giving thing and the priority should be good advice. It bothers me when you get the feeling that people are upvoting a male comment because it contradicts the majority of advice given by female commenters. Sort of like sending the message, "we didn't like your opinions on this matter, ladies, so we're gonna stick with *this guy*." That happens sometimes but I think it's a bit less frequent than the first scenario.	most of the questions have to do with dating advice, and when it comes to questions about becoming more confident and attractive as a man, men generally have the best answers. it makes perfect sense if you think about it. women haven't been on the journey of becoming an attractive man, but other men sure have made that journey. also, reddit is chock full of dudes with nothing better to do at work.	1
What things have you been asked for from a partner/FWB that were hard no's? How did they react?	The very concept of FWB is a hard no for me. Waste my time because I'm not *quite* hot enough for you to be with only me and you want to see if someone better comes along? GTFO with that noise, I'd rather just be single in that case than risking my safety, dignity and self esteem to be someone's walking fleshlight. I've been told FWB doesn't really mean that (so maybe I'm off base here), and maybe it's because I've been in a relationship for a long time, but to me, it's stringing someone along and it's basically telling someone "You're hot enough for me to get hard to, but not hot enough for me to actually want to date, so I'm going to waste away your fertile years while I try and find my Giselle." No freaking way.	Wanted me to sell my eggs, solely for our financial gain. He didn't have a job, was in college paid for by his rich dad. His dad was smart enough to have him on a comfortable but meager allowance for essentials. I worked parttime as a grocery store cashier, still in high school. We were pretty young (me 18, him nearly 21), but I was still deeply offended that he'd ask this of me before even trying to get a job. He was disappointed. Tried to coax me into it for a while. Needless to say.. we're not together anymore. I upgraded my self esteem and standards for s.o's accordingly.	0
If you think about someone you interact with regularly you don't like, what is the biggest reason you don't like them?	Co-Worker: She has a high-school education, a white trash life, is completely two-faced, runs crying to the manager if I'm "mean" to her, can't do her job, but still criticizes my work, and earns double what I do. I might be a snob, I can admit it, but I should not have to explain myself to such a horrible little person.	Everything revolves around him. I've never once seen him consider anyone else's needs or wants. He's quite literally the most selfish person I've ever had the displeasure of meeting.	0
Whats your opinion on men using makeup?	I think as long as they keep it minimal (to still represent as masculine) its an OOOOKAY for me^^ i actually introduced bf to skincares and bb cream, nothing for the brow and eyes tho. Cause boi his eyebrow is just purrrrfect. 🤣	Do whatever makes you feel like the most authentic version of you. If it makes you happy then go for it !	0
Who’s a stranger you will never forget?	I live down the street from a farmers market. I was walking to it one day and out of nowhere an older women said hello sexy. I had in so I asked her to repeat herself and she said your a fine looking man. I was honored and caught off guard. I said awwee thank you and kept walking.	When I was a cashier a few years ago, there was a lady with three kids that ran out of food stamps. Keep in mind, this was around Christmas time when grocery stores are SLAMMED! She had me ring out $350 worth of groceries, but only had a balance of $50. She apologized, expressed there is some sort of mistake, started crying, and began to put things back in her cart for returns. An elderly couple behind them saw this and instead of being nasty and impatient, they told me they would be happy to pay for her groceries, insisted her 3 children pick out their own candy bar, and uploaded a $100 gift card for her. They gave her a hug and wished her a Merry Christmas! I will never forget such kindness, ever. It's little things like this that make Christmas such a special time of year 😊	0
What is sex like when you and your partner are trying to get pregnant? Are you actively or sub-consciously thinking 'make a baby' ?	Husband and I have been trying for over two years...at first it was really sexy to do it without any sort of protection at all. Then it was a lot of sex while trying to figure out the regularity of my cycles. We've gotten that mostly figured out but now we're just frustrated at our situation. Maybe we'll just adopt?	Both times I got pregnant, we were very actively trying and I was charting. The times we had sex when I was fertile for me was pretty much like normal sex but occasionally I would think "maybe we are making a baby!" That's slightly weird, but didn't ruin it or anything. I do also think since there were certain days we knew we had to have sex to conceive, it felt a little more like a chore than something spontaneous and fun, but once we got into it it was more normal.	0
What’s something that your SO doesn’t know about you that could jeopardise your relationship?	I’m always conflicted about when to share the fact that I have bipolar disorder. Too early on and it’s unwelcome TMI. Too late and it gets misleading. So in the beginning, it feels like I’m holding on to a secret. But the reason I don’t feel bad waiting is because it’s pretty much a non-issue in my life. There’s a lot of misinformation about bipolar out there. People conflate it with personality disorders like borderline personality disorder and use it to mean “has volatile moods” when that’s not it at all. I also have zero symptoms since I’m on meds, so it doesn’t affect my life at all. Still, it’s their prerogative whether or not it’s a dealbreaker once I tell them.	Nothing. We're married, so if I thought anything could potentially end the relationship I would've told him before we got married. Theres nothing I wouldn't tell him.	1
What is your opinion about beautiful women complaining about being, well, beautiful?	I know I'm getting downvoted but I seriously think beautiful women who complain about being beautiful are really annoying and should shut up. Because, I don't know, there's something wrong with the phrase "I'd like to be ugly so that men will love my personality". What, do you seriously think ugly girls or even average girls get love more easily? Even ugly/average girls can be treated merely as sex objects. And also a caring man can have problems loving someone who's not beautiful because he doesn't feel attracted at all. So, well, to answer your question... a beautiful girl who's complaining about being beautiful, either doesn't know what she's talking about or wants to stress the fact she's beautiful.	Imagine you had red hair and that's all that anyone cares about you. Your red hair is complimented all the time. People say you cannot be that smart because of your red hair. People say you only got a job because of your red hair. People hate you or like you soley because of your red hair. People view bedding you as trophy material because of your red hair. Then people talk incessantly about how your life will be ruined, be over when you inevitably lose your red hair. People fetishise you and foist unwanted sexual attention on you every time you leave your house because of your red hair. You cannot wear a hat or dye your hair and you deal with this twenty-four hours a day.	0
Houseplant obsessed people: What are your hacks? Was it easier to learn about plants online or from a book? How did you learn to not kill plants? etc?	My fiancé says filtered water makes all the difference. I always used tap water and killed my plants. He keeps his plants alive with filtered water.	Easier to learn online. For my garden I have a few books I always reference, but it's just easier to google the needs of individual houseplants. For me the biggest thing was don't overwater! Lots of plants die from neglect but it's just as easy to overdo it. Practice makes perfect and you get a feel for it along the way. I ❤️plants	0
What piece of 'obvious' advice has saved your life?	"don't have sex with someone who you don't want to father your children and spend the rest of your life with, because if something goes wrong, your going to spend the rest of your life with him because hes your childs father"	Not quite so intense (and I'm glad you're okay!), but a college professor told me before leaving, "So many students overwhelm themselves trying to decide what they're going to do with the rest of their lives. You can change your mind." Obvious. Not always simple, but there is some room to use your education and life experiences to explore different options. Knowing that keeps me sane.	0
Formerly clingy ladies, what made you realize you were clingy or needy, and how did you deal with it?	I'm still clingy. I try not to be clingy to the point where I blow up his phone if I feel like he doesn't respond quickly enough; but I get all stressy about it and I get all sad when I feel he's being distant, I try to combat this by trying to not show any outward signs of being clingy and needy, which is fucking difficult. Honestly though, I think this also ties in with my anxiety; so I'm trying to work on my anxiety, so hopefully this will eventually ease up.	I'm clingy and needy. I tell my boyfriend to tell me if I am being clingy and needy. He accepts that I'm clingy and needy and I shouldn't have to be something I'm not. I probably couldn't be with someone that doesn't accept that. I like feeling close with my partner. He tells me if he needs alone time and it's all good.	1
How do you love and accept your body when we are all set against such high standards to look perfect?	I struggle with my body imagine but I just try to be kind to my body and remember that me being healthy is what's important. Whenever I'm insecure about my face or whatever it might be, I remember how complex the human body truly is and how lucky I am to have a healthy one that is capable of almost anything. I try to focus on my positive features like my cute smile, bright brown eyes, etc. I find that being in a good place mentally helps with accepting my body.	I tell myself that both genders are now being expected to look a certain way. Even men now are expected to look a certain way.	1
What is something that you know, due to professional experience, is absolutely not true but that people seem to believe despite having done no research whatsoever?	That sick food workers stay home until they're no longer contagious. This is what they're *supposed* to do, and many people assume that food workers stick to this rule. The unfortunate truth is, many food handlers have to work even when they're still very sick because they can't afford not to, there's no one else to cover them, or any number of other reasons. I'm not talking the common cold. I'm talking stomach flu. Its honestly one of the most distressing things I found out while working in the food service industry.	No matter what your landlord says, your apartment building has probably had bedbugs in it at some point. Possibly even in your apartment. Sleep tight.	1
Do you ever feel like your general sense of happiness is directly connected to your current body size?	I'm a lot happier fat than I ever was skinny. I mean back then I could enjoy delicious trashy food with reckless abandon, but literally everything else is better now. It's entirely possible I could be even happier, but I'm not convinced that would come from losing weight.	I am a fat girl. I hate the word fat, but it's the word to describe me. I am lazy. Fat people tend to be lazy. I was much skinnier at one point in my life. I lost 50 pounds and I was generally happier in life. Motivation makes me happy. So I definitely think my size correlates with my happiness. I am not saying I am depressed and that I am not happy. I am a happy person, but I could be happier.	0
Single ladies, what is your sex life like?	I feel the best way to explain my sex life would be to show you all the receipts from buying batteries. Edit: I can't spell	My sex life consisted entirely of a FWB. I've only slept with one person, and it was within that context. I don't have a sex life any more and I will continue to not have a sex life until I meet another person I can establish a relationship with (either romantic or FWB), or else until my ex-FWB is off the market again. I wouldn't have sex with someone I didn't know, so ONSs are off the table for me. I can't pretend to know what the norm is, though.	1
What has your SO done recently to make you feel loved, appreciated and/or happy?	I got home from a long day at work and the first thing I did was to spill out my freshly filled glass of water. He wasn't too happy about that, but he cleaned it up for me while I wailed in a corner.	He ordered from my favorite take out without telling me so it just arrived to our door right when I was commenting about being hungry. Woke me up by kissing my back.	0
What do you hear Women saying about Men that just makes your blood boil?	I have a co-worker who says things to the men in the office along the lines of: "I bet you're a good boy and help your wife clean at home". If a male co-worker called me a good girl, he would have to apologize or face consequences. The fact that she could get away with talking like that to a grown man is appalling.	Bigoted, generalized statements (ugh men always do xxxxx) especially from self-professed feminists. It's not so much that I feel bad for men, more that the hypocrisy enrages me. I see it on AskWomen from time to time.	1
For women who went off hormonal birth control, what was your experience like?	I tried going off it for close to a year after being on various pills for 4 years to see if I could get my sex drive back with my ex. It didn't work: turns out I just wasn't attracted to him anymore because he was a man child. I don't remember any emotional/weight/skin etc differences at all, honestly, but maybe I've just found the holy grail of BCP for myself?	I've been on hormonal birth control for about ten years (the pill for many years, Mirena for a few others and NuvaRing for a couple of months). I always had quite a low libido and sex would hurt often. I would actually get tears down there, so I wasn't fond of the act. Now I'm off birth control for more than two years. We use condoms and I couldn't be happier! I haven't had any tears anymore, at all, and my libido is way way up. And it seems I have my emotions in check more, but I'm not a 100% sure. I can still be quite emotional, but at least now I know it's because it's who I am, and not because of the pills I take. Eta: periods are way worse and skin is a bit worse too. Worth it though.	0
What work advice are you sick of hearing?	Managers giving the line "it'll all even out eventually!". While that may be true it doesn't justify something that's unfair for your employees at the moment!	"If it's making you unhappy, quit". Sometimes that is easier said than done. I would never quit a job unless I had something else lined up and that can take time with the availability of jobs, etc.	0
Non-white women, how do you differentiate (or do you) between someone who is attracted to your ethnicity and someone who is fetishizing you?	I'm white as far as anyone can tell, but I've been stereotyped in certain ways and it's never impressive. It's one thing to like red hair or smooth brown skin or a big ass or devotion to family or a freak in the sheets or w/e. It's another to assume someone will act a certain way because of the way she looks. That's just gross.	When guys tell me they've "never fucked a black girl" or "I wanna see that big, ghetto ass", it's usually a good tip off that a guy is just into me because of my race.	0
What has been your biggest "life isn't fair" moment thus far?	When we first met it was magic. She would call me three four times a day..........I fell for her. Within a three months she broke up with me to go to her birthday dinner with a fat ugly guy who had lots of money............I only found out about this later. She then pursued me again and after three more months of no obligation sex........dumped me again..............in the following conversations..........yes she still called me...............She admitted she was incapable of love and didn't like to be held. Fuck me.	Finding out we lost our first baby, then coming home my grandfather had a massive stroke and wouldn't survive the week. Life sucked that day.	0
Ladies, What subreddit that you discovered in 2017?	Over the summer I discovered r/letsnotmeet. I binged all the top posts over a weekend, and visit that sub every few days just to see the top posts of the week.	I've personally had a blast after I discovered /r/wewantplates and also /r/disneyvacation which isn't about disney at all but funny captions for those stock drawings on "how to do stuff" webpages. Hilarious stuff	0
Asian women of Reddit, what are your thoughts on the media stereotypes and portrayals of Asian women?	My girlfriend is Vietnamese. Some of the comments I receive from other men are downright disrespectful. That’s my girlfriend man!	Ethnics outside of Chinese and Japanese are virtually nonexistent. Koreans are making more of an appearance. Asians are either half white or looks... very Asian? I’m Asian American and I feel like I don’t look like the Asian women I see on the screen. I don’t look like Olivia Munn or Zhang Ziyi. Brenda Song is probably the closest representation but even we don’t look anything alike.	0
My coworkers call me a hippie just because I'm from Austin, Tx and I eat organic. What irritating thing happens to you at work?	Well, it depends on which side of the divide you're on. If you're pre-80s Austin, you're a real Texan. If you're post, there's a good chance you're a hippie. If you're a transplant, go back to California.	My boss is really weird and questions everything, like she thinks we're constantly lying to her and making stuff up. If she's never heard of it before, her first response is to think it isn't real. Example: Yesterday we were eating pizza in the office and some of my co-workers started talking about Showbiz Pizza and the animatronic band of animals from when we were kids. My boss suddenly got this weird look on her face and asked us what an animatronic was, then when we explained it, she had to go look it up because she didn't believe any of us. ...Why would we make some shit up like that? It irritates me.	0
What is the most cringe worthy trend right now?	Hipsters blatantly stealing from back culture, capitalizing off of it, and then getting mad and writing think pieces about "creative expression" When they get called out.	This might not be a thing in every country, but it became a trend among Turkish online stores as well as some bloggers to conduct a drawing for a prize on Instagram. They post the picture of whatever the prize is, you need to follow their account, repost the picture on your own profile with a hashtag to enter. My Instagram home page is becoming a product catalog in between animal pictures.	0
DAE not know what they want to do in life?	I have a history degree. And no interest in teaching. I'm five years into a career at a bank in IT. My job is the thing I do for 40 hours a week. I have had the jobs I thought I wanted and they were too intense and draining to do full time. I have no idea what I want to be when I grow uo. (Currently 29). I do know what kind of person I want to be: involved in my community, a good friend, kind of weird. My job pays for me to do things I love in my free time (see concerts, do Rocky Horror, work with local nonprofits, etc.). I'm okay with that balance.	ITT: A bunch of college grads that got degrees in fields that they know nothing about and upon graduating, found out that they hated it.	1
Women who cut off contact with their exes, how long do you wait to reconnect/reply to them, and how do you know when you're ready?	One of my best friends is an ex, and I'm very good friends with his fiancé. Although our relationship was short, and awkward, as we had been friends beforehand. It was more like a, we had discussed our "feelings" while drinking one evening, started dating and dated for a few months. We realized that we were better off friends, and terminated that. Now I'm going to be the officiant for their wedding. And the rest, good fucking riddance. My abusive ex (broke up August '14) *still* tries to contact me, and I just keep blocking each new number he calls/texts/emails from.	Ex and I split and agreed to a 6 mo. No Contact. I've called her a few times after that, and they were small chats. Once I asked her to watch my cat if she had time. As I was dealing with family issues. I sent her a text a few months ago and never got a replay, so I figure she has no desire to be friends post break up, so if she wants to talk to me she'll call or text in her own time. Meanwhile I've completely moved on and don't think about her at all. Shame I would like to have been friends but I guess some people really can't get past their past.	1
What’s something you dislike about Hollywood movies today?	Franchises. I only want the Disney Marvel Franchise. The star wars continuation movies suck so hard with the exception of Rogue One, which was made as a standalone. Every other franchise movie can burn in Hollywood hell	I'm sure this is a popular opinion but I'm tired of how so many Hollywood films now are remakes and sequels.	0
Is it right to monitor your child's full online history?	It's not only right, it's your *responsibility* to monitor your child's online activities. When they get around 14 or so, you can talk about *some* privacy (like with personal messages). You also need to have safeguards on any computer your kids are using, and you need to have occasional talks about being online and what is acceptable, and what is unacceptable. Then, you need to actually follow through and check up on them once in a while. If you just sit your kid down in front of a computer and let them do and see whatever they want, you're gonna have a bad time. The most important thing is to stay connected ... to your own kid. Talk to them, *listen* to them, actually *be* a parent, not a baby-sitter.	I don't know if it's "right" but I do know that I have some major psychological issues around trust as a result of my parents reading my chat logs, internet histories, and journals when I was in the 10-15 age range. I'm sure that there are times when that kind of breech of trust is justified, but in my case, I was smart and never got myself into any trouble that would justify them snooping like that - so the only result was that I got very angry with them and had trouble trusting them thereafter.	0
Adult women of Reddit, how did you stop waking up exhausted? Put another way- how do you wake up energized and excited for the day ahead?	Go to bed earlier. I *need* 8 hrs of sleep. If I don't get it, nothing is going to help me be perky in the morning. Having a consistent morning routine still gets everything done, but if I'm even slightly sleep deprived I won't enjoy it. Now days when I go to bed nice and early and sleep really soundly, those days I'll wake up naturally before my alarm goes off. I'll snuggle with my dog for a few moments and then roll out of bed to start my morning routine and not feel rushed.	Ever since I started drinking, I wake up too hung over to feel tired. I'm just super disoriented instead, which I prefer since it's requires less work.	1
Men who prefer posting here to Askmen, why do you?	Every question in /r/AskMen is about one of four things: 1. Sex 2. Fitness 3. Sex fitness 4. Fit sexness This sub is far more varied in it's questions. Also, piggybacking off /u/Ramblonius, I am not learning anything new from AskMen.	If I wanted a male perspective on something I'd just think about it. This sub let's me get a perspective on issues from the opposite sex. Though I will say that AM's shitposts and mod rants are far superior to the AW ones. You ladies need to step up your shitposting game.	1
Women who make six figures, what do you do for work? How is your work to life balance?	PM at a mid-size hedge fund. Make well over six figures - I was actually trying to figure out how much I make but because it's so complicated I can't. I work from 7am to about 6pm with a gym break mid day. I usually work half days on Saturday just cleaning things up. I work whenever the markets are open but don't travel constantly like I did when I worked at the bank, so that's nice.	I USED to have a six-figure income (about $115k gross) working as a mine geologist. I would spend two weeks at a remote mine working 12+ hours a day and living in a camp they had set up, followed by two weeks at home. It's a good lifestyle for a young person (lots of free time for vacations and enough money to get myself started financially) but I wanted to switch careers and work closer to home. I'm currently going back to school while working sporadic short-term geology contracts.	0
When it comes to finding an SO… what does "chemistry" feel like to you?	It's the kind of connection that makes you wonder if kismet is real. Yeah, there are the other parts that come along with having a "crush" or infatuation-being happy when they're around, butterflies, all that. But when you have chemistry, it's like you almost know what they're thinking most of the time. Like you're on the same wavelength. When it's easy, it's easy for both of you. When you're choked up and nervous, you're both choked up and nervous. When something funny happens, you lock eyes and laugh together. It's the kind of connection that doesn't need words to validate its existence. Nobody needs to say it's there because both of you feel it. Other people see it too. And when it's broken, for whatever reason, it hurts like you've lost a piece of yourself.	It feels like even though there is only one piece of the best cake left, you'd be just as happy to watch your SO enjoy it. It's being able to have fun no matter where you are/what you are doing. When we first started dating, we met up at Target to pick some things up and then we were going to hangout elsewhere. Instead, we ended up walking around the whole store, playing in the children's toys, and then finding ourselves sitting in kiddie chairs. We were in there for 2, maybe 3, hours talking and laughing. When we left, we held hands walking to our cars and he picked me up and kissed me in the parking lot for a few minutes. It's one of my best memories from when we first got together. :)	1
What about your relationship did you not realize was unhealthy until after you broke up?	I didn't recognize that a 26 year old willing to date a 17 year old was weird. No matter how "mature" I was at that age, I didn't realize how gross it was until we broke up... 7 years later.	I didn't realize I was trying too hard to be a good girlfriend and sacrificing my own need. It was ultimately unkind to both of us, and I ended really hurting him when I broke up with him "out of the blue" when I couldn't keep it up anymore.	0
Have you ever met a man that could be described as "high maintenence"? What was he like?	YUP. He took more time than me getting ready, but that's not what I am talking about -- I will never hate on someone taking care of their physical appearance. You do you! But he was very, very emotionally high maintenance. He needed constant reassurance that I was really into him. He got weird if I didn't text him daily to check in (yet always expected me to text him first?). He needed constant verbal validation. Like, he would take me out to dinner but then while we were at dinner talk consistently about how nice and expensive the restaurant was if I didn't remark on those things first. And I was young, so I gave him what he asked for without asking for the same things in return and without breaking down the emotional toll that his requests took on me.	As a dude who is high maintenance how do I stop being? Lack of experience in everything (from dating (cannot get past the second date to sex (never had))) some trama and a shitty social upbringing has made me like this and very insecure. I'm approaching my mid 20s and it never ends.	1
What are some ideas you cannot believe young, modern women still express?	The idea that anal/oral sex isn't "real sex" blows my mind. Blows the shit right out of it. Also, (and this I've only seen in teenagers, but it's shockingly prevalent in those I know) the idea that all women should weigh ____ pounds. In other words, the idea that regardless of height or bone structure or whatever, that all women should weigh the same "thin" amount. (I just had a come-to-Jesus discussion with my husband's stepsister that not every woman should weigh 115 to be healthy. Girl does not have a healthy handle on weight.)	All the stupid deep bullshit they always post on fb, im not against the bs itself but the fact that they keep saying all that cool shit on fb (stolen from somewhere ofc) and never ever do it themself. Men do it too but to a lesser. Oh yeh and the fact that they keep sending posts saying how much they love her friends or whatever, that's okay too but dont do it every fucking week... and well we all know next summer u wont be friends anymore, it's all for the likes.	1
What’s your experience with crying at work?	I just learned last week that before everyone knew my name at work I was known as “the one who cries”. So your one time thing is seriously no big deal! Even if you cried a bunch more, no big deal. :)	I’ve never cried in a meeting with multiple people but I have cried twice in a closed door meeting with my boss. I cry when I’m anxious and she’s a raging narcissist who totally went off on me out of the blue. I wish it hadn’t happened, but it’s been awhile now and I rarely think about it anymore. I’ve also learned how to handle her thanks to therapy, so it’s unlikely to happen a third time.	0
"Easy A" or "Mean Girls"?	I've never seen Easy A but I feel like I'm the only person in the world that doesn't love Mean Girls. I mean, it was cute and all but...meh.	How is this even a question? Mean Girls is the only correct answer. Easy A is funny but it's no Mean Girls.	0
What's something a former SO did that you didn't realize was unacceptable until after your break-up? What made you see the light?	He was a smoker. I tried to get him to quit but he wouldn't listen. It used to get all over my outfit and hair and everything :( So, so gross. Smoking has been such a big no, no for me since then.	- Called me a dumb bitch when I tried to calm him down when he was pissed off at a video game - "Borrowed" $800 from my mother because he was too busy buying new toys for his computer to pay attention to his bank account and wound up owing the bank said money in overcharge fees - Didn't seem to want to live more than twenty miles away from his parents - Took his laundry home for his mother to do Yeah, no. Really glad that one didn't work out.	0
Why are there so many guys answering questions in askwomen?	Honestly, it bothers me a little bit. But weirdly enough, it only bothers me when they answer the sillier types of questions. When serious questions pop up and they respond really contributing to the discussion, I don't mind and I usually appreciate their input. But when it is like, "women, what is your favorite book/movie/song/knitting pattern/whatever," it annoys me a little. Like, what is the point of men answering? It contributes nothing to what the OP asked, which is "Women, what is YOUR favorite [thing]." That said, its not like it deeply offends me. It just makes me roll my eyes. And I'm curious as to why they feel the need to have their voices heard in relatively unimportant matters.	Similar to women who answer on /r/askmen. They believe they have information that might help OP gain insight to whatever they want to know.	1
What are your secret or unpopular opinions on parenthood?	I approve of spanking a child. I was spanked as a child and I was one of those kids that you could have done anything under the sun else but the only thing that got me to listen was to apply pain when I did something my mom really didn't want. I don't view it as abuse and while I don't mind people who don't want to spank their children, it infuriates me when they try to shove their opinion down my throat saying I"m a bad person for seeing it as okay. You don't see me over here telling you that your kid acts like an entitled hellion because you refuse to discipline them, so do me a favor and unless actual abuse is occurring, butt out.	I wish there were more resources for prospective parents to find out if parenthood is really for them. I didn't want kids for years and everyone was like, "oh, you'll grow out of that." 25 years later, I have two daughters whom I ADORE, but the secret, honest truth is that I don't love parenting at ALL. I seriously just typed and erased that last sentence three times. Even on an anonymous forum, it is terrifying to admit. Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger! And to everyone for making me feel not so alone.	0
People with stupid names, how's life been treating you?	A guy I work with is named Daniel Daniel Daniel. He takes it in stride since a lot of people ask if this is really his name. He gives ever changing Joker like answer about how he got the name. My favorite is his dad lost a poker game and had to name his kid the same name first, middle, and last.	I once met a woman named La-a. Now let me ask you, how would you pronounce that name? Turns out it's pronounced Ladasha because and I quote "The dash ain't silent." Not sure how life is going for her now but I always found that to be the most unfortunate name I've ever heard. Edit: Why the downvotes?	1
What traditionally "good" things have you been made fun of/bullied for?	I grew up in a Japanese household and people used to make fun of me for eating weird food and raw fish because sushi was gross. Then sushi became a status symbol. Oh, how the tables have turned.	Maybe I'm just jaded but I feel like this post is either an invitation to humblebrag, or OP wanted a post on which to humblebrag and it didn't exist yet. Anyway, in all seriousness, people have thought my boobs were fake and made fun of me for it but jokes on them bc they're not even big?	1
Former thong wearers, what made you stop?	I wore thongs exclusively before I had a baby. Then I got hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids and thongs do NOT mix, let's just leave it at that.	I do it for working out. Under workout clothes, of course. Oh, what made me stop? I should read questions before I answer because I am wearing one now. Dang.	1
How did you wake up today?	Oh goodness that sounds awful! I woke up next to the new guy I've been seeing. He told me that in my sleep I grabbed his dick. When he tried to turn over/pull away, I turned with him to maintain my hold. I'm embarrassed but also proud that sleeping me for never letting go of what I wanted.... Never let go of your dreams.	i woke up after three hours of sleep to go feed animals at work, then returned home to take care of my dog who was attacked by the neighbor's dog yesterday. i'd much rather have a baby spider infestation and dive bombing wasps.	1
Childless bachelorettes over 35: How sweet is your life?	40/F here. Hubby and I have a great marriage, going on 18 childfree years. We have a lively little Husky puppy, who is the light of our lives. We also have a lot of very supportive family and friends.	Almost 35. Life is fine. Very few bills, lots of freedom and time. Traveling is my biggest hobby asides from photography. I don't like to stay in a place for too long. I also value my peace and quiet so it's nice to wake up and take naps whenever I want.	0
If you're wearing a skirt and have to use the bathroom, do you pull your skirt up from the bottom and your underwear down, or do you pull both the skirt and underwear down?	Always pull down. But mind you a lot of my skirts don't have the type of flowy-ness that would be pulled up easily.	Up! And if it's an especially light, wispy skirt/dress, I'll tuck it into my bra band through my top to hold it up.	0
Women who don't fit the Eurocentric beauty standard, how is your self esteem regarding your appearance?	It's great! Approximately zero percent of my self-worth is tied into my genetic appearance. My middle eastern family members are always talking about how to be lighter/skinnier/more white "passing" but I find that to be a concern more for the older generations who risked social isolation/oppression because of their appearance. I'm pretty priveleged to live in a place that generally celebrates differences instead of penalizes them.	Im a guy and i have the typical male beauty standards. I look good but i mean i can go somewhere and see like 20 guys who look just like me. Some of the most beautiful women iv ever seen dont have that euro look. You dont have to in order to be even good looking.	1
"Are you single? I have a son who is around your age..." Has this ever happened to you?	My mom does this all the time! "How old are you? My daughter here goes to [College]! Do you have a girlfriend?" I feel like crawling into a hole and dying. I feel so bad for the waiter or person, too, and usually mouth "I'm sorry" to them when my mom looks away.	Yes and it was very awkward. You should let your parents know that asking women out for you is pretty creepy and it shows a lack of confidence.	1
Can we actually get age range flair?	I already disregard relationship posts for kids under 25. There are big differences in how people think/work in their 30's and 40's vs. high school/college years. I WOULD like to know people's ages. Just a general category, like 13-15, 15-20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-35, 36-45, 45+	Alright, the mods have discussed this and decided that age flair would do more harm than good. Some people are uncomfortable sharing their age and even having the option would put a spotlight on those who opted out of specifying. We don't want anyone to feel as though they are being pressured to share any information they don't feel comfortable sharing. This is meant to be a place where everyone feels comfortable responding. We also don't want to risk opinions being discounted because of the age of the poster. An older age doesn't automatically equate to better, or more relevant, advice. Likewise, a younger age doesn't always equate to less relevant advice. Having age flair can result in perfectly helpful responses being overlooked. That said, people are more than welcome to share their age in their responses if they feel that it's relevant!	0
What's the most dangerous/stupidest situation you've put yourself in?	It was exam week and I had a half day from school. My ex texted me and told me to meet him at the pool where we were both on swim team because he had been dropped off there early and was bored. I told him no because I didn't trust him but he kept texting me and bothering me and he said we could just sit around and play cards and talk. I started feeling really bad for him so I went over there. It was a terrible position because we were in the booth where the people do the sound at swim meets and nobody was there and nobody could see us. Terrible day.	I once rode with a drunk driver. I didn't realize how drunk he was until he swerved into oncoming traffic.	0
Women who kept their maiden name, what are some of the negative comments you had received?	I have two last names. As in no hyphen. It was weird for people at first not knowing what to call me. But I answer to either and both. Think Smith Jones instead of Smith-Jones. So I answer to Mrs Smith, Mrs Jones and. Mrs smith Jones.	I have this coworker who can just not seem to accept that I will always keep my maiden last names. I'm from Puerto Rico and in my culture women don't usually take their husbands last name... that's actually really rare. The way it works is that babies inherent both their father and mothers last name, so every one has 2 last names (the first is their father first last name, the second is their mother's first last name). Anyways, my coworker hates that I have 2 last names and none of them are my husband's. The other day she had the audacity of saying, and I quote, "I really hate your last names and you should really consider changing them. You need to accept that you do not live in Puerto Rico anymore and need to embrace the American culture if you want to live here"... what the fuck!	0
What's a favourite thing your animal does, or a favourite moment you've spent with them?	Never had a cat. I've got 2 dogs now. The small one like to climb into my lap no matter what I'm doing. He sleeps best curled up behind my knees, and is currently "talking" to my husband. Hubby's ignored him today, and he wants attention.	My cat gives me eskimo kisses every morning when we wake up. He's so affectionate. I roll over onto my back and he stands on my chest. Purring like crazy. All I have to say is , "Can I have kisses?" and he leans over and rubs his nose on mine. He also does this adorable thing where he gets up in my arms and lays like a baby on his back. I give him belly rubs and he rubs his ear with his paw. When he's super happy he always rubs his ears. It's so cute.	0
If forced to wear historical clothing for a week, whqt decade would you choose?	I'm not sure what era they became popular in, but I really do like saris and other Indian dresses. I also like some traditional African clothing and style	Definitely Ancient Egyptian times. Wrap some comfy fabrics around my body, maybe have a boob or two out. Also the jewelry and kohl(?) eyeliner?? Yes please.	0
What's your favourite poem?	For Jane: With All The Love I Had, Which Was Not Enough - Charles Bukowski I pick up the skirt, I pick up the sparkling beads in black, this thing that moved once around flesh, and I call God a liar, I say anything that moved like that or knew my name could never die in the common verity of dying, and I pick up her lovely dress, all her loveliness gone, and I speak to all the gods, Jewish gods, Christ-gods, chips of blinking things, idols, pills, bread, fathoms, risks, knowledgeable surrender, rats in the gravy of two gone quite mad without a chance, hummingbird knowledge, hummingbird chance, I lean upon this, I lean on all of this and I know her dress upon my arm but they will not give her back to me.	I can see what you see not—Vision milky, then eyes rot.Then you see what cannot be—Shadows move where light should be. Out of darkness, out of mind, cast down into the Halls of the Blind.	1
How many people have taken some time to be alone and not date for 6 - 12 months?	I haven't dated anyone in just over a year but not because of any conscious "I'm taking a break" decison, simply because I'm just not.	LOL. This thread basically shows how women have it easier in the dating game. You're actively choosing to stay single for a decided period of time? And then when all is better with yourself you'll go out and get into one again. While I've been single not by choice the entire time.	1
AskWomen of color, what unique challenges do you face in day-to-day life that others are probably unaware of?	Two things popped immediately into my mind: * Wondering if my crush likes/dates/would marry a black woman. * Finding out friends are racist. I can never tell upfront because they are not the kind of racists who run around spewing the n-word. I find out later after they've gotten comfortable enough to let little comments slip. They think I won't be offended because I'm "like them and not like other black people". The majority of these comments come from other minorities. Edit: Formatting	Could you ask this question and fornulate it like AskMen of color, what unique challenges do you face in day-to-day life that others are probably unaware of?	1
How often do you receive oral?	I've been with my husband almost 4 years and he has literally never done it. I love it, but it's just something I have to deal with.	As a guy who's absolutely terrifying of even trying this, can I ask other guys what's the appeal of this?	1
What's the most memorable time a guy didn't catch that you were flirting with him?	Once I never made eye contact or talked to this guy I obsessed about. I can't believe he had no idea!	The other day I came home from work really horny and told my fiance to take his pants off. He was like "Why?"	0
What is something completely petty that has made you smile in the last 24 hours?	Got a notification that someone in my contacts list has joined LinkedIn. Turns out it's my ex boyfriend. And it turns out that in the 4 years we haven't spoken, he's done sweet fuck all with his life, at least professionally. Hasn't held down a job for more than a few months at a time and his current position involves manning the coat check at a conference centre. Meanwhile I've gotten a great job, considering my second career step, and my life is moving forward. It's suuuuuper petty but like ... Dude was a man child. The fact that he still hasn't gotten his act together kind of proves the point for me and is pretty satisfying.	Someone had once learnt I have a crush on him and had used it then to tease me and made me feel I am being inappropriate. He texted me the other day that he would love to take me out and do me when he is in tow. I let him know I have someone right now. But I felt all smug about the whole thing.	1
Men browing this sub, what are you hoping to learn or what have you learned by hanging out here?	Wasn’t hoping to learn one specific thing. Was just painfully aware that there was A LOT I didn’t know, so I joined hoping I could get some much needed perspective, a chance at seeing the picture from the other side...	I've learned that women are so critical about every facet of the man's role in the relationship yet don't give men any hint to the fact they're being judged on every micro behaviour against some invisible scorecard of how men should behave. It's like women see men as some type of perceived level of how a man should be, then are constantly scoring them against that model in their mind. Down to quite intense levels of scrutiny that the men have no idea that they're even being judged against a list of qualities that the women has in her mind that she wants from him. &#x200B; That isn't a criticism, merely an observation on how different we are in our approach towards living with a potential partner.	1
Who is the creepiest guy you encounter on a regular or recurring basis?	SUPER CREEPY DUDE ALWAYS AT MY JOB. Seriously, every time I go to the bathroom, there he is in the mirror staring at me...	There's this guy who's a regular at my place of work. I change my hair color a lot. He always asks my if my pubic hair is the same color. Fuck my life.	0
Please tell me your experiences with not being close with your siblings in adulthood. Had it had negative consequences on you?	i came out as bi/lesbian woman and my brother who i was close to has quit talking to me, my oldest brother was super mean growing up and we never got close *ever*, and my little brother is sweet but introverted to a large degree. i wish i was close to a sibling	My brother and I don't talk. We're in our 30s, 3 years apart, and live in the same country. So we could talk, but we don't. We don't dislike each other (I don't dislike him and I don't think he dislikes me?) but we just don't talk. I don't think it really bothers me. I don't think it really bothers him. When we're visiting our dad together we still talk and bicker like we just saw each other yesterday. I don't feel any level of awkwardness that we didn't talk in the half year - year prior. I think it bugged my mom that we don't talk, though, I think she had a vision we'd be friends or close family as adults.	0
Women who have posted "me too" on social media, what have the responses you've had been like?	I have seen a LOT of feminists get pissy about it bc those who claim Me Too aren't doing it right apparently... So many links to Huffington post articles man	A lot of apologies and silent support from friends. A couple of guy friends also posted "me too". It's so sad. It shouldn't happen to anyone, ever.	0
What's the best orgasm you have ever had?	My ex bf was just amazing at going down on me. he just had a knack for doing it or something. I could chain together orgasms from it and they would hit me in succession it was totally unreal and I just melted into the floor. later he came out as gay (or bi?) and hes dating a guy now for a few years.... SUCH A WASTE OF TALENT. One of gods great jokes I think	My SO recently. We had a lot of foreplay and I don't remember exactly what we did differently this time, but oh my goodness.... I came like 5 times in a row and we had to stop before he finished because I started hyperventilating because I think I forgot to breathe. It was amazing. And hilarious having him coach me through breathing.	0
What’s your “no good deed goes unpunished” story?	Before Trump was elected I tried and tried to do good by pointing out the many ways that he is not fit for office. My warnings were not heeded. Our punishment is that now we have a person that proves every day he is unqualified for the office of president of the United States. (edit) It's been one month since this was posted. Speak up people. Let Trump supporters know that this man is still unqualified for the office of president of the United States. Don't let down voters have their way with this comment.	A few years ago I’d walk by this homeless woman every morning, and she was always asking for money for a cup of coffee. One cold morning I felt really bad for her, so I decided to give her some change I had in my pocket. That’s when she decided to pull a knife on me and demand all my money.	0
Ladies, how do you know your SO is also truly your best friend?	I’m extremely introverted, but I can spend 24 hours a day with him and never feel drained. Spending time with him actually recharges me. He’s my safe place.	Honestly, he's not. And we're both okay with it. Is he my best friend? Yeah. But, he's not **the** best friend. That honor goes to someone else	1
How do you handle other women who are aggressive and condescending in the workplace?	Change your perspective. Watch how she communicates and take notes of her work ethic. Not only will you learn from it but sooner or later you will carry that trait also. If you don’t care to move forward at your work place then just think of it as a pay check and nothing more. You just wanna make money and go about your day.	I try to avoid this situation, shrug it off. When I don't like someone at work I only deal with them as much as my professional capacity demands, and only professionally. I try to transfer away from that person as soon as I possibly can.	0
Did you ever like a guy but hated the way he dressed?	Married him. :) Clothes are replaceable. He has gotten somewhat better over the years but I didn't marry him for his style.	He's it was my boyfriend. I taught him so well that now people at work (we work together) compliment him more than me	1
Those of you who have been on dates with redpillers/PUA/super sexists douchebags, how did it go ?	I have to ask, what is a reppiller and/or PUA? I have never heard that before. I am a guy just being nosey since this hit the front page?	Yeah, there was this guy that I kinda dated for a while. Not only did he neg me all the time (that was before I even knew what negging was), I found out through mutual friends that he was telling everyone he was only dating me because, and I quote, "Depressed girls put out so easily". I proceeded to break things up before ever sleeping with him, so there's that.	0
How did you learn to discern your gut reaction from unhealthy reactions that resulted from abuse?	I mean the best thing to do is to talk about it with your SO or friend (whoever you’re close with that you’re getting bad vibes from). If the person reacts negatively like “I don’t know what you’re talking about, why would you get upset about that?”, something like that, then you know your gut feeling was correct. I, sadly, have always been right with my gut feelings but have never believed them.	Therapy. That is one of the things therapy is good for: keeping past traumatic experiences from being intrusive in the present day.	0
What made you realize you'd fallen out of love?	When we would hangout, I would wish we weren't and that I was doing something else. It just wasn't.. fun anymore. It was boring, but in the way a lecture class is or a long car ride with no music. My current relationship is predictable, but it isn't dull. We have a lot of laughs and talks. It's very stable and safe. The one before it sucked. It just seemed drawn out. Thinking about being apart didn't bother me.	(guy here) WOW. I think every man alive should read this thread and learn what NOT to do. It is like a goldmine of self-improvement for men.	1
What's the worst way that a workplace fucked you over?	My boss was gone for the first month of my new job. She made up a 12 page list of protocols for me to learn and follow on my own. The 12 pages still wasn't enough detail for all of her rules. She was passive aggressive, she talked poorly about me to other employees, she made a habit of switching my day off so that she could have weekends off, actually I wouldn't know when my day off was until the day before when she told me. I worked there for 7 miserable months. The day I quit she started throwing insults at me and why I was a terrible employee. She is on the top of my shit list.	Boss verbally gave me a raise. She said it would appear starting on my next paycheck. I didn't have it in writing and she didn't give it to me until my next one after that. I did the math, and saw she shorted me approximately $80. Now I make sure everything is in writing.	1
While having sex or making out with a guy, did he say or do anything that was an instant moodkiller?	First time I had sex, my boyfriend at the time attempted dirty talk and said "Oh yeah... That's my DICK." I felt too awkward and it was too funny to continue. As I mentioned in another recent thread, the boyfriend before him called me mommy while making out. Ew, ew, ew.	Ahaha, I was JUST talking about this to some friends. My ex was really into chatting during sex, and I wasn't feeling tooo intimate. Essentially, I just wanted to get laid. Spooning position, he leaned over into my ear and asked, "yeah, do you like when I make love to you?" It was like he hit an instant "eject" button for my vag.	1
What is something you often hear men say they want in a woman, but you think they wouldn't like if they actually got it?	As a man, I can you tell you one thing is big boobs.... If you see enough big boobs you KNOW its hard to find a skinny girl with big boobs and big boobs that do not sag. Getting older I am sure this only is less a possibility....	I'm an extremely plain, conservative dresser, and my husband always thought it would be super fun if I wore sexy clothes to go out with him. I wore a moderately low-cut dress once. He noticed that a ton of people were looking at my boobs. He enjoyed this much less than he thought he would. Sexy clothes have not been brought up since.	0
What's your roomate from hell story?	This is so minor compared to everything people are going to say, but it really wore on me all year. She would stay up until 3 am texting with the keyboard sounds on.	He was a food labeler. He wrote his name on food. For me this has always been a roomie dealbreaker. I know many will think me unreasonable. I think it’s an affront to the idea of communal living (which is what roommates is). You use it, replace it, even better replace it twofold then we are well stocked. And happiness ensues. This is not an office, it’s a home. We’re in it together. I was also his boss and responsible for him having a salary, great contacts, etc. opened up know home to him, a food labeler...	1
For Women That Barely Date: What Are Your Reasons?	I’m ugly and im transgender. It’s not really my choice not to date. Edit: I don’t care about being downvoted but it sucks you can’t have a negative reason to not date here	It's very rare that I meet people I'm genuinely interested in. When I do, they're usually friends first that fade into something more. Dating a near stranger for the sake of dating in and of itself is not very appealing to me.	0
Which animal's mating ritual are you most glad is NOT the way WE seduce each other?	Male moose pee in the dirt and then roll around in the urine mud puddle they made. The female moose find this very arousing and are drawn to the delightful scent. They soon mate. I am glad men do not roll around in their urine in the mud and expect us to find that attractive.	Female hyenas have a penis-like structure they can rape the males with. Though I think it would be cool to have a prehensile penis-like appendage, I don’t think raping my mate would put him in the mood.	1
What's a common opinion expressed by your male friends that makes you sad/frustrated?	Whenever a female teacher is caught with a student, it's high-fives all around. They never stop to ask themselves if the student was even consenting (although still a minor). It's like it never crosses their mind that the kid could be an unwilling victim.	"It doesn't matter to me what my girl decides to be as long as she's happy and not a sex worker." I get that they don't care if she's a doctor or lawyer but people take pride in their profession so it sucks that they could care less.	1
You are given unlimited funds to host the most fabulous garden party ever. What theme, food, drinks and desserts would you choose for this party?	I'd go with an Asian themed party. The garden would look like a Japanese garden. Guests would have the option of changing into traditional clothing upon arrival. The food, drinks, and music would be from across the entire asian continent, and specialists would be hired to make sure it all came together nicely. Traditional dances and folk tales would be told, and the night would end with a massive fireworks display.	I would have an elaborate hedge maze constructed. But what the invitees don't know is that the first to reach the center will be killed. The garden party is now a murder mystery party.	0
Have you ever received any backlash for dating someone considered "superior" to you (looks, class, race, personality, etc)? If so, what happened?	I've been married for almost 12 years, and I still often get "THAT's your husband??" when I introduce him to people. Ok yeah, he's a little better looking than me, but I'm not a troll, jeez. Not exciting, but that's pretty much it. Mostly I just make jokes about it.	I don't go after people who are far more attractive than me. If a super pretty girl asked me on a date sincerely I would say no.	1
Why can I only masturbate to lesbian porn?	Question for the women here... why does the woman's pleasure turn you on, if you're straight? Does gay porn appeal to you? Why or why not?	Yeah, it's very common. If you search this sub for "lesbian porn," you'll see many threads about this. Lesbian porn tends to focus more on female pleasure (*authentic* or at least plausible female pleasure, not that "every woman can have screaming orgasms from penetration alone" bullshit) and it also tends to be more gentle, sensual and romantic than a lot of straight porn.	0
What is the best example of double standards that you have witnessed?	The rising tide of "guilty until proven innocent" situations when it comes to rape accusations. A woman who claims "rape" is to be believed with little to no evidence. The man accused must prove his innocence beyond a reasonable doubt to not face consequences. I'm sorry, but putting the power to destroy someone's life in the hands of a vengeful person, male or female, is irresponsible and wrong.	Praising sons for being sexually active but feeling the need to protect daughters from guys because "they know how guys think" Encouraging girls to do traditionally masculine things (wear pants, male dominant careers, watch sports, yadaydada) but discouraging boys from participating in traditionally feminine things (wear skirts, play with baby dolls, female dominant careers, cry)	0
Let’s do some awareness. People with chronic/invisible illnesses, what do a typical good day and bad day look like for you?	I have rheumatoid arthritis. On a good day I have some stiffness in the morning but otherwise I can function fine, and handle my physical job fine- sometimes I need a nap after work since with RA comes fatigue, but not always. Bad days I'm bedridden for several hours after waking up due to stiffness and pain, and have heavy fatigue and have to nap several times during the day- on the worst days I also experience chest pain, dry eyes, and headaches. I have no choice but to call out of work those days, and even just doing that simple thing hurts a lot.	I am autistic, and have issues with my anxiety and depression. A average good day for me is I wake up, interact with siblings, stay awake after they leave, do chores, maybe do some writing if I'm not going through writers block, indulge special interest, talk to friends and family, and some stimming. A bad day for me is when it's hard to wake up, I don't want to interact with my siblings or might even snap at them which makes me feel worse, want to take naps but I can't, have to be pushed to do chores, writing is really hard, special interest can't hold my attention, and talking to people is incredibly hard, even if I know that talking about it does help me.	1
Women who have had an abortion...what's something you wish you would've known beforehand?	I was gonna abort but I went to abortion counselling first. After that I felt I was more informed about pregnancy so I felt more confident about keeping the baby. I am grateful for having my son now. Without the counselling I would have gone straight to abortion without any hesitation. So I think many girls who are not sure- maybe hearing it from both sides will help you make an informed decision.	How much better I would feel immediately afterwards and how much worse people would make me feel about it later on. No regrets though!	0
If you taught a high school English class, what 5 or 6 books would be on the curriculum?	A lot of Slaughterhouse Five in lists. I read it in 11th grade as part of an assignment where everyone chose a different book from a list to read and present on. It was marked as having "questionable content" as a warning. I had classmates who changed "damn" to "dang" and "god" to "gosh." I can only imagine the kind of drama that would ensue if they tried teaching it to all students. Good old Utah. (To answer the question: My favorite books during school were "Fahrenheit 451," "Animal Farm" and "The Count of Monte Cristo," so I'd include those. "Heart of Darkness" was read in my senior year and is probably my least favorite book ever. I'd definitely exclude it from my list.)	As someone who was forced to read enormous piles of 'the classics' and hated almost all of them, here are my choices: She's Come Undone, by Wally Lamb A Prayer for Owen Meany, by John Irving I Who Have Never Known Men, by Jacqueline Harpman IT, by Stephen King The Harry Potter series, JKR I would love to focus on popfic, obviously, and really get kids/young adults into reading for pleasure. I thought I didn't like to read until I was about 14 or 15 years old. No, I *love* to read! I just don't like what the schools kept giving me.	1
What was a small habit you adopted that made the biggest difference in your appearance and well-being?	Not so much one habit, but many habits that I slowly dropped over time. It started with cutting out soda and candy, and over the course of about two years turned into what I can honestly say is an almost completely healthy diet. I lost 40 pounds and have kept it off effortlessly for 14 years. I think making small changes on my own time instead of changing everything at once was my key to success. I gave myself time to focus and adjust to each small change, so I was never overwhelmed or felt deprived.	Working out. Especially running! It lifts your booty and flattens your tummy and fixes your posture so your boobies look perkier lolz.	1
Does Facebook and/or Instagram depress you sometimes?	Nah. Maybe it's because I'm quite content with life right now, but if I see a bunch of people I know looking good or doing well I think, "Good for them!" not "Boo, I'm not good enough." I also enjoy the validation I get from lots of 'likes' or comments on a picture or status.	Yes, that's why I quit facebook. My life is pretty great, but I kept seeing other people do all these awesome things. Well it's different people so of course there's going to be a lot of awesome stories, but it made me feel my life wasn't as awesome. Although it actually was. When I got obsessed with likes, I quit. Very suddenly. Mom is still sad I left facebook.	0
What was your biggest "It's not what it looks like" moment?	Sharing a bed with an engaged friend while we spooned and watched Disney movies. I know that to outsiders it looks like an excuse, but he really was just that good a friend.	Well I'll answer this but it's nothing to do with sexy time. In college there was a massive pond near by with all sorts of waterfowl and I used to joke around with my foreign housemate about how delicious they looked, which horrified my poor housemate. Now our flat was on the ground floor and one day, having left the window wide open, I walked into the kitchen to find a very confused and unhappy duck. I'm pretty used to handling animals but this duck gave me a bit of a runaround. I finally managed to get the duck in a safe handling position so it couldn't flap when my housemate walked in. Picture: me, standing by the oven, holding a distressed duck. "PM_ME_FLUFFY_BUTTS WHAT ARE YOU DOING? PUT THAT DUCK DOWN!"	0
Those who have or have had a low libido, what did you find that helped increase it?	Losing weight and cleaning up my diet. I think part of it was that I just didn't feel attractive. But also I was just tired all the time and bloated, and I really think a shitty diet can mess with your hormones. I focused on getting healthy (losing weight was just a by-product of that). I have so much more energy and confidence.	Discovering cohabiting partnerships are my reason of anxiety and low libido. Discovering that monogamy was not for me. Discovering that I'm much happier with multiple partners and variety of sexual encounters.	1
How often do you get asked out in real life?	Actually asked out, like "Can I take you to dinner?" is rare. "Do you wanna hang out sometime?" is less rare but not *often.* Trying to actively hook up with me that night happens *all* the time. Who said romance is dead?	It’s sad that the majority of answers are never. But, never. Guys just don’t seem interested in the “date” anymore. It’s sad really.	1
Have you ever been uncertain of your feelings towards your SO, particularly when you first started dating?	With my boyfriend and I it was nearly instantaneous. I've never been the type to actively pursue a guy, but with him it was different. He apparently felt the same way about me. He hadn't dated in 4 years and I had been in and out of abusive relationships. The only reason we didn't label it right away was that I was trying to tell myself it wasn't a relationship. Ha. Everyone I knew, *knew* it was. Now we're going stronger than ever.	Kind of. I was a bit distrustful of my ex because he had cheated on every girlfriend he had ever had before me. He ended up cheating on me too, so that ended things - but, to be honest, I wasn't far off ending things anyway. Ultimately, if it doesn't feel right, and you don't think it is something you can/want to work on, you're better off cutting your losses and moving on. Just my opinion.	0
Ladies of reddit: what's your side hustle?	I'm a personal assistant for temporary hire- basically I'm a detail-oriented bitchwork assistant. People can hire me to do their groceries, run errands, fold their laundry, walk their dogs, scan/file papers, upload their items to ebay or amazon for selling. I'm a trustworthy multi-tool for people who don't have family members that can be slaves for them. Great for small business owners and single parents! People can hire me once or seasonally.	Because I'm shy, people are shocked to also find out that I'm hilarious and have a great sense of humor. Apparently the two can't be mixed.	1
What's a piece of unsolicited advice you would love to give someone, but you're too decent a person to say it to them?	"You don't need that (insert food item here)" To almost every overweight person I see. It's fucked up, but it just goes through my head.	To my really good friends: "I love you both but you guys REALLY need to take care of your cats and change the damn litter box and get them fixed. Your apartment smells so bad I had when I walk in. Your unfixed male cats spray everything and it's disgusting. I saw one of you earlier and YOU reeked too. You probably can't even notice it anymore, but it's fucking gross."	0
Single woman in your 30s, how do you comfort yourself when you crave affection from a partner?	My husband is a drug addict. Heroin. I want to leave so bad but I’m afraid of being 30 with two cats. I’m also not as thin as I was in my 20’s and what if I’m not as compatible with anyone else. I wish I was as strong as you single ladies.	One thing my dad taught me is that you can give yourself love and the comfort you desire. That moment there's an automatic switch that no one can love me and take care of me the way I do. So when a man enters my life he better be sweeter than solitude.	0
What is something you know that you wish you didn't?	When I was in high school, I found my parents' sex pictures. It was so unexpected and out of place, I stared at them way longer than I should have trying to figure out what the fuck I was looking at. It looked like legit amateur porn or something, and I didn't realize they were my parents until it was far too late. I wish I could forget.	Not eating starch (glucose) causes hair loss. Not eating meat means you have to supplement. Eating out means generally eating poison unless you spend a whole lot of money eating at the finest places.	1
Do you have angry sex?	I’ve never had angry sex. Sometimes I think I’d like to but when I’ve brought it up to my partner he’s always said he had angry sex in past relationships (that weren’t healthy) and it’s not something he wants to do with me. I guess I’m special?	Nope. If I'm angry with him I usually don't want to be in the same room, let alone have sex.	0
Women who grew up watching Disney princess movies. Do you feel that these movies affected how you thought of relationships or how a woman should be treated?	After reading some comments turns out I have never seen Beauty and the Beast, it sounds fucking creepy. I just assumed all Disneys were viewed. Huh, wonder what else I have not watched? Pretty sure GOT has sought out any princess dreams I had, would still take a dragon anyway though	They gave me unrealistic expectations about wild animals being my pets and/or helping me with my chores. That's about it.	0
Ladies who in their mid 20s were afraid of never finding love: have you eventually found it despite your fears, or did you overcame the fears first, and then found him? How old were you at that time?	In my 20s I was always worried I'd never find anyone, I'm 38 now and still haven't found anyone, so I was correct.	My case was a little different. I didn't date until I was 25, but I knew I wasn't ready yet. When I was ready, I put myself out there and met people. I met my boyfriend through online dating. And I met my girlfriend through mutual friends.	1
For women who are not in a monogamous relationship, how exactly is the relationship structured?	We are an average couple where sex with others is allowed. When I first started dating him I was in a relationship with another man, I was sleeping with and seeing them both regularly. No one belongs to anyone. Ever.	I'm poly in a V with two men. They're not in a relationship with one another but are good friends. We all live in the same apartment. They're free to have other partners.	0
What is something people list as a red flag about a woman but you don't agree with it?	I'm baffled by the number of people who make statements on the internet about how fat women "don't take care of themselves" or "let themselves go" or "don't care about a healthy lifestyle." I mean, I realize the media tries to sell us that message, but how can you know and interact with actual human beings and still hold these beliefs? Look at the fat women out for evening powerwalks, swimming at the Y, shopping at the health food store . . . How are all these healthy-living fat ladies invisible to others?	If she doesn't have a lot of friends or if she doesn't go out often. I have a small handful of friends and they're quite busy. We have our own lives and our different schedules. They rarely, if ever, go out and drink. I don't drink because I lack alcohol tolerance. I'm actually quite social at work and in my neighborhood. I'm just not the one to go to bars with girlfriends. I keep myself busy through hobbies. (I'm an "ambivert".)	0
How can you tell whether you're in love with someone or just in love with the idea of being in love?	I knew I was in love, when I wanted to marry this girl, but saw she was really happy with a different guy, so instead of trying to ruin their relationship, I was happy for her, and shoved away my pain, to see her happy.	You enjoy spending time with them now. You like their personality, characteristics and values as they are. You're not looking to change them or hoping some big gesture will magically improve everything. You're not forget waiting for the next step of commitment. I think in the most stable and healthy relationships, those big milestones are only affirmations of how you already feel and not an expectation of how you world feel.	0
What do you consider "too far" when your fiancé has their bachelor party?	Touching and kissing. I understand they may wanna see stripers and have lap dance but keep your hands to yourself. Maybe a boob grab. MAYBE. If he really thought he needed it but no kissing and no genital touching.	The same things I'd consider "too far" on any other day of the week. It's a party, not a hall pass to be an asshole - new boundaries shouldn't have to be created for a bachelor/bachelorette party alternate universe. Be safe with yourself and others, no cheating based on what's already been established as personal boundaries in the relationship.	0
Do you think female masturbation is a taboo?	If it's wrong...I don't want to be right. I wouldn't say taboo is the word but perhaps "shameful" would be the right one. Maybe your parents catch you and you get scolded. But it is no where in the same ballpark of taboos such as blowing a goat.	Only just slightly more than male masturbation is. People who disapprove of one tend to disapprove of the other, but I think that most grown ups expect that masturbation happens.	0
A company promises you a lifetime supply of their products if you get a tattoo of their logo somewhere visible. What company is it and where do you put the tattoo?	I would go for a large pharmaceutical like Bayer or Pfizer. While I'm young, it would be cool to have free contraception&vitamins; when I'm old, medication for age-related diseases wil relieve me of a lot financial pressure. I guess I'd put Bayer logo on my arm, it'll look fine.	Guyaki Yerba Mate... Leafy planet logo on my ankle for sure, and a lifetime of Bluphoria, Lemon Elation, Orange Exuberance, and Rebel Berry! No mint though. They can keep it.	1
I just watched Magic Mike and feel very inadequate. Is this how girls feel all the time about how women are portrayed in media?	Maybe insecure women and teenage girls. I don't feel inadequate because I know everything you see in the media is air-brushed and sugar-coated and there are flaws in all of us. Also, everyone is 'real' even if they seem perfect.	I'd say yes, but differently. Like some of these other ladies have said, we get slightly used to it. I honestly have never felt adequate. I don't know what it feels like to suddenly feel inadequate, because that's how it's always been. But it's worse. Magic Mike was advertised as a fantasy, something known to be unrealistic. Models in magazines, thin beautiful actresses, are represented as more normal than the guys in magic mike. edit: I'd like to say thanks for the gold, and I have genuinely loved this discussion.	0
In your current/previous relationships, what have you taken for granted?	I had a partner for 6 years who never lied to me. He wouldn't even give in to subtle white lies. Honesty in the purest form was incredibly important to him. And since I've had relationships with other human beings who lie, even though it's mostly small insignificant lies, I've realized just how much I took for granted that kind of security and ability to trust spoken words. My most recent ex, as terrible as he was for me, was very receptive to relationship tactics I learned in therapy. Things like sitting him down just to tell him how he's made me feel good lately or specific things he does that make me happy or frustrate me, etc. My current partner is just not into that at all, and I really took for granted having someone who willingly embraced that robotic approach to emotions.	With my first boyfriend I took how fun he was for granted, he was a blast and always wanted to do stuff. After a few slug-people I found another fun one to date though.	1
Women of ask reddit, what are you STILL salty about?	Theology prof said at the start of the semester that he doesn't care if we're not religious as long as we're true to ourselves. Got a poor grade and almost repeated the year.	When we told my FIL we were having a girl, the first words out of his mouth were, "Well you can try again." That was over 10 years ago, and it instantly came to mind when I read this question.	0
For those over 21, who have a baby face and are petite, when did you feel like you started being treated like a "woman" instead of a girl because of how you look?	I'm almost 26 but without dressing up or wearing makeup, I pass as under 18. I was ID'd for a rated R movie on my 25th birthday. At work is the only place I feel like I don't get treated like a teen because I dress like a granny when I have to be in business casual.	I’ve pretty much been treated like a woman since middle school, long before I was one, because I’m plus sized and very curvy. Being petite doesn’t seem to matter. EDIT: Thanks for downvoting my experiences assholes.	1
What should men do when ladies cry in front of them?	The same thing he should when a woman does anything else. Mind his own business and leave her the hell alone unless she asks for his input.	In my opinion (and this applies to women too): * Offer them a tissue. * If you know them well enough, sit beside them and maybe put an arm around them. * When they're done crying, offer help, a listening ear or to forget that it ever happened.	0
What's your go to 'getting over a break up' starter pack?	Going on lots of dates. Not to look for a new partner right away but the ego boost is always nice. Learning a new skill makes you feel like you're new life is better and more accomplished. Going on a road trip with your bff and taking a million photos to replace all the ones with your ex on social media.	* Get a massage * eat some tasty food * hit the gym * drink * flirt with other people * coma out, enjoying my whole goddamn bed to myself * wake up, be stoked I don't have to be hungover and dealing with the person's shit * do whatever I feel like (likely binge watch tv because hangover) * wake up the next day, get back to work, feel good, smash life Do not break up during the week unless maybe it's a Thursday. Ideally do it Friday or Saturday. Ideally also do it before bed so when you wake up you feel better; you don't want to be crying all through a day if avoidable!	0
TW: To those who've been sexually assaulted/raped, when did you feel okay again?	I’d say a year later I could mostly function in day to day life (medicated and in therapy). Got gradually better and better with healthy lifestyle changes. I got into a good relationship which has been healing for me. Now at 6ish years later only certain things (images, smells) trigger me.	The next day. I'm not going to lie, it pissed me off in the moment but when it was over it was over. I have never been able to wrap my head around allowing something like that to cause so much trauma. It's a moment in time and when it is over it's gone. Why let what amounts to a few moments in time ruin any more of your life?	1
Have you ever been told you couldn’t do something simply because you were a woman?	Not really, if you don't count mundane stuff like "don't fight with boys, you're a girl" or "don't climb trees you are a girl" or "weightlifting isn't for women they should do fitness". Not that it ever stopped me, on the contrary, I used to be a kid who would intentionally do anything somebody told me not to do, even if I didn't really want to do it in the first place. This behaviour backfired more than once, of course. So I don't really see any problem with sexist remarks like "women can't do this and that". Feminists say it discourages women, but I think it may discourage some, but will encourage many more.	I was sent to a fundamentalist Jesus camp when I was 12 (it was a mistake). The first night there we were told girls weren’t allowed to: swim, ride the horses, sit next to the boys, wear tampons, take birth control, hug each other for too long, cut our hair too short, wear “boy clothes” like hoodies, or disagree with our fathers and brothers. Camp went very well.	0
Women who have shaved their head completely bald. How was it? Do you regret it? Is it exciting? Terrifying?	I never did, but I lost my hair from chemotherapy for cancer. I was very attached to my hair before (long and thick) but I felt beautiful bald. I never expected it. I was almost sad when my hair grew back.	As a 60+ male, whose been shaved (that way I can tell people: I'm shaved, not bald) since my mid-30's, all I can say is that it ALL depends on the shape of your skull (male or female) as to how well you can pull of the look. Men tend to have squarer skulls and sometimes shaved doesn't look right for them. Women, on average, have more oval shaped skulls, and the shaved look actually looks good on them. I personally find women with shaved or very short hair attractive.	1
Seriously missing my ex lately. Can I hear your stories about how you met someone ever better than an ex you thought you'd never get over?	My husband and I broke up for 5 months when we were 7 months into our relationship. I was upset and we didn't talk until months later. I was determined not to get back together with him because he's the one that broke up with me and now 4 years later were as happy as can be and married with 2 dogs and a cat.	I'm sorry that I don't have any advice. I'm in the same situation and I'm still feeling hurt and abandoned. In my mind, it will just take time. I keep myself busy with work and spending time with friends. Having a support system is essential however, I understand that the pain is still there. Stay positive, we will get through this.	0
What is the stupidest mistake you have made while cooking?	I once tipped *all* (and I mean all) the spaghetti I'd cooked for a dinner party into a sink of dirty dish water when I was trying to drain it. Fuck it, I clawed it out with my bare hands, rinsed it under some boiling water and served it anyway. I figure, it's not as bad as the time I probably served up broken glass in a lamb tagine, to four people. Hmm. Maybe should have told that story.	unsure if this counts... i'd heard of using vinegar to do a clean cycle on the coffee machine. having never used vinegar to clean before, i did this with balsamic. which meant i had to do like 4 more water cycles to get the balsamic vinegar taste under control.	0
Do you have a 3DS? What are you playing at the moment?	I just got back into Animal Crossing. My 6 year old totally fucked up my town, so I've been spending time weeding and digging up all the shit she buried lol.	I have the limited edition Zelda 3DS XL. Not the Majora's Mask one, although my boyfriend has that one and ours look so super cool next to each other. But I often joke that I have 3 children, my 2 dogs and my 3DS because I treasure it so. Lately I've also been playing New Leaf and Majora. But I also love Smash for the DS, it allows me to be introverted and still enjoy smash bros. Lately I'm into playing old games on my DS though, awhile ago I downloaded all the classic Zelda games from the Eshop for cheap and I'm finally getting to play through them now, so much classic gaming awesomeness.	1
At what point in a relationship/what age would you let your daughter start birth control?	I would prefer she use condoms. Birth control pills have a lot of terrible side effects. If She insisted she wanted the pill 15.	Whenever they needed/wanted it. If my kid trusts me enough to come to me with that, I'm not going to say no. Teenagers are going to have sex whether or not you want them to so I might as well let them be as safe as possible.	0
Have you had a friend/family member/partner who was a narcissist? How have you handled those relationships?	Brother, ex-husband, and one of my sons all narcs. You can never win with them. It is best to limit contact or eliminate it all together if you can. Very toxic energy. They will pull you down with them by intentionally starting fights, gas-lighting situations, and making you feel worthless. No one can help them, not even themselves because they don't believe they are ever wrong.	Nobody in my inner circle, thankfully, but broadly? Of course. Who hasn't? I've just learned to stay far away. The thing narcissists hate most is someone who won't buy into their bullshit. When dealing with narcissists, I usually just say things like, "Oh, how great for you!" or "Well, isn't that a nice bit of news?" in a way that makes it clear I'm being polite rather than truly impressed. I swear, *nothing* drives narcissists away more effectively than not giving them an audience to primp and preen before.	0
What's a telltale signs that a male character is written by a woman and female character is written by a man?	An English teacher of mine pointed this one out. Men describe women using fruit (cherry lips, pear shaped hips, apples in cheeks, etc.) Once she pointed this out I cringe every time I read a fruit-based description of a woman.	As a guy, sorry if I'm not suppose to reply but I feel its relevant. I don't read much but listened to goldfinch and hunger games. It felt like the males we written by females because of the way they think so emotionally and with detail. Maybe its just my mind but i feel guys should be written more instinct or reason. It been a while since so take my opinion with a grain of salt.	1
How comfortable are you with your breast size?	I have bitty boobies. I am 89% comfortable with them. LOTS of benefits - most bras work, can sleep and run comfortably, less unwanted staring, clothes fit and are mostly flattering. I wish they were a teensy bit bigger, all things equal, but I'm otherwise content	This is a really interesting question. Coming from a guy that likes boobs, confidence plays a huge part in how they're received. Size isn't everything. Rock what you have.	1
Hypothetical question: Would you leave your significant other for someone who was a better fit for you?	No because the genie would be lying. Even if it was true, I made a commitment and I love my husband. No way a hypothetical 'better' person would make me happier	i don't believe in "trading up" people. part of relationships are the legacies you build, the times you spend together. sure, there might be someone out there who loves YA novels as much as i do, loves turkey sausage as much as i do, and wants nothing more than to live in a cabin in the woods. but that doesn't mean i would want to be with that person instead of the person i'm with. so, no. and i am 27.	0
would you be freaked out if a guy told you he fell in love after one date?	If they're still together in a year, then he can tell her "I knew I loved you after our first date". If he tells her now, they won't make it to a year.	>would you be freaked out if a guy told you he fell in love after one date? One date with whom?	1
How many of you enjoy snuggling after sex?	We get up to clean ourselves off, use the bathroom, put the bed back where it's supposed to be (it's on wheels and our floor is slightly angled so we often end up a foot away from the wall), fix the sheets, have a drink of water, etc... Then cuddle.	We like to cuddle immediately after sex for a little while, then I wipe the cum up, and then we go back to cuddling! EDIT: I've been racking my brain trying to figure out how this could have possibly upset anyone, let alone two people. Explanation, please?	1
What are some lesbian-specific red/green flags?	Doesn't wear deodorant. Bras don't fit. Vagina smells bad. Super bad dental health. Any hygiene issue like that is usually an indicator of poor self-esteem or problems with money. I like a woman who takes care of herself.	Red flags: - Lesbians who don't like bi girls (ETA: and bi/pan girls who don't like lesbians or are afraid to be percieved as fully lesbian!) - Lesbians who can't be friends with straight people or gay men - Lesbians too focused on the gold star standard - Lesbians who say they're the 'man' or the 'woman' in the relationship. Especially lesbians who are trying to prove they're so macho that it's like a guy who's overcompensating by acting too 'manly', it's not their natural personality. Obviously it's cool if it's your actual personality. - Pillow princesses - Every ex is a friend, every friend is an ex. It's really notably present in the lesbian community. When I was dating, I tended to stay away from that clusterfuck as it always turned out badly for my best friend - Isn't out	0
[NSFW] What is the most disgusting thing you have ever seen?	I was sitting across from a guy in the bus one night. He had a really nasty cough. At one point he, I shit you not, coughed up an entire handful of goo. *A handful*. Then he sat there with the goo for a while, looking around the bus. I think he was confused about what to do with the goo/looking for a place to wipe it. I guess he didn't want to wipe his handful of cough goo on something in the bus so he brought his hand to his mouth and he FUCKING ATE IT.	I can't really think of anything recently, but the other night, I fell asleep with a nature documentary still running and woke up a bit later to see my tv screen filled with maggots squirming around while the narrator discussed the life cycle of bugs. That wasn't too pleasant.	1
What class have you taken (high school or college) that you thought you would hate but ended up loving?	I took calculus my senior year of high school and expected to hate it, but it was one of the most fun classes I've ever taken. Our teacher was brilliant but batshit insane (in the best way) , the class was full of all my friends, and calculus was like solving puzzles. I loved it.	I was briefly salty about having to take a year of Latin when I was 13 (no, this was not a religious school). I **friggin** loved it. Continued all through High School. Took AP Latin. Went to college, studied Latin all through college. First job was a Latin tutor in college. It was my minor. Still love it!	1
Have you ever encountered a micro penis? What was your experience?	Yeah and it would have been okay if he hadn't announced, mid sex, that "my mum always said it's not the size of the boat, it's the motion of the ocean". He quoted his mum. In bed. JUST NO	I had sex with a guy in college with a *super small* penis. A regular sized condom was baggy on him.	1
What do you think about men having "legal abortion" rights regarding unborn child, that are beind debated about in Sweden?	You mean, legalizing being a deadbeat? No. By the time you know what to do with your dick, you know what can happen when you use it. Grow the fuck up. Bad karma to Sweden for being stupid.	I suppose it would work the best in Sweden, but in most countries (even western developed countries) single mothers are still more likely to face financial hardship and children in poverty is still a social issue. So in order for this to work there needs to be 1. a tight knit social safety net, 2. remove not only legal but also social barriers to abortion, and 3. no stigma against single unmarried mothers.	0
What were some irreversible changes that happened to your body after pregnancy?	My cervical opening is now elliptical 🤷🏼‍♀️ I have much thinking nicer hair on my head, sparse body hair bigger boobs and a ton of stretch marks. My heart feels bigger 🥰	Breast shape, nipple shape/colour, my metabolism was shot and has never recovered, obviously stretch marks, vaginal scarring from birth interventions, foot size, constant back pain, and some change in hair distribution pattern on my body.	0
What is something a ton of people brag about, but you aren't impressed with?	Drinking. How much they drink. How often they drink. All of the "crazy" stories they have from drinking that are more of an indication that they have a problem than something they should be proud of.	NOT wanting kids. This applies to Reddit especially. I fully support people not wanting to have kids, they should have that choice and there's nothing inherently worse about not having kids, BUT there's nothing inherently better either. Choosing not to have kids doesn't make you a better person, smarter or more enlightened, than someone who chose to have kids ("chose" being the operative word here, as in, someone who made a well-thought and responsible choice, rather than had kids because they didn't know birth control existed or didn't have access to it, or did it out of societal pressure).	1
What aspects of traditional gender roles do you like?	This thread just makes me cringe because of the amount of "that's sexist", "you're giving us roles based on our gender only" and generally hostile answers. To answer the question, I like wearing dresses and skirts, and being "delicate".	I enjoy chivalry (a lot of it is just basic courtesy; I do "chivalrous" things like hold the door open for men and women alike). I like being the little spoon, when my SO wants to protect me (not necessarily because I need it but because he cares and has concern for me), and the guy making the first move.	1
Have your cramps ever been so bad that while your phone is warm and charging, you put it on your abdomen and use it as a makeshift heating pad because you can't get out of bed to get a real one?	That's a good idea. If you have a cat...keep treats by the bed. If they are like mine, the minute you open the package you'll have two furry mobile heating pads at your disposal.	I use my boyfriend's hand on my abdomen. He has really warm hands, so if we're out somewhere talking and I get bad cramps I'll grab his hand and put it there, or if he sees my face in pain he'll put it there. He's a real sweetie.	1
What well-intentioned thing has gone wrong for you?	i offered someone a bag for their dog's poop because the dog pooped and the person started walking away, and she completely flipped out on me and called me a nosy c-word and some other things. how was i supposed to know she was just a lazy POS and left the house without a bag on purpose?	I bought my friend froyo and put mango on it because I thought Asians love mango...and it turned out he was allergic to it. He plucked the chunks off and ate it anyway, but he thought my reasoning was hilarious.	1
Women of reddit, what's the strangest thing a man had ever said to you on a date?	As a male reading these it makes me cringe so very hard. I've said some of the dumbest, most inappropriate shit all in the name of making a girl smile. Weird happens, it can be extreme but please remember that some of these guys are face-palming at themselves too. Either way, keep them coming!	I was briefly seeing this guy, and we went on a camping date once. While walking back to our campsite, we came across some random dude camper, and I talked to him about cheddar cheese. My date flipped his shit and yelled at me. He "asked" (in an angry, raised-voice manner) who the guy was, how I know him, and why I was talking to him. I told him I had no idea who the guy was, but that we were just talking about cheese. He insisted that I knew the guy and had slept with him in the past. Definitely the strangest thing that a dude has ever said to me on a date.	0
Have you had an ex move on really quickly after your break up? How did it make you feel?	did not care. by the time i break up with them i'm long over them. also, him moving on didn't stop him from staying in my inbox with the drunk texts. poor that.	Sure. Made me feel like he never really gave a damn in the first place. Which I guess was kind of the case, since he'd been sleeping with her for the entirety of our relationship.	0
What was it like when you first moved in with your SO/Spouse?	I tell him I'm always in honeymoon phase with him. He is wonderful. We have been together for 5 years and living together for 2. Love coming home, giving him a kiss, and relaxing together.	It was pretty amazing. It was like we were both competing to be the best roommate. I'd bake stuff, he'd clean extra things, I'd do his chores and he'd snuggle me for ages. We kind of figured out things as we went along and never had any issues. When the newness wore off, we just kind of settled into a rhythm. But we still did and do all the nice things for each other.	0
Women who were in cults or had/have family members in cults, how did you and/or your family members escape? Or if they are still in one how do you deal with them being in the cult still?	One of my Aunties has two children by David Koresh of WACO fame. The big reason I remember her giving was when she got so severely scolded for taking Sky to the hospital for a broken arm, because now he was in the system. This combined with his encouraging them to violence and suicide in the case of an attack, led her to run away home with the boys before the whole thing went down.	A lot of people dont believe that Mormonism is a cult. It is. I was a part of it. I have snuck away, under the radar, but my family doesn't know. I lie about most aspects of my life to my family. It is ridiculously hard. I hope someday to be able to tell then, but for now, the cons outweigh the pros.	1
What is something you ladies of reddit need to get off your chest?	I'm hung up on a guy and I'm mad at myself for letting this happen. We were coworkers/friends for several months and once I changed jobs we started hanging out more (restaurants, bowling, etc). But recently he's been pretty curt with our conversation. This past weekend it took him more than a day to respond to my question "how was the movie?" And all he said was "it was good." At that point the message was clear. So I'm going to stop initiating contact. It sucks because I really like this guy, but at least we don't work together anymore.	One of my professors has a dry mouth and makes those annoying smacking sounds that people who don't hydrate make when they speak. I don't wanna judge him because we all have our own battles and he might be going through something (some meds give you dry mouth) but its like nails on a chalk board for me. Also, like the only girl in my class who's prettier than me sits next to me and I cant even hate her because she's super nice and we have a lot in common and actually we're kind of becoming friends. Damn it. She brought me starbucks today because she's so nice. This is far from my worst problem in life, just the one I feel like complaining about.	1
What are some weird things that you and your SO do together?	We dance during the opening song of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Every. Single. Time. If one of us isn't dancing, we call the other out. We don't dance for other TV shows. Just that one.	We both watch a YouTuber called Markiplier. If you don't know who he is, he's a gaming guy and he's hilarious. In one of his videos playing a horror game he loudly says "SQUEEEAAAK" when the door opens. So since seeing that, whenever we say goodbye on the phone or whatever we say "squuueeeaak" like markiplier. It's our way of saying how much we care about each other. Don't know why we chose that quote of all things, makes me laugh every time.	1
Do you try to book your events / vacations based on what your menstrual cycle is?	I don’t necessarily book things around it but I always check when I’m going to have it when I find out the date of something. I just like to be prepared.	nope. but when i was with my boyfriend, now ex, we would only see each other on the weekends. i take birth control and i worked it out so that there would never be a weekend where i was on my period, for the obvious reason	1
Have you ever broken up with someone who took it very hard? Did you finally forgive yourself? Why or why not?	I see no reason anyone should ever feel guilty or need forgiven for breaking up with someone. If someone doesn't take being broken up with, that's their own failure, not the fault of the person breaking up with them.	My most recent ex tried overdosing many times over my break up with her. She thought I was the "one". Meanwhile I wanted out because she repeatedly sexually assaulted me. I felt guilty at first once I heard of the suicide attempts, but through therapy I realized that she was only further trying to hurt me via manipulation. I don't feel guilty about breaking up with her now. I only feel guilty that I let her do what she did to me. Still working through that. Only a month removed from it.	0
Ladies who have had a son, has having a son changed the way you view males? If so, in what ways?	I'm the mom of 3 glorious boys. I never wanted children, and then wanted girls. Being the mom of sons has made me realize, one of the most important things a woman can do in this life, is to raise a man. My boys are the majority-white males. Raising men who are feminists in their own right, who adore and respect women as their equals, and who will stand for what is right is an important task.	No, but having a brother had probably the biggest effect on my life and maturity. In general, men are just as complex and emotional as women, and anyone who disagrees is near-sighted.	0
Is it common for girls/women to do all these things without liking you as anything more than a friend?	How old are you? From your post I'd guess high school, first year of college at the oldest. To me it sounds like this friend of yours is just enjoying your male attention and doesn't want more than that from you for whatever reason. It's a maturity thing most likely. All women are different, so of course you can't generalize and say they'll all be attention-hungry. Since she's rejected you, it's now up to you if you're going to continue hanging out with her or find a girl that wants you for more than a headrest.	You're not supposed to TELL her how you feel, you're just supposed to SHOW her how you feel by escalating (slowly). If she puts your hand on her leg, start rubbing, etc. ..	1
Ladies, how do you feel if you catch one of your male friends sneaking a peek at your goods?	It would annoy me. I have plenty of interactions with men in my life where I don't feel like I'm being sexualized all the time. So, why would I spend time with someone who would make me feel like a piece of meat? I mean, I get it, people find one another attractive. It's human nature. But there comes a time where I do expect the people I value in my life to put away childish boners and start seeing me like a real person. That constant and pervasive sexualization throughout the course of a friendship would bother me almost as much as if I had to interact with someone who called me a "girl" all the time.	I personally think it's completely normal. I have found that guys notice these things regardless of if they have interest in your or not. It doesn't offend me in the least. I think it's just a normal, natural part of life.	0
What is the best drugstore beauty product you've purchased?	Milani lipsticks are my all time favorite. They have three lines (Color Statement, Moisture Matte, Amore Matte Lip Creme) and I love all of them. The staying power and shade range is something I'd expect from a much higher end brand. I'm also super impressed by the Color Icon Blushes by Wet n Wild. I don't think I'll ever hit pan on the one I have. It's so pigmented that I barely have to tap my brush on it to get enough product.	My sister once bought this face cleanser with sulfur from Germany (I think) that was *amazing!* I've never seen it since :(	1
What do you eat for breakfast that keeps you feeling full until lunchtime?	I eat a steak, maybe yogurt and maybe veggies as well as coffee. It keeps me full till breakfast the next day. I also only eat once a day	Breakfast burritos made and frozen ahead of time. Pop in the microwave for 2 mins and I can scarf it down in no time. Made with scrambled eggs, salsa and cheese wrapped in a tortilla. Then a giant cup of coffee when I get to work.	0
Have you ever had a bad gut feeling about someone? Was your gut right?	I'd always thought one of my childhood friends' father was scary and didn't like seeing him, much less speaking with him. We carpooled though, so it was unavoidable. Turns out he's violent and a fucking child molester and he's currently serving 15 or 20 years in prison for aggravated assault resulting in a serious bodily injury.	My intuition is always on point. There are just some people I don't trust or feel bad vibes from. My friends are quick to call me judgmental until they realize that I'm always right.	1
How significant is a males scent to you? What's the deal with the "musky" smell?	I don't have the study on hand, but a male's scent has a lot to do with attraction. The example in the report given was that women who are in the dating scene are normally on some type of birth control so that messes with their hormones. They end up finding a guy, getting married, and then decide to have a baby so she goes off the birthcontrol. All of a sudden this guy who she has spent a long time with is just gross smelling to her. Neither one of them changed, it is just her hormones are back to normal and his scent isn't doing a lot for her.	First of all, that girl is into you. Second, to answer your question a man's smell is pretty important although I don't think about it at all until I smell it. Like when my husband comes in from mowing the grass or working outside and he's all sweaty and earthy and grassy smelling - instant turn on. A man with too much cologne or many smells that don't harmonize - body spray, deodorant, dry cleaner smell on a suit - ugh. Again, that's something that isn't important until it happens	0
Married ladies who got less sexual after marriage - what happened?	For me, it had more to do with his personality. There was more responsibility...planning the wedding, having a child, owning a home. Although made by mutual decisions, I solely had to shoulder the responsibilities. It made me resentful & how could I be intimate with someone that lied to me, constantly went back on his word. It really hardened my heart and completely turned me off to sex with him.	For us I think it stems from chronic pain issues for both of us, along with the stresses of daily life. It seems like the sun, moon, stars, and planets have to align perfectly for it to happen. We are trying to work on it because we are both sexual people, but the pain makes it difficult to do most basic tasks, let alone sex. I try to push myself to do it when he lets it be known hes good to go. It has really helped because yes I could use more sleep and yes I am tired. But if im not in pain and hes not in pain, and the kid is asleep im gonna try. Right now its once every 2-3 weeks. We both want it more and are actively working on it.	1
Ladies, what is the hardest most difficult part of loving your man or being in a relationship with him?	When he's upset he closes off completely. I understand it; he likes to deal with whatever he's going through on his own, in his own time. I'm a very direct person and our methods with dealing with problems really clash. When he goes silent and distant on me I turn it all inwards and wonder if I'm doing something wrong, or get frustrated that he won't confide in me. Ultimately how I deal with it is force myself to think from his perspective and leave him be when he needs it. It's painfully against my nature to do so, but I try my best.	When you say "difficult to love" in my mind it implies that the love is conditional. If it were difficult to love my man then I probably would see that as a red flag and would not be with him. Small annoyances that I do not agree with do not make it hard to love him. We all have things that our significant other doesn't specifically enjoy about us but that shouldn't test our love for them. If you are TRYING to love someone then you are being inauthentic. You shouldn't have to try.	1
Non-American women of AW, what are the "marketed beauty standards" in your area of the world?	Is this describing a 'beauty standard' or a media stereotype? My sense is that without mass media, all these countries would have a 'beauty standard' that was far closer to local ethnicity. Apart from all that, I think the white skin / blonde hair etc isn't based on stereotyped physical attractiveness - it's a shorthand for what the wealthiest human females look like, or those sought by the wealthiest males look like. If dark skin was the dominant skin type for the wealthiest on the planet, I'm pretty sure all those other countries would be darkening their skin.	Australia. You want to be thin and toned, with a deep natural looking tan and tousled (i.e lightly curled) hair that appears to have been lightened from the sun (but of course, is from the hair salon). Makeup is important and many of us are into the whole contour thing but there's a real emphasis on looking 'naturally' perfect rather than made up.	0
Ladies who have been pregnant, what's a bodily sign that made you suspicious of being pregnant besides missing your period?	I got out of the shower and my cat started licking my feet. The only other time she had ever done that was when I was pregnant before. I had not even missed my period yet. She knew before any of us!	Early pregnancy symptoms and PMS symptoms are both caused by increased levels of progesterone during the end of your cycle, so there's really very little to tell them apart. If you're pregnant enough to show symptoms, a pregnancy test will give a positive result.	1
What's the most inappropriate compliment you've received, & how'd you react to it?	Had a man open my car door in a parking lot to tell me I was beautiful and ask if I had a boyfriend. I said I had a girlfriend. He said I was too pretty to be a lesbian, and I was wearing a dress and lesbians wear pants. Top two in less than three minutes.	Women commenting on my breasts all the time no matter the context. Show someone a video of something beautiful on vacation that deeply moved me and they can only speak of the 2 second flash of my cleavage as I walk into frame. Proud of an art piece I told them I worked two years on? They laugh that they got distracted by my boobs as I gestured to it. In formal dress for the first time around them, having never seen me with makeup or my hair done? Boobs look great. Paired with grabbing them. I generally say something honest. "I wanted to show you where we spread my boyfriend's father's ashes as it was beautiful and I feel entirely disrespected by you." And going forward I remove them from my life beyond 'smile as we pass' acquaintances. The fact this was* being down voted speaks volumes heh.	1
Fellow women who've had their drinks spiked, what does it feel like and what are some warning signs?	No warning signs from what I remember. One moment I'm fine dancing with this guy and some friends, the next moment I'm throwing up in an Uber with people I don't know. Then, the next morning, I wake up with a bunch of people around me and I have no idea who they are or where I am. Lucky for me, they were a group of people who stopped this guy from taking me out of the bar, but it could've ended up way worse.	Not a woman but feel this belongs here. This was a long time ago(22yrs) my very pretty ex and I went to a house party. I had 2 beers and a mixed drink someone made me. We were no stranger to strong drink, so 3 drinks was nothing. One minute all was well.. The next I couldn't not keep my head up. Woke up next to the couch hours later with my head pounding and absolutely no memory. I guess they wanted the boyfriend out of the picture. I've told this to people over the years and they all say maybe your memory just got scrambled. You probably had more than 3 drinks. Just sayin it happens to guys too.	1
What may be some things you girls see as sexist, while we, men, may not be realising it is?	As an example, I was waiting in line (for over an hour) to exchange a cable box a few weeks ago. I was holding the cable box under one arm, and was told about _three_ times by different men that I should put it down so it didn't get heavy for me. Not one of those men felt the need to tell men who were holding the exact same cable box that they should do the same. I had to keep telling them I was fine holding it. I mean, the thing weighed like, a whopping 7 pounds. I think things like this happen a lot without people thinking twice about it. Also, assuming that a woman is not legitimately upset about something and automatically blaming her "attitude" on PMS.	ITT: Everything a man does that a woman doesn't like is sexist... Bullshit. I'm a woman and to be quite honest, some of these suggestions of sexism are hilarious. Oh a guy offers help with something he thinks is heavy = sexist. Someone calls a woman a girl = sexist. No wonder some men get confused.	1
Women who have been raped by women, how has your life been affected?	I was molested by other girls my age when I was about 9. They undressed me on school grounds and took pictures of me with their phones. None of them were being molested (this was a group of about 15 girls), just did it out of pure hate because I was "the weird girl" and also had breasts when none of them had them yet. The same girls then made me strip and dance for them and molested me during a sleepover, then beat me up. I was kicked out of that sleepover *for being naked and beaten up*. It made me distrust girls my age for the longest time, especially girls with their same features for some reason.	I'm a trans woman and I was assaulted by a young woman when I was 14. I saw a comment on here that talked about having trouble calling it rape and I struggle with that too because what I remember doesn't feel that bad but at the same time there are entire hours from that night I don't think I'll ever remember. The part that fucked me up the most is that, because I hadn't come out as a woman yet, everyone thought that the 14 year old "boy" must have initiated it and I got blamed for the sexual contact. My parents apologized on my behalf. I got grounded etc. The literal definition of blaming the victim. Still believe it was my fault. Oddly enough, I'm more scared of men than women so her gender hasn't really affected me that much.	1
Following on from the “Why don’t you get a man to do that” thread, what was your worst experience of being told “You’re a woman so you should do that”?	Any time there's a baby that needs holding. No thanks man, I'll pass unless I'm the only one there to help.	One times my ex's dad got mad at him cause I was carrying my laundry downstairs... And apparently he should be doing it for me... I didn't know I was so weak..	1
What little thing has your SO done for you lately that has made you melt?	My SO works on Saturdays so he gets up before me. He had been up for about an hour and I was still in bed but awake. He came into the room, and I felt him pull the covers over me so that my whole shoulder was covered. It was such a small gesture but I really appreciated him checking up on me whilst he thought I was sleeping.	She stood back and lovingly laughed and made funny faces when I was talking to a Bernie Sanders supporter asking if I wanted him to "educate me"* on Bernie Sanders' political positions. And she hugged me after. I'm a pretty simple girl like that. *His words	1
Women who were, or whose parents forced you to be, part of the purity movement, how has it affected you today?	Wasn't part of any "purity movement" or anything but definitely raised with a sexual morality of self-respect and an emphasis on commitment. My sexual relationships have been meaningful and long lasting. I have never had any STDs or abortions unlike some friends of mine. I have friends who's parents really didn't care what they did and some of them have had over 30 sex partners, abortions, contracted herpes and been pumped and dumped which made them feel like shit. All in all I think I've had a much better outcome than they have.	I was pushed into it by both my (public) school and my church, but my parents weren't 100% committed to it and didn't push it. They weren't even aware of what the school was doing. I basically paid lip service to the trend as needed to avoid being singled out, ostracized, or bullied, but never bought it, thanks in large part to having internet access during my teen years.	0
When was a time when you embarrassed yourself so badly that you just wanted to crawl in a hole and die?	Back in 11th grade, a classmate (let's call him P) used to sit next to me. P was a nerdy and quiet kid who looks like any other weirdo but he was savage with his words. I had a runny nose that day. So i sneeze really hard and a huge watery drop comes out of my nose. I wipe it with my hankey in a microsecond but then i see P looking at me with a poker face. I tell myself he didn't notice anything but whenever i we used to cross paths, he always pretended to ask his friends in front of me if they have cold or cough. This went on for a few days... And all that while, my newly formed boyfriend used to share a dorm with P.	Over 10 years ago, I went over to my friend’s house for her high school graduation bbq. Let myself in the back gate, mingled a bit, and was so starving after working 12 hours that grabbed a plate before I found my her. Continue the hunt for my friend, still can’t find her, so finally just call and she says she’s in the kitchen. I’m in the kitchen. She’s not there. It clicks that I’m at the wrong damn house. I have never bolted so fast in my life!	0
What's the most silly/clueless thing you've ever seen a guy say about women here on reddit?	Actually I've wondered that myself. I realize it's not an erotic time, but when the inserter is penetrating, nothing? My wife has an orgasm (nearly) the instant I insert a finger.	Some guy once got into a serious argument with me, because he believed that women left hair ties at men's places, to stake their territory, or so that they could force a second date. And continued to hold this opinion, even after I tried to explain that they cost like .10 a piece, and forgetting them places is such a common occurrence that most women with long hair will carry at least 2 or 3 of them in their purses at all times.	0
What's the most shocking thing you've had to explain to a significant other?	My fiance didn't know you had to make a noise when kissing. He thought the little noise was just automatic.	That cats do not, in fact, like being vacuumed. Context: >Husband: "Wow, the cats are REALLY shedding a lot!" >Me [heading out the door to go to work] : "Yup, we're gonna have to vacuum them, haha!" (Later, I return from work. Husband is COVERED in claw marks, and comes over to me wide eyes) >"Honey, the cat does NOT like being vacuumed!" ...I was speechless for a good 30 seconds before nearly busting a gut laughing. I had to explain that I was JOKING and OBVIOUSLY trying to vacuum a cat- much less trying to vacuum a cat *while holding it*- is a terrible idea! Good times, good times. lol	0
Why is your friend who is always complaining about being single single?	She relies on alcohol to get through every first date because she's so nervous and anxious that she needs to hide the real her. She's obsessed with finding a boyfriend but also fixates on relatively minor details as reasons why the current dude is incompatible. She has very little in the way of interests and hobbies--most of her free time is consumed by dating. She is deeply self-conscious and insecure in a manner which is neither cute nor endearing.	She's so afraid of not having a relationship work out, she'd rather avoid relationships entirely. A giant portion of her personality is that she's good at everything - great at her job, a loving sister and aunt, a tenacious fighter for justice, a reliable community volunteer - and having a relationship fail would ruin the image she has of herself. She never goes on dates, and in fact will actively avoid activities that might introduce her to other singles. Her life is full of love and friendship and family, but she's open about being jealous of her married friends.	0
How do you feel about the phrase, "women understand women and don't like women"?	Sadly spot on in many cases. I have said it before and I’ll say it again nobody hurts and tears women down and is as good at doing it as other women. We should be lifting each other up and encouraging each other not seeking how to hurt each other the worst. Sadly one of my worst favorite “groups” tends to be women. I’m trying to correct that because I know some amazing women and I’m a woman myself but women my age and I do not vibe well and when we do something stupid eventually happens.	Never heard it and don’t agree. I’m a woman and I love women and men. Only insecure women don’t like other women.	0
Women who don’t talk to their siblings anymore, what’s the story?	She is so happy that I feel if I call/contact her I will ruin her happiness... My awesome sister 😟	He’s the oldest of 5, I’m the youngest (15 years apart). Rough childhoods, had to be on welfare, we were living at the YWCA when I was born, dad is also super shitty person. My super republican brother, during a text argument because I posted something on FB about how most people on welfare don’t want to be and actively try to get off (like our mother), he thought I should know that I was a product of rape via our father, not wanted, our mother shouldn’t have had me (but abortion is bad?), and his life would have been better had I not been more because he would have had more than 1 pair of jeans to wear to school and wouldn’t have been made fun of because of it. He has 2 boys now, 10 and 12, who are both severely mentally unwell because of his parenting style.	0
Hopeless romantics: what stranger do you see regularly and have a secret crush on?	There's a guy at my climbing gym who I see around and refer to in my head as my boyfriend, e.g. "Oh look my boyfriend's here." I'm currently trying to seduce him by walking past him all the time but not making eye contact.	I don't generally crush on strangers just in case I see them on the news or in the paper for something abhorrent. Saves me the heartache.	1
What is your worst story of "good person" is actually trash in a relationship?	My bf - or now ex as of an hour ago - is the most liked person everywhere. He seems like such a good person on the surface. So kind and caring. All he cares about is himself and not feeling bad though. He just broke up with me after booking a holiday to go meet his mum in France. After postponing us moving in together bc he wasn't ready yet but definitely wanted to. We were going to Japan for Christmas. I met all of his family last Christmas 6 months into dating. I'm sorry, I'm very distressed rn	I had this friend, her husband was abusive, but nobody believe her at first because in public he was this amazing guy everyone was crazy about him, It took a trip to the emergency room with all her ribs broken to people realize it was an act, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw her there he destroyed her face, he had the guts to say that she threw herself down stairs to blame him . The officer who arrested him said: oh really? how many times she did it.	0
I see it all the time on r/askmen but are there girls out there who have been completely oblivious to signs of interests from guys?	Definitely. But when I look back on it now, I think it's often been with Nice Guys™. You know, the ones who do their best to ingratiate themselves to you *just as friends*, and eventually get pissed off with you when you don't fall into their arms once you've magically realised that they've been *there for you all this time* while other guys are just assholes. The problem is that they intentionally presented themselves as 'just a friend' to me. The point when I realised they were interested was usually when they eventually got pissed off that I wasn't dating them yet.	It's not so much that I'm oblivious, but I don't trust that men are actually interested in me unless they both directly say they are AND act in a way that makes their interest obvious. I have a little bit of an ugly duckling complex, and even though I think that objectively I'm not bad-looking and I'm a fun person to be around, I'm pretty insecure about guys putting me in either the just friends or just sex buddies category because I'm not pretty enough or interesting enough to hold their interest long-term. Which means that unless a man outright says "I want to date you" and then plans a date, I assume he's just interested in friendship or casual sex.	0
Who are terrible feminists and why?	I'm not a fan of the current liberal feminist trend where anything and everything a woman does is supposedly feminist and non-problematic as long as a woman says she chooses it. Other than that, I'd consider terrible feminists people who are hypocrites, who espouse equality but don't carry it out in their private lives and act out roles or support institutions or ideas that are fundamentally unequal.	The ones that say you can't be feminist and Zionist. Of course I can. Jews have the right to self-determination and it's bigoted to say otherwise. You can't be feminist and anti-Semitic. That's not intersectional.	1
What's your "holy grail" question that you always ask on a first date?	If marriage is something they want in their future. I don't flat out ask it, but I somehow work it into the conversation. It's not because I want to get married right away to the first guy who says yes. I've just already made the mistake of sticking around for someone who wasn't sure until it was too late to not be devastated by our different life goals.	"Why do you think we would be good together?" I'm also all about the intense interview style first date. Reddit has informed me this is a terrible approach, but it worked out well for me when dating.	1
What is that obscure (or not) topic you know a lot about but don't talk about because no one has ever brought it up or asked about it? What are you DYING to tell someone?	Every other person I meet is happy to talk about old Nintendo games, but no one ever wants to talk about old Sega games with me.	I know a lot about Latin. I'm extremely proficient (I don't say fluent because Latin is read/written and not really spoken) because I have studied it since I was 13 plus all through college. I do some now in my spare time, just translations and such. I have a lot of books. I know all of the grammar. I see a lot of words with Latin roots and I think about Latin on a daily basis but I keep it to myself because bringing it up sounds really pretentious and most people find it boring. Oh, and NOBODY brings up Latin. But I'll have you know that the second that someone does (happens, I don't know, maybe a few times a year), my ears will prick up and I will run over and knock over people to contribute.	0
What petty thing do you need to rant about right now?	Alot of "womens safe spaces" I find are "women who fit our ideas of what women should think safe spaces" ive been insulted both after revaling my gender and while getting called a stereotype of the type of man they think disagrees with them. Theese are ironicly Also riddled with claims of how this is where women can escape societies ideals and be themself.	So both my partner and I were on vacation this last week and because we have pets we trusted a friend to watch after them while we were gone. I left detailed notes for everything they needed and left my apartment clean. (I love the feeling of coming home to a clean home.) My boyfriend came home before I did and so I woke up this morning to snaps and text of our apartment.. pee and poop everywhere, food left out on the counter, an ice tray in the fridge, xbox controllers out, pet food open and on its side, and jackets belonging to the pet sitter and his girlfriend. 😡😡😡 All I asked was him to come over and feed them, not to come over to chill, play Xbox and leave my place a mess!!!	0
Do any of you also experience a female "refractory period"?	I have different parts down there, but once I get off I'm done and dont' want anything to continue. Then I will nap.	If I orgasm from clitoral stimulation, then my clit CANNOT be touched if we are going into PIV. I don't enjoy PIV as much afterward because my clitoral orgasms are REALLY intense and my come down time can last 5-10mins. I have a hard time focusing on whats happening right afterwards.	0
What is the one thing you wish your SO had never asked you?	What my password to my computer was. If I gave it to him I would lose my privacy. If I didn't give it to him then he would think I don't trust him. I trusted him enough to give it to him. Well, I ended up losing my privacy when he went snooping around my computer and he still lost my trust.	I'm not a woman but I think the question of "how many" and "who have you" slept with should never be said. As a dude I never ask these questions. It's none of my business and I think it's personal.	1
Redditors who have been happily married for 10 + years: What do you and your partner do to stay so happy and stable in your relationship for so long?	Give each other plenty of space, and even MORE respect. NEVER take your partner for granted, and as a man, I defer to my spouse on all family matters except the finances (I pay for everything) which I control. Also, never fail to show affection and attention in every way possible. Holding hands when out and about, holding the door for her, following the "ladies first" rule, and simple common courteousy to each other.	Understand that the "In love" feeling comes and goes. Sometimes it is important to be committed to the Relationship because your feelings for the person can change at times, life stressors change. Source: married 33 years.	0
Women who started their relationship as "the other woman"- does it ever cross your mind that your partner will find another "other woman" when committed to you? How do you stop your mind from wandering?	I started out my last relationship as the other woman and the trust that I had for him was so low from the start. We were with each other all the time and constantly keeping tabs on one another when we weren't together. I made no time for my friends and isolated myself from everything. I went from being confident and happy to embarrassingly insecure in myself and my relationship. So if you're thinking about it, just don't do it. There's so many other people out there and you should absolutely consider starting a relationship where you can trust the other person entirely because how it all started will always be in the back of your head.	I'm a man. This is the original starting reason that I've always been alone, still, at 33. I didn't want to ask a girl out if I felt there might be a chance that I would meet someone better while with her, and have to betray her in order to leave, and the other girl would know, and so how would she ever trust me? This, along with awkwardness, led me to never having had a girlfriend by my mid twenties, and after about that time, no woman wants a man that has no relationship experience, and so I missed my window. There are other things wrong with me too that I've tried to fix, but it's really too late now.	1
What is the dumbest item you've heard a man say they don't like women wearing?	>extremely ridiculous Cosmo article* about how wearing a black hair tie around the wrist is RUINING OUR OUTFITS, I read that article, and it wasn't that ridiculous. It was about appearing more polished, and they're right, you'll look more polished and put together if you're not wearing a hair tie around your wrist.	I read a thread on a different sub once where the complaint was about maxi dresses/skirts and how they hide half the body (i.e the legs). Ugh.	0
Do any of you have no/little sense of smell? How does it affect your life?	I have almost no sense of smell and my roommate and I got into a huge fight last week because apparently my cat was peeing everywhere and I had no idea. My roommate is very quiet and didn't say anything until it got bad enough for her to move out. I rarely have guests and no one has ever said anything. I'm not sure how to clean this up without just hiring someone because I still cannot locate the source of the smell. I've never been more embarrassed. :(	I love spices and can smell strong scents and a few smaller things like raim, but general stuff I can't smell. I generally will ask my boyfriend to smell check things that aren't obviously molding. Esstienally if I really want to smell, I need to shove in my nose It sucks but I can't smell most shitty things either, like New York City or Boston.	1
Are you okay with your bf/SO following very sexual models on instagram/snapchat?	It bothers me because it's public. I don't have to ever know when he's watching porn and it usually ends once the action is done. Whereas Instagram/snapchat is something people interact with a lot and it now carries into your every day life. Plus the accounts you follow on Instagram are public so now I see what you're bombarding yourself with when you're always on Instagram. Like must you constantly have to look at sexualized women?	Im male and have nothing to contribute answer-wise, but i have a question, mostly aimed towards the women that are bothered by this idea. is being subscribed to lots of nsfw subreddits the same thing in your mind? If not what makes it different?	1
What are some things that are sexually biased that people don't talk about?	The Smurfette Principle is something that shows up in a lot of shows and movies. Basically, if there's a group of characters, they all have their "thing"-- someone's the smart one, someone's the funny one, etc. The lone female character is the girl one. The boys are individuals, and the girl is just not a boy.	Women have more earth-shattering orgasms and it's fucking not fair. It's not fair fucking either. What do we want, female orgasms, when do we want them Now!	1
Women who grew up being told to always forgive and be nice even to hurtful people, how long did it take you to develop a backbone and healthy boundaries as an adult? Was the transition period awkward?	I’m still transitioning tbh. In asian cultures we’re taught to “not make a scene” or “just be the bigger person.” I also think that because of this it really strengthened my patience in people but you come to point you realize that you’re pretty much getting taken advantaged of knowing that you probably won’t say a thing.	I've always had a backbone. I was taught to "be better" than the people that hurt me. A common phrase my mother and grandmother told us growing up was something along the lines of "forgive everyone, but do not, under any circumstances, forget what they did or how it made you feel".	1
How often should you really shower?	As often as you need/want to. Some people get dry skin if they shower too much, while other people are perfectly fine showering twice a day. Some people like to wash their hair every time they shower, while other people only wash their hair once a week or less. There's no right or wrong way to do it, as long as you don't stink.	LOL the no-shower, no-shampoo movement trending lately is one of my biggest pet peeves! Everyone has a different activity level and some live in warmer climates with more humidity, which just necessitates more frequent showering, period. I work out in the morning (HIIT) and take a full shower before work, and usually will rinse just my body before bed to freshen up. It annoys me so much when people gasp and say “omg washing your hair every day is soooo bad for it!!” when they’re the usually the ones who flat iron daily and color their hair, while I never color or heat style mine. You go ahead and fry your hair and feel better about it by showering once a week if you want, just leave my healthy, soft, nice smelling hair and skin alone, thanks.	1
What is your favorite Studio Ghibli movie?	Ghost of fireflies, spirited away and paprika. I thought the sibling situation during the war was pretty sad but I also remember the music they played during the movie too as a kid. Spirited away felt like a lot of fun to watch it gave me more hope for the better and paprika just felt very magical and colorful. I liked the while dream sequence of it.	Spirited Away! I have 2 tattoos of No Face (one is holding Gudetama lmao) and aim to fill my legs with ghibli and other animated icons Edit: The reason why is when I was little I watched the full film in Japanese and didnt understand a word but felt connected to the film the entire way through. I remember the exact feeling and smell of the evening, and when I saw the first spirit boat arrive I had never felt so captivated on a sensory level by a film before.	0
Ladies of Reddit. "I'm not high maintenance, you're just low effort" is a popular phrase currently. How would you describe high maintenance/low effort? What qualities would you say describes both?	High maintenance is a way for people to minimise women's needs and a way to criticize women for expressing needs.	Perspective. Being high maintenance means you require a lot of maintenance from other people. Anyone of any gender can be high maintenance. It is most often used with a misogynist overlay of "woman who takes excellent care of herself and has high expectations for luxuries in her life." The idea is that you expect more than the average partner. Being low effort means that you don't expend a lot of energy to anyone outside yourself. Anyone of any gender can be low effort. The idea is that you offer less than the average partner.	0
Ladies with periods, what's your most embarrassing period story?	In middle school, I was still learning how to deal with it. One day in class, I knew my pad had overflooded with blood. I got up to ask the teacher if I could use the restroom, which she said yes. I went back to my desk to grab my purse (pads inside) and saw a blood smear on my chair. Yikes. Lucky for me it was the 90s and a flannel tied around your waist did not stand out. Later my friend told me that I had a huge blood mark on the back of my jeans, and that no one said anything because they were all embarrassed. Ah, middle school.	Standing up at work to greet a customer and having a MASSIVE blood clot work its way past my tampon and blorp out on the floor. ... Thankfully I was behind a desk she couldn't see past and I was wearing a floor length skirt and I work alone in the shop. She went into a change room right away (I alter clothes) so I quickly ran to the back and did a warp speed tampon change. I had to leave the mess behind my desk until she was gone though. She never knew what happened, but I still felt really embarrassed.	1
I was supposed to buy professional clothing, but I ended up buying another cute print dress instead...AskWomen, where do you guys get your work clothing?	I really like NY&CO for basic business attire, and I find a lot of good stuff at Nordstrom's Rack, Marshall's and TJ Max. The professional women I work with love to find stuff at Steinmart. Yet for daily work wear I gravitate towards print dresses, cardigans, and ballet flats... And my industry is super-conservative (investments/banking). I'd probably take one of my dresses and add a good tailored jacket, a good bag, and statement heels for an interview. You don't necessarily need to wear a pantsuit to look professional.	I'm kind of tomboyish. I buy khakis from Old Navy, shirts and sweaters from American Eagle, and wear a pair of nice sneakers (Vans).	1
What are you preachy about?	The whole HAES/FA movement makes me preachy because it's hypocritical, stupid, anti-feminist, and dangerous. I will definitely argue passionately against anyone who believes in that horseshit. Also dislike anti vaxxers and anyone opposed to equality.	You guys already hit the big things, so I'm gonna go with not putting your cart away in the grocery store parking lot. I yell at friends and almost got into a physical altercation once. Like, seriously, why is it so effing hard to return them to the little cart corrals?!	0
What’s the most common-knowledge thing that you’ve had to explain to your SO?	I had to explain #metoo to him last a year a good month or so after it became a thing. That was pretty shocking. He claimed he had no idea because he doesn't use Facebook anymore.....	My husband needed some eggs boiled for a science project he was teaching at school. He asked me if it was possible to boil them with the shell still on them. 🙈	0
Women who always/most of the time go braless, how did it affect your boobs? Positives/negatives?	I've been braless for several years now except with some outfits/situations. I have tiny tits so the only difference it makes for me is comfort.	My boobs are very perky and their shape is pretty great. Bras aren’t good for the ligaments, so I’ve read. (I’m a trans dude, but yeah.)	1
What’s one gender stereotype that grinds your gears?	That real men don’t cry/get sad/talk about their feelings etc etc. This mindset has ruined, and taken, so many lives.	That women are naturally inclined to be caregivers. That women just "do housework better" than men do. That women are less logical than men. That men are better with strategic decisions than women. That women will feel horrible or guilty if they work full-time when they have children. That men are incapable parents. ...I don't think I can pick one.	0
What are the unspoken things about having a baby?	When you have a new baby, you're obsessed with them. It's like you are falling in love, but even more powerful.	I knew I would still look about six months pregnant after giving birth. But what surprised me was how disgusting my stomach felt. Kind of like jello. I just avoided touching my stomach for weeks.	0
Women of Reddit, how has the stereotype of women being more “emotional” affected your life?	Slightly, but not to the point that I completely hide it. I have more control on showing my emotions but I definitely am open if I feel a certain way and let the other person know they're affecting me. If I get a response of being called too sensitive, or some other bs, I'll just tell the person to keep their distance from me. There's just certain things I'll shrug my shoulders at and other times I'll call something out. Also people usually tell me my face is very expressive, so that alone made me just say oh well whatever my face shows is what it is.	I am emotional. And I see nothing wrong with that. When I was a kid I was always told that I was too “sensitive”. But I think the message should change. Why is it wrong to feel and love deeply? To be moved to tears because of another person’s plight? To feel anger at injustice instead of turning a blind eye? By telling kids that they’re “too sensitive”, we’re raising adults who don’t care about each other. Sensitivity and compassion are beautiful. I’ve also noticed that people don’t take my emotions very seriously. Me being angry is just me “being emotional”. It belittles my problems.	0
I want to have more in-person. female friends. Where did you meet yours?	I'm in the same boat. I moved to a new city about 4 months ago, and got a new job. I am the only female in my office, and don't do too much besides go to the gym. Meeting friends has been much harder than I expected.	I mean, there are a lot of steps to take before this one becomes necessary but having kids will make you a lot of friends. Easy conversation starter too - talk about how far along you are at lamaze class and next thing you know you're out for egg-white omlettes and virgin Bloody Mary's complaining about how awful MIL is over what to call the baby. Before you take that step, though. What about an exercise class? Perfect opportunity to meet people and small-talk over how sore you are.	1
My sister dropped a pizza FACE DOWN on the ground. What petty shit will you NEVER FORGIVE someone in your life for?	[Insert hyperbolically sarcastic way of suggesting that your friend is worse than Hitler by scientific notationesque orders of magnitude here.]	My sister and I were sharing a piece of key lime pie, and it was the best damn pie I've had in my entire life. I split the last piece in two to share it fairly, but as I was lifting it to my mouth it fell off the fork and she reached over and stole my piece!!! This was over a decade ago and I'm still pissed , sometimes she brings it up to try to convince people that I was in the wrong for flipping out but they see right through it	0
We're encouraged to marry "before all the good ones are gone". In your experience, when did "all the good ones" start really going?	Lmao at 30+ women who doesn't want to realize their prime is already gone, and most good men are taken.	>In your experience, when did "all the good ones" start really going? Interestingly, "the good ones" didn't even show up until my mid-late twenties.	0
I don't like who I become in relationships, does anyone else have this problem?	Yep exactly why I left my last one. I feel like when I'm in a relationship I focus my attention 100% on them. do what they want and kinda just forget about myself. This makes me resent them and then I get mad for no reason. I've decided to just enjoy the 'me time', until I feel ready to share myself with someone.	Yes, this happens to me. I would get frustrated because I felt like I had to "be the adult" in every situation. My SO is eight years my senior, so it annoyed me to no end. However, I'm trying (and I think succeeding) at being more patient. He's had a very different, very relaxed upbringing/early adulthood. That really made a difference in how he operates in life. It's difficult, but is getting better.	1
What is the most uncomfortable situation have you ever been put in- by a guy? Any kind of unwanted flirtation- or something of that nature?	Not flirtation but definitely beyond uncomfortable. Once I was sitting on the outside patio of a coffee shop studying and an older man (50s?) came and sat at the table right next to me. I noticed him staring at me but just ignored him. Not just glances, a straight up staring. Five minutes after he sat down I noticed some fidgeting out of the corner of my eye and took a quick glance. Not only was this man still staring, he straight up starting playing with himself...in public...in broad daylight...5 feet away from me.	I once shook a hand of a male distant friend of mine during high school. He stopped and slowly felt up the palm of my hand asking me as to how do I make my hands so soft. Another male distant friend during high school (As I was wearing a bag/backpack) asked if he could put his hand on my back as we were walking like a couple without the hand dropping down to my ass. I don't entirely remember but I think it was just one of those moves to stick some shit on my back.	1
When was a time someone who considers themselves to be very open minded and tolerant proved to be exactly the opposite?	I know a ton of people in my parents’ generation who were (rich, white) lefty in the seventies and think that that gets them a free pass to be considered lefty for the rest of their lives. So, they’re super judgmental and look down on poor people and barely tolerate gay people but think they’re liberal because, like, they smoke pot and think black people should have Civil Rights.	There was this one comedian Aziz who claimed to be on women's side in public. Turns out he has some pretty rapey tendencies in private	1
What was it like growing up with hard-partying parents?	they did weed, alcohol, and meth but not much partying. on a good night, they locked themselves in their room and left us alone to make/eat dinner. on a bad night, my dad mixed the wrong shit and went on methrage rampages while my mom followed him around trying to get him to chill and urging us to not call the police. their drug dealer at the time also gave them a special price if he could play with me and my little sister. we were never hurt by him, because my dad was always nearby and would hit us if we made him too excited or made him ''think you're his girlfriend''. we were like 5 and 7.	I spent a lot of time in bars, and surrounded by people I didn’t know very well. It was a lot of chaos and uncertainty. It definitely affected me, and plays a large part in my social anxiety and fierce desire for peace and quiet the majority of the time. I love my parents a lot, and I don’t resent them for it-they were two people who had children and lacked the maturity to realize that having children means your life has to change. It is what it is.	0
Current/Former brides who lost/had to remove a bridesmaid, what happened?	We had an insanely bad falling out. I never told her she was no longer in the wedding party but left her to assume. There wasn't a date or really anything but a ring at that point. She figured it out. I'm not proud of it, it feels like a low integrity move to just ghost her. I just had no more left to give an energy vampire.	We lost our maid of honour due to a death in her family. Her cousin, which she was very close to, lost her battle with cancer the same week as our wedding. I’ll never forget when she drove over the day it happened. She got out of the truck, barely got two words out and just started bawling. She understandably went to the funeral, but she came to the reception afterwards. We were just happy that she had somewhere fun to go to after that and hopefully lift her spirits a bit.	0
Do you ever get offended by the standard of men who show interest in you?	offended when they show interest, no. offended when they actually try to pursue me as if they have a reasonable chance, absolutely.	I'm not offended by men showing interest in me, I'm offended based on HOW they show interest. I won't get upset at someone mentioning it casually, in fact I'll be flattered. However, if you catcall me on the street at 7am because you think I have a nice ass, go fall off a cliff.	0
When Did You Realize That Sexual Harassment/Sexual Assault Was Commonplace for Women?	I was 13 the first time I got catcalled. It was my 30 something neighbors making comments about my developing breasts and how that meant I was reafy to be fucked. I didn't really understand what was going on so I told my mom. My mother's face was just so resigned. Not furious, just resigned. And I knew then that I shouldn't expect it to stop anytime soon.	I've never had this happen to me before because i'm a guy but fck. Wtf is wrong with people. I would beat the crap out of anyone that ever tried to do this to my mom or sister. Reading your experiences makes me realize why girls are so cautious being alone around guys. It makes me angry to think people would do fcked up shit like harrasment & be okay with it.	1
The co-founder of Tinder is creating a "women-first" dating app where women must make the first move. What are your first impressions of this idea?	didn't this exact thing fail like a little while ago? like every woman would just send a a generic opener to a thousand guys and essentially still force the guy to make the first actual move.	I actually downloaded Bumble tonight and I hate it. It forces you to import job and education info from Facebook. I don't want a bunch of strangers immediately knowing where I work and where I go to college.	0
Women who are the reason for your and your partner's dead bedroom (DB), whats *your* side of the story?	I guess I got busy because I was studying for the bar exam and then I become a stressed out lawyer so that probably killed it and he was pretty passive and never said anything. He also gained a bunch of weight (me too) but he’s 100 lbs heavier than me and was already heavy so I’m sure he has increased estrogen or low T that I think he will finally see a doctor about. I’m super pissed off about it because I try but he honestly can’t seem to perform and he freaks out. If I thought I could cheat and get away with it I would.	He would subtly put me down throughout the day or do minor things that annoyed me like tickling, poking and prodding or make dumb loud noises. All of this happened on repeat all day every day and drove me to insanity. So naturally the sex drive died pretty quick. In a less subtle situation he would call me stupid/idiot and freak out at minor things, say he dropped a utensil while cooking or if he walked into my shoes by the doorway. It would result in me being yelled at. Don’t really want to have sex after a day full of that and I could never get it through to him that I want to feel loved and safe and not be on edge for when I’ll be yelled at next, then maybe I’d want to have sex.	0
Moms of AskWomen, how do you discipline your children? What method has been most effective?	We do not use punishment at all in my family. My children are 8, 11 and 14 and have never been punished or disciplined in any traditional sense of those words. I respect them and partner with them to solve problems that arise. I work to understand their behavior and the underlying reasons behind it and help them to manage their feelings and actions. I only say no when i have to and take their interests and desires seriously. They are all well adjusted, kind, confident and compassionate kids.	My daughter is 13. Taking away electronics as by far the most effective discipline for her. She usually throws a bossy fit for the first hour. I just keep my cool. Then the next day or two she is good as gold. I usually let her earn them back faster if she does lots of chores.	0
Women who are independent, how? What helps you keep pushing to thrive to be independent, fo fly solo?	I was just born wired this way. My brain gets a chemical rush from forging my own way, having power over myself and my life, making my own decisions, and taking my own risks. I enjoy achievement. I also don’t feel lonely. It’s just not something I experience. I have more fun when I have friends and a partner, sure. But I moved across the country by myself just before the pandemic and spent a year of quarantine living totally alone in a foreign place, not leaving my house at all. Didn’t ever feel lonely tbh. I just kept myself occupied. So I think it’s just my brain. I’m naturally happiest when I don’t have to depend on anyone, and I don’t experience the same downsides to independence that others might.	I was raised that way! My mom taught me that you can't trust everyone by their words and that people leave. So I always need to have a Plan B and C in place. Also, I'll be damned if someone ever gave me an allowance. F*** that 😁	1
What's more of a turn off? A man who dances like an idiot or a man who doesn't dance at all. What are your thoughts on the matter?	A man who dances if he feels like it, doesn't if he doesn't, and also won't pressure me to do so - I'm really self conscious about dancing, mainly because the only way I could be worse at it is if I chopped a leg off.	if someone isn't willing to put themselves out there and have a bit of fun, then it shows you the level of confidence they have. you can always improve on dancing, but if you're too scared to even try, that says a lot	1
Ladies of the medical world, what's the most odd thing you have had a patient openly admit to you?	I'm a psych nurse. I have countless stories. A fairly recent one that sticks out: I walked onto the unit to start my day and a patient approaches me and seductively says, "Good morning. Did you know I was born in a light bulb?" EDIT: spelling	I'm in labor and delivery. A patient called our triage line for contractions and, of course, was asked to come in to be evaluated. She was a prostitute and stated she was going to have to do "at least some anal" to be able to get to the hospital. She was a well known patient, so we knew she was being completely serious. Yes, these our the mothers of our generation ladies!	1
What's the worst sex advice you've ever received from a woman's magazine?	I remember reading once, in Cosmo or Glamour or something, that most men enjoy a bit of rough play when it comes to their balls, and so when giving a blowjob, biting on them might heighten his pleasure. Now, I fully understand that there are men who enjoy the kinkier side of things when it comes to their testicles, but had I ever followed that advice, I think any of the men I've ever been with would have had a fit and cowered in pain in the corner.	Look up into his eyes while going down on him. I tried it once and my husband now calls that look "the crazy eyes"	1
Women of reddit, what are some of your tips to a fellow lady who's got no game when it comes to attracting a partner?	My attractiveness varies enormously depending on how I'm dressed, and that includes makeup. I'm basing this on men's reactions to me. \-Wear makeup (eyeliner, mascara, undereye concealer, a little blush, and a subtle lipstick) \-Wear your hair down and styled. If you're a model, you might look hot in a ponytail, but I don't think most of us do. \-Wear an outfit that shows the general shape of your body, maybe with a tight waist. Nothing too baggy. You don't have to show cleavage AT ALL - and in general that's kind of a trashy look, so I'd avoid that. \-Heels matter a TON. I wish they didn't, but they really really do. \-SMILE!	I ALWAYS make the first move, I’m not going to wait for them to get off their asses. What I do is start with subtle/not subtle at all flirty looks, then I start getting subtly (not really) closer to them, if they receive this well starting conversation is easy.	0
What mental health cliche do you hate?	I have a poor follow.through of the brain synapse. In many cases that means the patient can have violent impulses. But its a myth that all patients do. In my case, its something like ADHD which makes it hard to concentrate. If I need to explain, ill just tell people I have ADHD so they won't be scared of me.	I hate those empty statements directed towards people struggling. Not a friend saying it but those "wholesome" posts. Like "You are not alone". Sometimes I fucking am. Especially with chronic mental health issues, sometimes you are just alone with it.	0
When people discuss relationship stuff on Reddit, what sort of stuff when you read it makes you feel like you’re taking crazy pills?	There was a post on here recently asking what thing is impressive to see when going over to a potential partner's home for the first time and most of the answers were some variation of a guy with a clean home/bathroom.	How many people are so quick to say "break up with them" as though that decision carries no weight. Not that there are situations where people should break up such as abuse Cheating, etc. How little people encourage others to work on themselves and their relationship. (Not in every case) but I think it's very frequent to see an issue that can be fixed through counseling and people say to just give up.	1
Do you ever sit down and ,all of the sudden, you can smell your genitals?	I don't mean this to be cruel, but I don't understand why no one else would smell it if you do, through your clothes. If anything, people tend to have issues smelling themselves when others do. To answer, no.	This is what I call the "dank as fuck" moment even if it's not that moist down there (though it's more obvious when it's damp). It's so noticeable to me that I get paranoid that maybe other people can smell it too. It's that mix of sweat, vaginal secretions and that general genital smell (it's hard to describe that genital smell, I've smelled it on my boyfriend while giving head which made me think "oh gee, penises and vaginas really are of the same stock, even in scent! If I was going down on a woman would she also smell like this? I guess we all smell like this!") Ok I digress...	0
What is the best thing you have ever done for your career?	Applied for a job I was sure I didn't have enough experience or knowledge to get. It was a long shot but I did it anyway. Got a dream job and set myself up way better than I would have if I'd only stuck to the things I thought I qualified for.	Joined the military. I am not in the military now, but my is heavily dependent on my previous knowledge and experience.	1
What are some ways you can be intimate with your partner without resorting to sex?	When we’re laying on the couch or bed, he likes to rest his head on my chest and I’ll run my fingers through his hair.	the word resorting troubles me... as if sex is a chore or not enjoyable. Although sex is not the be all and end all it shouldnt be thought of as 'oh god sex again'	1
Has anyone else ever been called out for.. and I quote " not acting like a real woman"?	My mother has often commented that I can't be a 'real girl' because I don't stuff my face with chocolate, watch or read romances or enjoy cooking. An ex boyfriend told me I was 'more like a man than a woman' because of my taste in music (?!) and my interest in martial arts. I choose to carry on doing my thing, trying to give as few shits as possible.	Maybe it is not about you beeing a women. But going to a fucking restaurant with a weapon behind your back is sort of weird in my opinion. Hell i would feel more unsafe when everybody who is a cop off duty + some other guys carry weapons arround everywhere they go. Honestly if someone robs you the best thing you can do is give them your shit. A weapon will heat up the situation unnessesarily. But maybe its because european and i will never get the american weapon thing.	1
Women of Reddit, what is the most awkward run in with your ex?	Well the guy I was with after him got me pregnant about 6 months after the breakup. (We are happy together and unofficially married) Haven’t run into him yet, but his aunt tells me he’s very upset I became pregnant by someone else... She also had to tell him the kid wasn’t his. Well he shouldn’t have acted like my abusive father, or one of my exs I told him he started reminding me of. Told him I didn’t want a repeat... Baby girl is a part of our world now. I also look like I was never pregnant... soooo if I see him again things are gonna be awkward.	When my mum died, my ex's mum came to the funeral, insisted on taking a selfie with me, and then sent it to him. We'd been broken up for six years at that point and were not in contact. So, not a direct run in, but definitely the most awkward moment of my life so far.	0
What’s it like to leave a high powered or high paying job to become a stay at home mom?	I don't think you could call teaching a high powered or high paid job, but I left that job to stay at home with my son. I'm also pregnant and due any week now. It was the best decision I ever made. My mental health has improved so much, I'm no longer constantly stressed and crying, my relationship with my partner has improved exponentially. We both value as stress\-free a life as possible and didn't see the point in me working if it was going to cause us more harm than good. We were more than willing to sacrifice a little extra income to improve our personal lives.	I left a 6-figure US$ job as a cancer-researcher to stay home with our baby. My husband did the same. We estimate we have 4-6 years before our financial situation requires us to go back to work. It's fun watching our daughter grow, be there for her firsts -- first step, first word, first run, first time going up stairs, etc. -- at this point, she's 20 months and babbling non-sense, but we're looking forward to making sense of it very soon.	0
Besides Reddit, which social media sites do you like and why?	Twitter is essentially dead. Even when it was more popular I found it boring and frustrating to deal with. I just use Facebook because it's super easy to use.	Any social media site that I can avoid people I know in real-life on, such as Twitter and Tumblr and Reddit. I can vent or post about anything I want and I don't have to worry about people I might run into out in the real world knowing stuff about me I'd rather they not know. I find the only way to do this on sites like Facebook is to just not post at all. I'm a very private person and I wouldn't even want people knowing my base interests. My closest friends know my Twitter and Tumblr accounts, and they're about the only people I feel comfortable sharing anything with.	0
What is a weird insecurity you have?	I'm insecure about not ever being as good as I could be due not even due to any physical or emotional limitations but that I have this potential that I'm wasting and genuinely don't how to use said potential	I have um... a large butt. I've been told it's a nice butt. And it's a good shape, and compliments my curves (by my boyfriend) but I'm just worried it's TOO big and I'll end up with a shelf back there. Not a fan of that possibility lol	1
What is a sacrifice if any that you have had to make in order to become more successful at dating/relationships?	Believe it or not, my dating life improved a whole lot when I started using makeup. Nothing heavy, just the basics of making myself more presentable.	When I moved in with my SO I had to start washing my bras more often so he didn't think I was a filth goblin.	0
What fun things did you learn about your SO when you moved in together?	Okay, so we didn't move in together, but I did stay with him for three and a half months over one summer. I learned * he can literally stay in bed all day every day and be okay with that * when he does dishes, he doesn't rinse anything and he puts dishes with caked-on stuff into the sink with no water and calls it "soaking" * he's really bad at remembering to change laundry from the washer to the dryer * he likes to come in while I'm showering just to look at me and smile * he's great with his dog - she doesn't like to eat away from humans, so he'll sit with her while she eats	That we mesh together incredibly well, especially considering we moved in together after only two months of dating! Oh and he sings while doing the dishes, along with dancing around shirtless while wearing a fedora :)	1
When did you realize people started to see you as an object of desire and no longer a little girl?	Reading through this is very depressing. I wonder where you all are from though? I’m Norwegian and kinda came here to say ‘never’, but thinking about it I guess I was hit on by a French guy in Paris when I was 16-17. Catcalling doesn’t really exist here, and apart from when I’ve been abroad or maybe a few times in bars with older men being gross, I’ve never really felt like ‘an object of desire’. Like, maybe I’m not pretty enough or I’m just oblivious to it, but I think this is a lot more widespread in certain cultures, like American and Mediterranean cultures.	12 and I, like pretty much everyone answering here, was a little girl who was super confused and uncomfortable when it happened. I wish I could go back in time and protect her and all of us.	0
Have you ever met a man that blew your mind away? What was he like?	Saw a guy for a while. He was tall, athletic (rugby), British (the accent was sexy), confident, and most importantly of all, goddam brilliant. Got his doctorate in math (topology) and even though I know nothing about it I loved to listen to him explain new concepts. And he fucked me like a goddam champ. Lots of dirty talk and hit all the right spots, ya know? But even though he blew my mind, he was also an asshole as he was cheating on someone else to see me. Making me the other woman, though I didn't know it at the time. Fucker (in more ways than one).	Genuinely gentle. Everything he says is matter-of-fact, even the emotional things, because there's no shame in feeling a certain way. He reads. He writes. He's creative and unafraid. Easy to talk to. He won't sugarcoat anything he has to say. He doesn't lose his temper easily. Quietly passionate. Dark eyes, intense and honest and smoldering and unafraid. That ~~boy's~~ man's smile is the thing every girl wants directed at them at least once. And when it happens, it always, *always* hits his eyes first. And I don't think he knows when it's happening, which makes it even better. When he looks at me and I see that little smile twitch in the corner of his eye, I melt. He's playful and protective and kind and one of the most goddamn amazing people I've ever met.	0
Have you ever realized that your best friend actually sucks as a friend?	3 of my bridesmaids all of a sudden decided they "couldn't" be at the wedding... And with only two months it'd be hard to find replacements. And then j realized I really don't have anyone to replace them with... My life is depressing...	We had been best friends for about 14 years. I realized it when I was sitting there one day about to send her a text message. I saw the last one had been a couple weeks earlier, and then thought about how I was always the first to reach out to her and if I didn't, I wouldn't hear from her at all. The days we would actually go out and get drinks or see a movie were great! It was like nothing had ever changed with us, but at some point she just stopped trying to maintain my friendship and I felt taken for granted. It makes me feel so sad that I am going through a hard time in my life (a separation with my husband of five years) and she doesn't even know about it.	0
Those who've had an abortion, what do you wish you knew beforehand?	Ignore people you think they can make that decision for you. Dont be ashamed, youre not doing anthting wrong. Its ok to be depressed for a few days, but then everything will be ok 🙏🏼	I'm the asker of this question. Thanks to everyone sharing their experiences. I am really struggling emotionally with my decision - logically this is the best decision, and I'm very thankful my partner supports me - but I'm still really scared. Your honest words really help. Thank you.	0
What have you done lately that makes you proud?	3 weeks and 3 days ago I packed my and my 1 year old son's bags, left my alcoholic husband, and haven't had a drop to drink since. I've lost fifteen pounds without trying, have the full support of my friends, and have an appointment for a pro bono divorce attorney this week. Had to bite the bullet and apply for cash assistance and am staying in a women's shelter while I search for housing and jobs (I was a SAHP and have no income or family in the area), but I FEEL AMAZING and haven't had such an elated outlook for the future in far too long.	I turned down a biscuit for fresh fruit at breakfast this weekend. Biscuits and gravy is one of my favorite things in the world, so I was very proud!	1
It's wedding season! What's the trashiest wedding you've ever been to?	Not really trashy but my husband has poor family members on his side. We were invited to a cousin's wedding so we went and it was on a campground in a park. Everyone brought their own food for potluck and no one was dressed to nicely and only wore regular clothes and we were the only ones dressed nicely. The only thing they had was a minister and he was someone in the family also so he did it for free and the wedding cake was just a regular cake. Most of the wedding presents were cards, I am assuming gift cards. This was one interesting wedding and when you don't have much money, there is a will, there is a way.	A friend of mine from high school met a guy through an online version of Prison Penpals while he was doing time for sexual assault of a minor. Within a couple weeks of him getting out of prison, she was pregnant. This would be his 5th kid with 4 different women. They got married at a barbecue joint a few months later and her dad wouldn't speak to anyone at the reception because he was so pissed that this was happening. They got divorced a couple months after the baby was born, and I think the bride's dad was much more excited to pay for the divorce than the wedding.	0
How do you get over an "almost" relationship?	I do not do almost. But for others I would think it best to treat it as a failed date, I suppose. Over it pretty quickly.	Treat it like a break up. I prefer going NC and I try not to dwell on the what-ifs and things I could've done to make things work. It takes me a little while to process and get out of my system, but I like to focus on the positives and what I learned from that "relationship" about myself. I reassure myself that I'll eventually find what I want, and that the end of this relationship is just a step closer to it.	0
How do you get excited about your life when things aren't all that exciting?	You get used it to. Life is rarely exciting. Thank goodness. Excitement takes a lot of energy. It wears you out--both body and soul. After awhile, it seems, you learn to enjoy the calm routine. Take pleasure in the smaller moments.	I keep a list on my phone of little things I love, and I read it when I need a pick me up. Sure, life isn't all exciting adventures and glamorous vacations, but damn it if Saturday morning pancakes aren't the best things ever. Or a good boob day. Or the way my dog sits like a human sometimes.	0
Ladies who have ever discovered their SO had a fetish that made you uncomfortable, how have you dealt with it?	I don't think both people have to be into the same things if there's communication and boundaries and a good give and take. I had an ex though that if it wasn't his thing (anal), he wasn't into it. I was down on occasion but it was such a shitty attitude that caused me to nope out. We rarely did engage in anything sexual for a long while. I ended up having to have sex with other people during our relationship to fill my need for regular sex.	My ex had a foot fetish and used to ask me to fuck him in this position where I'd sit on his cock and lean back with my feet in his face. I could actually *feel* him swelling up inside me when I did it, but the position did nothing for me and he actually ended up complaining that my feet didn't smell enough. Was a killer exercise for my abs though, so there's that.	0
Women who were initially unattractive in their young/teen years, and then became attractive, how has the experience been?	The people who bullied me at school for being different sometimes try hitting on me and I get a smug sense of satisfaction.	Welp, it sucks. I hate that I am treated better now that I am attractive. It discouraged me from fully developing a real personality, because attractive girls don't need to be funny or interesting to get noticed. And being that I am in my late 20s, I'm starting to worry about how well I'll navigate getting older and having to acknowledge that once again, I am invisible.	1
What is it actually like to be in a happy, healthy relationship?	Respect and open communication are key for us. We have very rare arguments - not even fights. We discuss issues rather than letting them build up. We make each other laugh.	It's absolutely awesome. Someone asked me the other day what I had been up to and I sai "pretty much nothing and its great, I'm just happy and content" meaning- when you're in a comfortable, stable relationship you don't need a bunch of outside shit to occupy you.	1
What's that one super embarrassing thing you did that keeps you up at 1am cringing about it years later?	I won best dressed at prom.. I said thank you all for voting for me because I was so shocked that my class did that and I was very unpopular then and spoke to no one and the "late chick" during my school days. Edit: I would like to make it clear that I was an awkward teenager and didn't expect this and didn't know what to say and I had said it as though I'm the prettiest girl in the world because I do not know what to say at that moment. I still cringe at this moment.	I was a new boss and had to fire an employee for the first time. She packed her bag, cleaned out her desk and I followed her to the door. And I said ... "See you later". It was just a habit. The way she looked at me ... I still cringe so hard thinking about it.	0
What's something you saw coming from miles away that other people didn't?	onlyfans shutting down pornography on its platform after it reached a certain level of prominence. paypal and patreon both did something very similar.	I’m into astrology and I love paying attention to upcoming transits and for 2020 I saw that there was going to be an event that resulted in a lot of deaths and sure enough the pandemic hit	1
Women over 35, what's some advice you received when younger that you ignored that you wish you hadn't?	"Don't shave your legs." My mother told me this when I was younger (I didn't listen). She never shaved her legs and has always had super-fine light colored hair that makes it look like she doesn't even have any. Me? If I don't shave now, I look like Chewbacca (except with darker hair). Should have listened to Mom. :/ Edit: I just wanted to clear something up. My response here is a valid (though anectdotal) situation that actually did happen. Yes, I realize the myths that many people believe about hair getting darker, etc. Yes, I realize that me following along with what my mother did might not have yielded the same result. Still, it was always an interesting concept - and it worked wonders for Mom. I just answered the question that was asked, as it pertains to me. Downvoting doesn't even make sense.	Brush your teeth. Seriously. The second set have a limited warranty and you really don't want to have to get expensive dental work when you're 40. (Edit - Also, floss. You only floss the teeth you want to keep. Thanks /u/yogurtmeh) Wear sunscreen. Even when it is cloudy. Skin cancer is no joke. Make sure you get the backs of your hands and the tops of your feet. He is not worth ruining your life for. Either is she. The only one who puts you first is you unless you get really, really stupidly lucky. Call your parents.	0
At what point did you feel like an adult? Started seeing yourself as a woman rather than a girl?	I was sixteen. My aunt had just died, my mom was suicidal, my sister was having a really hard time in school, my dad was getting arrested (not that we even lived with him), and my grandma was just starting to show the signs of senility. I became the head of my house then. And all I could think about my life was that it was all very rude.	I'm 23, not yet. which is funny because I moved out when I was 15, got my first job while studying when I was 17. Have worked and moved further and further away from my parents and family. Had a long term relationship for 4 years that crashed and burned. Now I live in another country with what I'm pretty sure is the love of my life and yet sometimes when I call my mum to complain about bills or budgeting she just goed "Isn't it nice to feel like a grown up?". Pfth, I still feel like a 16 year old just faking it. I don't think I'll ever start feeling like a woman.	0
What should guys know about periods?	Sometimes with a heavy period blood might get on the sheets. It's so embarrassing. If it ever happens to a girl with you just say it's no big deal and wash the sheets.	I might have an unpopular opinion, and I used to have *horrific* periods... But I don't think they're a fair excuse to be rude or overly emotional towards one's SO, and if a girl is using her period as an excuse to be an asshole to you, find someone else. Physically it can be very painful, so it can limit some women's ability to do things... Help if it's within your ability to do so... She will be very grateful! But really, it varies so much from woman to woman, you just have to figure out what is going on with the specific woman you're seeing.	1
Who are your favorite influential women & why?	Carrie Fisher. She was a mental health advocate, an incredible outspoken woman, and absolutely earned her place as the face the rebellion with her post- Star Wars work. She had great things to say about the Slave Girl Leia outfit or whatever it's called, and what to tell kids about it - "Tell them that a giant slug captured me and forced me to wear that stupid outfit, and then I killed him because I didn't like it. And then I took it off. Backstage." Ruth Bader Ginsburg - because she is a national treasure. A good quote from her: "I’m sometimes asked when will there be enough [women on the supreme court] And I say ‘When there are nine.’ People are shocked. But there’d been nine men, and nobody’s ever raised a question about that."	Hillary Clinton. She's been working to improve lives since her twenties and hasn't stopped. I will stan for her until the day I die.	1
I just found out I'm pregnant. What was your experience with getting an abortion?	Hey -- I've never had an abortion, but FYI I used to be an abortion counsellor at a feminist health clinic and abortion provider. Happy to answer any questions you may have regarding what I learned from my clients.	I haven't had an abortion but i'm not against it. I hope you make the right decision for yourself, whatever it may be. If you are taking the abortion, you are still pro life. You are pro YOUR life, which is equal to the clump of cells in your body. Now as selfish as it sounds, having children is selfish no matter what. Kids never ask to be born so to make a choice in this will always be a selfish one. You will get through this, talk to someone you trust and make sure you have at least 1 person to support you, maybe to discuss this with, someone that can be as neutral as possible and knows you and your life. Good luck!	1
Have you ever had a sudden gut feeling like something isn't right and turns out it was accurate? What happened?	Not too long ago I had to take blood from a patient, I just saw him from behind walking to his room and instantly something in me said "NOPE.". I went to one of the male nurses and asked him to accompany me to the patient's room, he was a little confused but did as I asked. Turns out that patient was just in our part of the hospital for one scan, he is usually in the psychiatric ward and has molested children and had attempted to rape a caretaker about 30 years (?) ago. He is usually only cared for by male nurses or at least while there is someone male present, since he does not seem to respect women as human beings at all.	My bff's ex boyfriend. First heard about him and I instinctually thought he was a bad person. When she told me she was scared to break up with him because she thought he'd become violent, I asked her why and he'd been sexually abusing her. Not to mention he hates dogs and supports Donald Trump.	1
It's Saturday! What should you be doing, and what are you actually doing?	I should probably be playing LoL because I won't have as much time for it tonight. Instead I'm just chillin on reddit.	I'm sitting in my living room listening to good music, sipping coffee and browsing reddit. Which is exactly what I should be doing on a Saturday, dammit!	0
What was life like before & after you got medication for your mental illness?	I have a good friend who is definitely the most angry hard to get along with person I know. Recently started taking some type of medication and is a completely different person. I do worry about the medication numbing the deep issues but for the current moment she's enjoyable to be around.	I feel like my meds (Prozac) reduced my symptoms by around 30 percent. Now I have the energy to do therapy, CBT, make positive changes in my life etc so then I expect that as I do those things, the symptoms will reduce further. I'm on Prozac. It really helped my mind get quieter. All of a sudden I had room in my brain to think of better things.	0
Ladies, what's something you've stopped telling people because you're tired of the way they respond?	I hate mentioning eating healthy and exercising. People automatically respond with "You're not fat why would you do all that?" First, I never said I was (5'1 100lbs) second, I just want to be a healthier person! I have zero muscle in my body and get tired from physical activity very easily so I just want to better myself.	I generally don't bring up that I'm pro-life. It's my personal beliefs, it's not a judgement on other people, and I don't want to fight about my faith. I get how separation of church and state works, if we don't agree on when a fetus is alive it's a pointless discussion...	1
Sleep talkers, what's the funniest or most embarrassing thing you've said while sleeping?	Not sleep talking and not me, but the guy I'm seeing gets handsy when he falls asleep. It's not all the time though. I usually wake up or am already awake when this occurs. So sometimes when I realize he's asleep I'll stop but sometimes it continues. It's usually really good sex! Not nearly as funny, or at all funny, like most everyone else's! Thank you for all the laughs :)	Girlfriend sleep talks with the best of them. My favorite one was when I slid into bed about an hour after she had already fallen asleep, and I put my hand on her shoulder, and she mumbled "Can you please let go of the Facebook icon?" I asked what she said and she repeated it. So I took it off her shoulder and placed it on her hip. She said "Can you take your hand off of Microsoft word?" I took my hand off of her and she nodded sleepily. Then a minute later so woke up, or so I thought, and looked at me and said "hold on, I need to compile myself." That's the night I found out she was a computer.	0
My cats are plainly tired of me asking them if they are silly cats. What kind of conversations do you hold with your pets?	My guinea pig picks what movie we watch. I hold up a bunch of movies and whichever one he smells first is the one we watch. Based on his track record, he's a big fan of Guardians of the Galaxy.	I have a rescue kitten with clear abandonment issues so I try to talk to her as normal as possible. Mostly I just ask her where her toys are, because she keeps hiding them. I'm also raising her bilingual in german and english.	1
To what degree do you think the notion of "sex dies after marriage" is true? What do you think are the causes for it?	From the 1977 movie "Annie Hall", which stars Woody Allen as Alvy Singer and Diane Keaton as Annie Hall. -------------------------------------------- ALVY'S PSYCHIATRIST: How often do you sleep together? ANNIE'S PSYCHIATRIST: Do you have sex often? ALVY: Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week. ANNIE: Constantly! I'd say three times a week.	Many people use sex as a tool to obtain and secure a relationship. For these people, the more secure the relationship, the less need for them to continue to have sex. Exclusivity is more secure than casual dating; engaged is more secure than exclusivity; married is more secure than engaged; having kids is more secure than just married.	1
So, I'm sterile. When should I mention this?	I wouldn't mention it on a first date but with in the early stages of dating before you get to the commitment might be the best time to mention it. How old are you if you don't mind me asking?	Tell her when she says "I'm Pregnant". Also double check every year because there are some cases where balls start working again. I know a couple who were both told neither of them could reproduce and they have 2 kids now.	1
How did you get over your ex knowing that they are fine and already over you?	I was upset and working on getting over it for 3 months, then saw all his wedding pictures online. Did the math and found out how long he'd been cheating. Then I got pissed off. The anger faded to apathy, and it's a really great feeling.	I made a conscious decision to move on, satisfied with the knowledge that better men and bigger dicks await me. He would have held me back. He was never going to leave Edmonton. He was a bar manager and he had a tiny marketing business and he lives with his mother at 27 (not that that's inherently bad, but it was just laziness on his part - he had more than enough to move out.). He had no direction. I did love him, but he was no good for me and didn't treat me well. I can't stand for that. Look at your ex's flaws. Look at the reasons that he couldn't possibly satisfy you long term.	1
People of AskWomen, what advice would you give to a couple about to live together?	Decide how you will pay household bills. Maybe open a joint bank account just for household expenses and each of you deposit enough to pay for rent, utilities, and saving for household emergencies each month. It's not romantic, but it is important that each of you have a clear understanding and agreement regarding your finances.	MAKE SURE HE DOES HIS FAIR SHARE! So many men think that once they have a woman in the house tthey can just slack off on all the chores. Do not stand for this. Do not give in and take care of it "just this once." It will become a pattern for your life. You've already established ground rules, now just make sure you stick to them! And make sure to keep some money and maybe a bag of clothes and stuff squirreled away somewhere he doesn't know about. Not saying you have reason to be worried but if things go south you don't want to be stuck there because youre broke or don't have a way to leave easily.	1
So, it looks like Britain has officially voted 'Leave' in the 'Brexit' referendum-- AskWomen, what do you think?	I'm ecstatic. In the long run, it will be a great move for Britain. Brussels should do some deep soul-searching on what is happening as the world moves toward greater autonomy and self-governance. I'm very impressed that the Brits were able to see the long term benefits and rejected the fear mongering projected by the global corporatocracy benefactors. Yeah, UK!	My only hope is that this will drive Scotland to reconsider and leave the UK. A big reason for them staying was because they wanted to stay in the EU, and now they're out anyway.	0
Which Disney couples are most likely to divorce?	I would hope Mulan divorces her husband and find someone more accepting of her desire to not adhere to gender roles.	Cinderella and Prince Charming shared one dance and a few minutes for a shoe fitting. When Prince Charming listens to her stories about her mice friends and her fairy godmother, he is probably going to assume that she is mentally insane.	0
How do you react to other women putting you down?	Also, a feigned look of pity and a gentle "I would be so embarrassed if I spoke to people the way you do." Bonus points if there are others around to hear it, as they'll always agree with you.	Remember that hurtful people are usually hurting a lot on the inside too. It doesn't excuse behaviour, but being nice in return can ameliorate the situation a lot more quickly and cleanly.	1
It's late night, dark outside, and you're walking on an empty sidewalk. I'm walking behind you for a pretty long time because I'm going in the same direction, do I speed up my pace to walk past you or slow down considerably?	Protocol is that you walk as fast or slow as you want. If she's uncomfortable then she might cross to the other side. I don't have to prove that I'm not a rapist.	If you're going to stay behind me please just keep your distance. I'm probably going to start walking faster whatever you do. If you come speeding up behind me because you're about to pass I'm going to find it initially alarming and then be glad that you're in front of me once you've passed. If you crossed the street I would find that reassuring but recognise it's not your responsibility to do that.	0
Most snobbish behavior you've ever encountered?	My friend was on a break while working at subway and asked a lady where she had gotten her shoes (they were really cute) The lady replied, "don't talk to me minimum wage" and left in a huf. We were too shocked to say anything.	Oh man. There was a guy on the bus who scolded me for putting my feet on the seat. I was sitting with one leg folded under my other. It's not like I was treating it like a damn ottoman! And it was the bus. In NYC. A homeless person probably peed on it before. I know this doesn't seem to snobbish, but if you saw the way he said it, you'd know why this is still with me like 3 years later.	1
What is that one thing your partner does that you find endearing?	He always says sorry because he knows I’m incapable of doing it first. I’m working on it, but bless him for ending our small arguments.	Before he leaves on a work trip (which is often) he’ll hide little notes around the house for me to find.	0
What is the worst experience you've had at a hair salon?	She once accidentally cut through the wire of my £7 headphones. Was a bad move on my part in hindsight.	I have black hair. It was cut and styled in a way that made me look like Darth Vader. My lip was trembling as I thanked them and left.	0
[Update - I had the interview] A potential employer made a sexual joke during our e-mailing back and forth. Bad sign?	That's not a sexual joke. A sexual joke would be: "Well, I hope you won't take up Football Fridays with HR" That guy is a straight up misogynist. And possibly a creep.	Gross. You are doing the right thing by bringing this all up to the women counter-part. Good luck, I'd like to hear what she says.	0
Ladies, have any of you actually been told to smile by strangers?	Yes. I was walking to my bus, my dog had just died, I was in no mood to smile. A guy told me "You should smile! Life isn't that bad!" when I didn't he said "And that's why you will die alone." What The Fuck? I live in the US, Missouri.	Huh. I say this to people. I didn't realize this was a bad thing. Does it help that I usually say it as, "Smile! It gets better!" or a variant, regardless of the sex of the person, or what I perceive to be their attractiveness? I usually only say it to folks who look bummed.	1
Fellow unattractive/average looking women, how do you prevent becoming bitter due to the treatment you get (or don't get) because of your physical appearance?	Remember how uncomfortable it was to be hit on at my last job. I'm not attractive, but I'm in a male dominated field.	Find great, quality people who love me and don't judge on appearance. Find ways to raise my own self-esteem that aren't based on appearance, or are external, but are not based on the opinions of others. Be okay with having only so many people in my life (but that's just because I'm bad at putting myself out there, probably...)	0
Have you ever had a crush on a man who was "inappropriately older" than yourself? What was it about him that made you so attracted?	I had a crush on the parent of a child I used to work with a couple of years back. He was around 40 and I was 21. Also when I was 18 I had a short fling wih a 40 year old.	I crush on at least one professor every semester. They're usually in their fifties if not older. I'm attracted to their intelligence and confidence and the command they have over their classes.	0
What is something you realized later in life that you really should know how to do?	Managing a menstrual cycle. I was 25 and still ruining sheets. Just totally unpredictable. I just got an IUD instead. Problem solved!	I really should know how to fold fitted sheets instead of stuffing them into my linen closet in a giant ball.... I’ll be 90 and still not know how.	0
What’s the best hotel you ever got to stay at?	Ashford Castle in Ireland. I mean, it’s a literal castle. What’s not to like? It had the most beautiful pool and spa area. The tea service was excellent. I felt like I was a lady in Downton Abbey. I took a falconry lesson on the grounds. Overall amazing experience. It was like living out my girlhood fantasy.	Disclaimer:- I am not a woman (since I am posting in r/AskWomen) &#x200B; &#x200B; how does one afford hotel rooms costing more than 100$ / night? barely any of the first 20 odd hotel I saw here come anywhere close to my weekly budget for a hotel room. 400$ a night! the castle (but obv) was 800$ per night. &#x200B; I wonder if these offers are all including every meal one eats during the stay and all facilities, spa, massages, adventure park or yoga etc courses are included in the price? &#x200B; edit:- I tend to look at the money I actually have in my hand and make my budget. I do not think of credit when it comes to a holiday. Maybe core engineering doesn't pay as much ? (snide comment to myself really)	1
What are some things about office culture you wish you had known about before starting your job?	Don't buy new clothes for a new job unless or until you see the office. I got new dress pants and a couple of button up shirts and my grandmother bought me a suit. Everybody in the office was wearing jeans.	I work in retail and honestly it’s not that bad. The thing is though, you have to be mentally prepared for ANYTHING. Mostly it’s just the oddly dressed person, or a weird or funny comment. One time I had these two young boys come in and after a few minutes of browsing the candy shelf, one of them turns to the other and with a completely straight face says: “You’re too lazy to be alive.” I felt that. You felt that. The world felt that.	1
Former sorority sisters, what were your best/worst experiences and how do you feel about Greek life now?	I don't understand sororities. College is (most of the time) an education that you are paying for, not a social life. I read things about these groups, and it just comes across as people that either want to bully people, or form a imaginary cast system so they can have a reason to look down upon people. I am interested for anyone in their 30's to respond on their post sorority life.	Based on my experiences, Best: you meet a lot of people. Like, a lot. The parties throw together a bunch of drunk underaged people who want to be friends with everyone. Which leads to to... Worst: Fast friendships tend to be superficial. You make friends quickly and lose them easily. So, it's a lot of fun, just be careful about who you invest your trust in.	0
Women, what is the most awkward situation you've experienced when a guy asked you out?	I've learned to shake off awkwardness, but once when I was 15, I was at the mall with my mom. I left her to buy a slushie and the guy working the counter was probably 16 or 17. When I tried to give him money, he said, "Don't worry about it, it's on me." I, confused and oblivious, kept trying to hand him money. He just kind of giggled at me, I must have looked so lost, and eventually I ran away. GO ME!	I was working at subway. And this guy and his friend came in for about 3 weeks straight. I honestly thought they were gay. Then one day, the friend decided to ask me out for the other guy, while the other guy waited in the car "My friend really likes you, and is too afraid to ask you out, you're the only reason we've been eating subway so much" I was about 22 at the time. He was 26. Acting like a 10 year old. I went on the date, because I felt bad and thought eh why not. Turns out we had NOTHING in common and at the end he casually asked when he could take me to dinner next. To which I replied.. "uh....idk" and walked away. I felt awful. I was so awkward. Over it.	0
Do you find most guys are bad kissers? What do they do wrong? Do you bring it up when you don't like it?	We all like different things, and do different things. Much like sex, you have to communicate. If that's too much to ask, lower your expectations.	Out of the 12 or so guys I've kiss, I'd say I had 5 who were just awful. They open their mouths super wide and essentially try to eat my face. I actually developed a nasty cracking sound in my jaw from having to open my jaw beyond the comfortable level. Mostly brought on by a guy I refer to as Tuna.	0
Tomorrow, one color you choose will disappear forever. What color and why?	That yellow/green/brown mix that only appears in vomit and pretty much nowhere else. I have no need for that colour.	Blue. I can't tell it apart from green very well. Also, I really dislike a lot of things related to it. The daytime sky, artificially flavored "blue raspberry" drinks, etc.	1
Do you keep people around as friends that you have slept with in the past? If so, how does that affect your current relationship?	Of course. Otherwise, I'd have, like, no friends. It doesn't affect my current relationships, as far as I can tell. I mean, my partners are friends with them, too.	Nope. They're in the past and all live far away. Except for that one guy who now lives with my sister. That was kinda awkward for a while.	0
Any other women totally terrified about pooping when people are around?	Most women in my office go to a different floor to do it. I actually appreciate the fact that there's one less gender funking up the hallways with poop odors. I used to date a girl who would often stay over on weekends but leave abruptly on Sunday. I had a REALLY small apartment at the time. I couldn't really figure out why but now I get it. I appreciate the gesture but would prefer if she just pooped, took a shower and hung out a bit longer. I didn't want her to be uncomfortable around me though and I suspect she would have been if she blew up the bathroom in my tiny apartment.	Meh. not really. I sleep over at my boyfriend's house for 24+ hours sometimes and at some point, nature will call. Poop is poop. Just a part of life. He does it too!	0
What was it that made you realize you were in a toxic relationship with your partner?	Any time we had to talk about a misunderstanding/disagreement/hurt feelings it escalated into a huge issue. He was so defensive and had to be the victim in any situation. Small things always turned into big ones	You could just take break it sounds corny but if it’s meant to be you guys could would be able to last after a break up you know like if it’s meant to be it’s meant to be but you never know you might just find someone that will treats you better	1
"Women need to feel loved to have sex. Men need to have sex to feel loved…'' Thoughts?	Also, why the fuck did the men of AskMen think that they had such an insight into the psyches of all *women*??	I don't think it's necessarily a men vs women thing. But some PEOPLE absolutely do need sex and intimacy to feel loved by and bonded to their partners. Yes.	0
What are the red flags to look out for in a friendship?	Emotionally unstable people. The ones who from 0 to 60 in anger and will get in screaming matches. Yikes. And also the ones who become your "best friend" immediately after meeting them. It seems pretty disingenuous and means they've probably cycled through other "best friends" before you. Usually the people who complain about being surrounded by drama start it themselves.	If you feel emotionally drained each time you talk to someone, something isn't going well. I also don't like friends that you only get to see when they're single. Especially if those periods consist of comforting them over the break-up, obsessing over everything a new guy said/did, until that new guy is the bf and the 'friend' is gone again.	0
What do you wish would stop being romanticized?	Petty fighting. If a man and a woman drive each other up a wall, TV thinks they should be together. In reality it sounds like a load of unnecessary stress.	Fat acceptance disguised as body positivity and self love. There comes a point that you are no longer loving yourself or taking care of yourself if you are on the extreme end of the weight spectrum. On either side. I'm all for being happy with how you look, but we can't ignore health.	1
Women who often have people over, what tips do you have to make your place more inviting?	Let me bring my dog. Seriously. I'm more likely to come over, stay for awhile and get drunk if I can bring my dog. I don't want to leave her at home so if I can't bring my dog odds are I leave early.	I guess you are the most important factor. If you are inviting and a relaxed host, who allows your guests to feel comfortable/at home, they will feel comfortable/at home. Just let them be. and having comfortable seating and a normal hygenic apt is key.	0
For those who have stopped wearing make-up or greatly reduced its use, what made you call it quits/reduce, and how has the change affected the way people view or treat you?	Honestly I just got lazy and prefer the 15 extra minutes I can sleep in before work. I only put on makeup when I'm getting together with my friends or going out on the weekends or at nights with my SO. No one treats me differently about it. At work it's more about the quality of my projects, not what my face looks like.	I only wear eye liner, mascara, and cover up literally. And people still compliment me on how it makes me look nice. So you don't really need a lot to look good :)	1
How do you keep yourself from crying in situations you don't want to be seen crying?	I think about totally random things - lettuce. books. stairs. fruit. I just run through a list of random objects to distract myself and calm myself down enough to stop the tears.	I've established a reciprocal crying arrangement with a co-worker. If either of us is about to start crying, we go to the others office, close the door and pretend we are in a meeting. If she's out of the office, I go to the washroom until I get control of myself.	1
Is it just me or has /r/askwomen turned into /r/howtopickupgirls???	Seems that way at some points in time, but I also see a lot of other relevant discussions here that I appreciate reading and when appropriate I appreciate participating in. I think a lot of the posts you're seeing that come off that way are likely not guys trying to "pick up" women, but men genuinely wanting to connect with women, but who lack the confidence of the understanding, or the knowledge of appropriate situational awareness. In my experience, guys who are looking for tips on how to "pick up" women look to other guys for advice.	Oh please, like it was ever anything but. AskMen has been that way just as long, if not longer. My point is, this is nothing new.	1
What is your 'jerk-filter' when dating/on early stages of relationship?	For me it's also seeing how they treat waiting staff or people who serve them in general (shop clerks etc.) Other than that, a guy can't be racist/homophobic/bigoted, support right wing political parties, abortion ban etc.	* the classic "how they treat waitstaff" - not just nicely, but also without any condescension and with appropriate tips * how he reacts to small boundaries or inconveniences - if it's small and doesn't matter and yet they react badly, how much worse can I expect them to react when it matters to them? * what their friends are like, including how they treat each other, how they treat me, and who they are in general	0
What were some obvious (in hindsight) red flags that your SO didn’t love you anymore?	He stopped wanting to spend birthdays and holidays together and called me clingy when I asked him why. He put a password lock on his phone and would turn it away from me when he was on it. Despite that, I caught him flirting with another girl on his phone. He said it was harmless. The final red flag was raised when I went to visit him on his day off and his mother (who I only met a handful of times) greeted me at the door and congratulated me on my pregnancy. When I confronted him about who he impregnated, he told me I misunderstood his mother and said I was ruining our relationship with my distrust. I think his son is about 8 years old now? The gaslighting with that guy was incredible... only to be outdone by my denial.	They're all controlling and Snoopy to varying degrees. You won't really know until you live with them. Oh and they definitely get much better over time.	1
What are some tips you have for someone moving into her first apartment?	When you move, regardless of how far you're going, have toilet paper ready and also some garbage bags. What I usually do is load a tall garbage can with all the bathroom stuff (shower curtain, hand soap, etc), toilet paper, water, and garbage bags, and bring that in first. Don't forget a plunger for each bathroom, either!	Always buy furniture and expensive decor that you like, not that fits your apartment. Our couch is an absolutely huge sectional, and our bed takes up a whole wall, but when we move out, at least we won't have to buy new furniture that fits our new space because we already have it!	1
What do you think of "Living Apart Together" (LAT) relationships?	My ultimate dream is to buy a duplex and knock out an inner wall to create one giant living room with my side and his side houses. It's two houses in one!	Seems like a fantastic waste of financial resources to maintain two residences. Fiscally moronic. If you can't live with your partner then they are probably not the right partner.	1
How do you deal with a friend who is constantly coming to you about their toxic “situationship” but won’t leave them?	You have two options. 1. You tell them you can't handle it anymore and the conversation needs to stop and possibly go low/no contact. Or 2. You provide help and support where you can. You encourage them to be more independent, to be strong, to take care of themselves with the hope that when they're strong enough they will make a better decision.	I become pretty distant and have no emotion when they bring up the same thing. Or in some cases I Left the friend. Once to three times is fine. I get it takes time to disconnect from a person But any more than that is just finding an excuse to complain and do nothing about it because at the end of the day they choose it Toxic venting is a thing and I won’t have it near me.	1
Ladies! What's a neat trick you do with your make-up?	Clear mascara to keep my brows in place and a bit of light concealer in a shade one step lighter than my foundation beneath my eyes to cover up dark bags and lighten my eyes. I have warm based olive skin and I wear a bold lip just about erryday. I played around until I found a fuchsia, a red, a wine, and a hot pink that look great with my skin and now I'm bold and bright all the time. Best compliment I've ever gotten was from my bf's cousin at *her* wedding. "I love that bold lip!" Even though she looked absolutely gorgeous as well!!	Apply lipstick, blot with tissue, apply small amount of translucent powder to lips, apply lipstick again and it will stay on your lips forever (or at least for an evening!).	0
Ladies, what examples of sexism towards men do you notice?	As a man I don't really ever feel objectified. I want to say it's impossible, but that isn't accurate because maybe some other men have felt that way. I'd really love to hear from people about men being objectified as I've never experienced it.	One of the biggest ones I've seen in my line of work is the lack of male teachers and childcare workers due to sexism towards men. I've actually heard people say that any man who is interested in working with kids is probably a pedophile (WTF!). It's completely unfair to men and it's not a great thing for the children to experience, either. It also bothers me that there's so much pressure to be a super manly macho man. My boyfriend likes fashion and cooking, and plenty of people feel the need to question his sexuality or make him feel bad about himself. Screw that.	0
Anyone else constantly labelled 'sweet and innocent'? What does it actually mean?	The last person who said something like that to me said that I still had light in my eyes. He said that the world still hasn't stolen my light. And then he ripped my heart out and I took my light into a deep depression. Yeah. Fuck that light. I still have it, I guess, I just don't share it with anyone anymore except for an amount of people that I can count on one hand and aren't related to me. I guess it meant naïveté, yes. But also being able to see the goodness in things without the cloudy glasses of fucked up experiences. I've been through somethings - but I can accept that situations aren't indicative of life in its totality. The flowers still bloom although a tsunami can decimate an entire coastline.	I don't often get those words specifically but that seems to be the general vibe that people get. It's because I'm tiny (4'11) and quiet, nice, and a wee bit shy. It doesn't bother me but I don't think it's very accurate. My life has most definitely not allowed me to remain innocent to any degree. Just because I choose to keep my thoughts to myself doesn't mean all I have is visions of sunshine and rainbows.	0
"Feminism isn’t just about helping women, it’s about helping men too." So, feminists of /r/AskWomen, what have you recently done in the name of feminism to help end sexism and oppression towards men?	I told a coworker he needed to get a better lawyer because he shouldn't be paying child support on a child that he was led to believe was his after a marriage where his ex wife had married him in a state where she could get the most bang for his buck. He thinks he has to do it because he is a man and should help provide. I thought he was taking gender roles a little to seriously. Edit: I work with a lot of guys that are taken advantage of for their benefits. The amount of spouse/child support talks I hear at lunch is nuts.	I really don't like the tone of your post and how you've put this question across. I don't know where you got this quote from, but I'd be interested in the source and context if it, because I think you may have misinterpreted it. Feminism IS about womens' rights. The notion that men can benefit from it may be what you're referring to, but that doesn't mean feminism is there to serve men. Men already have many of the privileges women are still fighting for. I realise you've already apologised for the use of the word "oppression", but that really is a horrible error. You're undermining the whole feminist movement by challenging feminists to answer to what they've done "to help men". Really, are you joking?	1
Have you been belittled by someone and proved them wrong immediately?	Some girl laughed and called me fat when I got my BMI done. The couch/gym person said she could go next since she acted like she would do better. Turns out my fat % was significantly lower, I was just very muscular. I also had large breasts, which she had none. The couch told me great job and told her she needed to start lifting weights, or just move more, as she had no muscle mass, just fat. She was not happy, and the rest of the group just snickered. I was still too embarassed from her comment to enjoy it until later and basically just sat there. Tldr: Skinny fat girl calls athletic me fat, gets scientifically put in her place.	There are other things I can't recall now, but a common thing for me is being told people under 18 aren't allowed to ____ and getting to pull out the ID that says I'm 22. Baby face problems...	0
What are the not so obvious qualities of a good boyfriend?	Lots of good advice in this thread, but honestly, I find it sad that all this wouldn't be more obvious.	My boyfriend does such little insignificant things but I find it super sweet. For example, foldy chips are my favourite. Every time he finds a folded chip in the bag he tries to give it to me. Like for five years this has been going on.	0
What's the worst conversation you've ever had with a random man?	in the apartment complex where I live, that are several India men (they work near here) and one of their apartment has its porch turned to the backyard. my cats love to play there so I take them everyday and enjoy to take a walk. it's been a week I think that they (the Indian men) keep staring at me, like really watching while I walk. today I was tired of this bullshit I decided to talk with them, I'm thanks they did not disturbed me anymore. I hope they don't it tomorrow. it wasn't one of the worst "conversations" but I know, it feels like I don't have privacy, respect or safety inside my own home!! feels terrible to think that I can't walk my cats without being bothered by man with disgusting stares.	being hit on or cat called at the age of like 11-13 by grown men when I clearly looked like a little girl fucked me up	0
what are things women are jealous of in other women that men would never know it's a thing to be jealous of?	I have wavy mermaid hair that looks great when it air dries, nice shaped nails, blonde body hair, great natural brows, nice writing/handwriting, an average 2-4 day period with no cramps since I was 15, a really solid metabolism, I've been told I can rock the "just rolled out of bed" look, I'm crafty/creative, and have naturally long eyelashes. Holy fuck, I hate *myself* now. I hit the lottery and didn't even know it. I'm just gonna... sit over there.	I am incredibly envious of women who can just let their hair air dry and have effortlessly perfect hair. I can't even shower away from home because if I don't have my products, straightener or blowdryer available, it's curly, messy, frizzies all in my face. And don't even get me started on swimming.	0
What is the most romantic date you've been on?	He suggested we ride bikes to the cemetery at dusk. When we got there, a bat flew in front of the full yellow moon. I brought a blanket and we sat on it and talked for hours in the dark. We were both too shy to kiss each other. Then, out of nowhere, fireworks started. Seriously. Real fireworks, for no reason we could discern, started up out of nowhere and lasted for about 5-10 minutes. After that we biked to a bar and had dinner and I kissed him. That was in August, and we're still together. (The yellow moon was from forest fires nearby. The fireworks were in celebration of a new light rail line.)	I'm a buzzkill, but what's romance? Can't seem to find a decent guy close by that wants anything to do with a "fat" girl. Had a guy take me to a baseball game once, which was great. Been a really looong tome since I've had a bona fide date though.	1
What was the scariest instance of street harassment that has happened to you?	Probably the men who tried to drag me into their car after the blizzard in London in January,1982. A man and his dog were the main reason I wasn't forced in their car. A very close second was the cab driver who stopped me in front of my house and told me he followed me every single day on my way to secondary school. He said knew which house was mine and I was so beautiful and wouldn't I give him my number and be his girlfriend? That was worse than the blokes trying to abduct me, because I was having panic attacks for weeks and all cabs look alike. Every time I saw a cab, I was panicking for a month and my mother just pooh-pointed it. I never saw him again, to the best of my knowledge.	On behalf of the male species - I'm sorry. I don't understand the logic or rationale that anyone could use to make these things acceptable in their head. But I guess that's it..it's not logical or rational. These guys can't seriously think that you will all suddenly swoon because they asked for a kiss, stalked you, or yelled inappropriate things at you. I'm makes me ashamed to be human really.	1
How did you find out you were cheated on?	Male here, sorry😔 Use to travel for work. Came home and everything was normal. She had been reading the fifty shades of grey book, thought nothing of it. Later that night my phone dies, so i grab hers to send some emails. Turns out she has ads on CL looking for someone to be her MR. Grey. Forgave that one, then found out she was having sex with strangers on CL. Forgave that. Then she found a lover at her work, thats when the shit hit the fan. Divorced now but it was a long uphill battle. Happily divorced with 4 kids by my side. She's still sexing around and it kinda hurts knowing she is but what can i do? Cant go back to that. Time will tell when ill find my 2nd half again.	The girl he cheated on me with told me. She had no idea he was in a relationship and when she found out, she let me know what happened. Strangely enough, we're actually sorta friends now.	0
Kinky people of /r/AskWomen, have you ever had a "bad" BDSM experience?	I learned that I *cannot* be ignored as a "punishment". It sends me to a really scary, dark place and I still don't know why. I'm always upfront that it can never happen for me now though. I also think that 50 shades should be considered harmful because it promotes dangerous/abusive behaviour and newbies won't know better resulting in a lot of emotional/physical harm.	I had a bottom who didn't know his boundaries well. He *said* he was willing to go to a certain point, but in reality, he stopped far short and complained during the entire fucking scene. I was so frustrated; I refused to do BDSM play with him after that because he didn't know shit about his own boundaries and needs.	1
What's the angriest you've been at your partner? Why? How did you act and how did you calm yourself down?	She supports NATOs actions in Ukriane. I got so pissed off i almost popped a vein. I stormed out and smoked half a pack of cigarettes. Was not a fun day.	My ex. If we got into an argument, he would literally just ignore me until I said whatever it was he wanted to hear. Or he would yell at me until I snapped and said whatever he wanted to hear. I was constantly crying out of frustration and exhaustion. Constantly. And he would get pissy about it. One day I was just so fed up with his shit that I just... shut down. I stopped crying in the middle of crying and yelling, and said very calmly, “I’m done. Get out.” He left. To this day, I can not stand it when somebody gives me the silent treatment. It will literally drive me up a wall. I’m not asking to talk about the argument or the problem, but I need to know that you’re okay.	0
What is a trait you struggle to find in a man?	Genuine interest. Relationships always start great, but I find that after a while, he'll get too comfortable and think he can stop treating me nicely and I'll still stick around. General apathy is usually what I experience.	Most of these answers so far, seem to be personality based, which can be fixed or amended with proper company. The one trait that I see slip by many men, that is the most sexy, attractive, and the all around best trait is: **confidence**. A man who lacks confidence is one to be ignored; a man with great confidence is one to be noticed, despite intelligence, stature, or any other physical or mental trait. If you have confidence in what you are doing, you will succeed.	1
Women of reddit, today I was told I have sexy forearms. Is this a thing? Do women really pay that much attention?	I like forearms. Good forearms tend to be attached to good upper arms and good hands and...yeah, well, you know. Anyway, I'd guess that the complimenter was trying to say something nice but not sleazy or weird about you.	Strong arms in general are incredibly sexy and a huge turn on. I know a lot of girl who feel that way.	0
Women of Reddit: What are some things that guys worry about or have insecurities about that most women don't care about?	Sexual stamina. Seriously I would much rather have a quickie, then some time spent on me, then another slower shag when the guy's recovered. There's nothing fun in lying there while a guy pumps away diligently, evidently doing his times tables to keep from coming. I WANT to turn you on. I WANT you to be so excited and pleased by me that you can't handle more than a few minutes. In time, when you get used to each other, you can take things slower. And obviously there's a cut-off point where it can get a bit exasperating, but just make sure you put the time in in other ways. The whole "I can last 45 minutes!" thing doesn't really help most girls out much. Porn is lying to you.	I have always been attracted to bald men (shaved heads, whether they still grow a full head of hair or not) and find chest hair really attractive. I don't want to date a boy, I want to date a man, and the vast majority of men have chest hair. I think it's sexy. Embrace who you are and be confident about it. That's the sexiest thing of all. And if you're self-conscious about sparse hair on your head, just shave it all. It makes most men look younger, anyways.	1
A couple of months ago I was talking to a girl who thought that men were just being pussies when it came to being hit in the nuts. After she said that, some of females in the group nodded in agreement. How common is this belief among women?	I don't think that's true at all, the girl was either stupid or egging you on. We have a fraction of the nerve endings you guys do down there and I've been kicked pretty hard in the crotch (by a younger brother). If they hit a certain spot it's agony, and I know you guys have it worse. It is ridiculous that this girl said that, I've seen men throw up after being hit in the balls.	**Edit - that didn't really respond to your question... I really don't think it's a common belief among women. I'm generally of the camp that I'll respect your pain as long as you respect mine.**	1
I've been told men are more confusing than women. So what is the most confusing thing you experience men do?	Why can't you plan ahead and multitask?? Do you need to wait for the morning of your business trip to wonder if your suit is clean? To pack your bag and look frantically for your passport when you should have done all this the night before? Can't you go to the bathroom as I am getting our son's shoes on while you stand there looking at us, instead of waiting until we are in the car and waiting to go? etc...	Why talk to me and act like it's going somewhere when you're going to say "Oh actually, I'm busy and I can't be in a relationship" You *knew* you were busy before you asked me out. Why ask me out? Or maybe just be honest say "I didn't feel that much chemistry...sorry" It would sting a little but piss me off less than doing something illogical. While being in relationships: Not telling me stuff. Not that I need to know every little detail of your day, but when you say "Oh I'll be at your place in 15 minutes!" and you decide to check your facebook, take a shower, play a round of Bloons Tower Defense, and 11:30 turns into 1:15, I get worried. Cut. Dat. Shit. Out.	0
I'm curious about why women moan during sex?	It's like screaming on a roller coaster, you don't *need* to do it, but it feels a helluva lot better to do it.	Sex at Dawn believes it's an instinct to lure nearby men over to have Sex after her current partner is spent.	1
Am I a creeper dad if I'm a friend with my daughter's friends (male and female) on facebook?	Female mid-20s here: You seem to be staying away from the creeper zone. As long as you don't go wandering off and start 'liking' bikini pics of her friends, you're in the clear. I like how you've been pro-active in having female friends over when there might be any chance of creeper allegations. (It sucks that society is super suspicious of Dads though.)	If I was in your position, I would make it a requirement for her even being allowed to have a Facebook account. You are a single parent, and your daughter is only 16, you SHOULD be keeping an eye on what she is doing online, too many kids are getting themselves in trouble and posting inappropriate things that will come back to haunt them when they are adults and have better insight and decision making skills. I get that you are concerned it will look bad because you are a guy. You are completely justified, its disappointing and frustrating that our society is so paranoid that you feel like you have to defend what is basically supervising your daughter just because you are a single father. I doubt it would be any kind of an issue if you were a single mother instead.	1
How do you feel about a guy who asks permission before going in for a first kiss?	Hon, if you have to ask...maybe you should first verbally establish whether or not this person is sexually interested in you and then read up on body language.	My boyfriend didn't quite ask, but when we were on our first date, toward the end of the night, I asked "What do you want to do now?" and he looked me in the eye and said, "Well, I kinda just want to kiss you." We've been together almost a year now.	0
To the single ladies 30's and up, do you wish you settled in your 20's?	I got married last year, right after I turned 21. Ask me in ten years how I'm feeling about it.	Nope. All my friends who 'settled' in their 20s are divorced or unhappy. I'm 46, never been married, had two long term live in relationships, and I love my life. I answer to no one but me!	0
Are there any women out there who can give a first hand account as to why we don't see more of your gender in STEM (science, tech, engineering, math) career fields? What's your personal story?	I don't do it because I'm not interested in it. Quite simple. If I had to guess, though, I'd say it's because women like to have options. We like it when there is more than one answer to a given situation. Men, however, just want 1 answer, because it's much simpler that way. Edit: IMO	There are a lot of women here saying they're engineers because they were told they could do anything a man could and are breaking gender stereotypes but I gotta say, I'm an engineer because I like science. the end	0
Is it irrational that this annoys me?	Your male and female friends are adults and they can do what they like. If they want to hook up or do anything then you don't really have a say in it. That being said it is annoying as fuck when you have friends who put you in the middle of their relationship and pump you for information, or involve you in their casual hook-up drama.	I would find it very disrespectful. My guy friends know that if I bring along one of my girl friends, they can flirt, exchange numbers, plan followup events, but they do not take that girl home. It's obvious that hooking up would cause an awkward situation for me and my friends respect that. Maybe you should talk to the guys and set up some rules? That's what I had to do. It's been working amazingly ever since; however, I'm also very picky about what girls I take out with me.	1
askwomen, Reddit always says don't stick your dick in crazy but they never talk about the opposite. Can you give examples of times that you have let crazy stick his dick in you? how did it change you?	I hate the phrase don't stick your dick in crazy. I find it full of gendered problematic language, reducing a woman that you had a problem with to one adjective, a though men do not have equal diagnosis of this disorder.	I've been with a few when I was younger. I learned to stop ignoring the red flags that come with an emotionally unstable partner. One resulted in a restraining order and another had me fleeing the state in the middle of the night- I was going to be moving anyway, but a particularly bad night prompted me to throw all my shit in the car and book it a week early. I'd really rather not go into details. Controlling and abusive behavior is no joke regardless of gender. If your partner is displaying the signs (unfounded jealousy, isolating you, tearing down your self esteem, ensuring control over your money, wild accusations) get out no matter how much you think you love them, or how fun they can be or if it's only when they're drunk. Your partner is supposed to enhance your life, not make it frightening and miserable.	0
I feel that my girlfriend is insensitive to the fact that I don't want to hear the details of her sexual history, but she accuses me of slut shaming. Am I in the wrong?	Dude maybe the slut thing is part of who she is and she wants to be able to share that with you. Some people can see sex as a hobby. A fun activity to engage in, sometimes with strangers, always enjoyable. She doesn't necessarily see *all* sex that way, but she seems more capable of looking at a sexual relationship very casually than you are. It's okay to be either way. You gotta talk to her about it from that angle, rather than an I'm-right-and-you're-wrong angle, to reach an acceptable compromise.	I am a pretty imaginative person so when I hear something I tend to imagine it. I would not be able to take it if the person I was dating made me constantly visualize them having sex with another person. It has nothing to do with disapproval for their actions or choices in the past or future - I just don't want to think about that stuff! Think of it this way: Everyone poops. Do I want to hear the details of your last poop, the image, the smell, the size, how great it felt afterward? Hell no! Does this mean I'm shaming you for pooping? Um, no.	0
Do women check out men?	Oh I do it ALL the time. I love looking at men. I just don't make it obvious like you guys do. Question for you: would you *like* for a girl to make it obvious? Edit: the men have spoken! I've decided to make it more obvious when I check guys out. I'll try not to be creepy. ;)	Excuse me for commenting in the subreddit, but may I suggest that you start lifting weights and dieting. If you're dedicated by this time next year you will be getting checked out and likely *asked out*. Source: Personal experience. Again, sorry for not being a woman and commenting!	1
Is my job a turn off?	Guy here, if a woman you meet asks your profession just tell her it's a bit strange to most people and you don't like to talk about it until you know the person better. This will intrigue them, women love a bit of mystery. When you do tell them, don't be the least bit embarrassed, be proud of what you do and emphasis the emotional aspects rather than the technical. Assuming it's true, talk about wanting to help people come to terms with the loss of a loved one.	Best thing I can tell you is that it's not about the job, it's about your presentation. Think of it like a resume. You probably don't want to go around telling the girl you're dating how much ass it kicks to embalm corpses all day because she won't "get it." Just say, "actually, it's not that bad" and mention that it pays well or whatever. Try to ease her into it by not letting the subject stay up for too long at a time in the earlier points.	0
I (male) am spooning with you, a female friend, I develop an erection. Women; can you tell?	Yes, but I would be more concerned about the random boners you get when you're sleeping. Nothing like rolling over and being poked.	Listen, ain't nothin' wrong with a good ol' fashioned spoonicorn. That being said, yes, we can tell, if you press it against our warm, soft, lovely female bodies. If you choose to leave a gap, a boner gap, we will be none the wiser.	0
Fellow ladies, can we talk about this men-must-be-confident thing?	Fun fact: self-deprecating humor is the most attractive type of humor. It shows that you're comfortable enough in your own skin that even you can make fun of you.	I'm an introverted female. Alpha guys were like a blowtorch to my candle. I got with another introvert and we lived happily ever after. We would never have found each other in a bar or a club. I think the way we look for partners in screwed up. We've set up a system where the alpha men and women have a great time partying and finding each other and the rest of us are left feeling like lonely failures. Get out of the bars and live your life doing what you enjoy. Look around at the others doing the same thing. They are your best dating prospects.	0
What are girls doing in the bathroom pre-sex?	taking a piss then whipping her Vag very very clean. Garunteed and if she's an out of the box thinker -2 pinches on each breast	We're peeing. It's really difficult and frankly a little scary to orgasm if you need the toilet. A quick freshen up can't hurt either. Vaginas are complicated.	0
What made you realize you were in love with someone?	You know that feeling you had in your stomach on Christmas morning? You know everything is okay and you feel excited, happy, content and even a little bit sad for some reason? When I looked at my boyfriend and felt that feeling, I knew I loved him.	If everyone else in the world suddenly died except you two would that be: 1. Sad 2. Perfect If 2, you're in love	1
what is the worse absolutely most dreadful sex story that you have?	Met a random at the bar. Went back to my place and we spent all night having sex. At one point, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up a bit and prepare for another round. When I came out, he was squatting naked in my kitchen, a bottle of olive oil on the ground next to him, and his fist shoved up his own ass. Awesome for him for knowing what he wants. Not so awesome to (1) surprise me with it and (2) use my fucking food to get it done.	When my ex and I had first gotten together, we moved into her mom's one bedroom duplex. Well, my ex's brother and his family were visiting from out of town so my ex and I were sleeping in her mom's room *and* bed for the night. I was under the blanket going down on my ex, her mom opens, the door, comes in and says "Oh, looks like you two are having fun." She turned right around, left and shut the door. My ex immediately started crying. **TL;DR** - My ex's mom walked in on me going down on her daughter while we were sleeping in her bed.	1
Women - if your date/boyfriend is threatened in public to the point where a fight is inevitable, what would you want him to do?	A fight is never inevitable. The best reason to stay in shape is so you can run the fuck away.	I would want my date to try to de-escalate the situation if possible or try to extricate himself from the situation. There's nothing sexy to me about fighting.	0
From reading all the the threads about approaching, the conclusion is that most girls are not very thrilled to be hit on by strangers. My question is, how did you meet your last boyfriend?	Met husband through friends, never got close until he started calling me and asking to hang out. Friends for a while, sex ensued, love got to us. Im one of those women who hate strangers. I have several very uncomfortable experiences from strangers approaching me, often drunk, and behaving offensive. I prefer the company of friends when meeting new people overall, just the way i work.	I met my current SO in school. I tried to ask him out a week earlier then chickened out. A week later I was going to hand him a note asking him to dinner and a movie but I chickened out and left it in my pocket. Later that day he asked me out to dinner and a movie. I took the note out of my pocket and wrote my number on it and said yes. (I saw that he kept the note, its in his safe. He's had it for 9.5 years now).	0
Ladies, have you ever been with a man where you've actually been attracted to his natural scent?	I love my husbands natural scent. Its soothing, in a way. Cuddling up to him is home for me, its warm and inviting. I like to lay by his armpit and fall asleep there because I feel so calm. Ok, that was weird to type.	I always wondered this. When I played football I remember coming out of practice with only my morning deodorant, its now 9:30 at night. I had girls just going crazy over my sweat drenched body. I had a wet t-shirt and wet hair all from burning hot summer days and eighter my gf or others would flip to dirty sex machines. Now I felt bad for being so dirty but they said I smelled amazing. Could it be pheromones?	1
Dear sisters of reddit, I am the older sister to a 13 year old girl and I desperately need advice. Please help?	I'm not female, and I'm not a parent, but does it ever work to call bratty little girls on their crap and not let them weasel their way out of immaturity? As in, 'you're being disrespectful, you have no good reason to, and you know it. cut the shit and act like the age you want to be treated.'	As an older sister to a real crazy one, I can say that you have to appreciate the shit out of her good moments and do your best to ride out the bad ones. It can be hard not to take it personally when she takes shit out on you, but remember that she loves you and she's just high on puberty hormones. Though my sister is almost 19 and she's still a nut case half the time. edit, more advice: Don't try to involve yourself in her bullshit- if she's being crazy, steer clear. It's sort of a big-sister-ly instinct to want to help her with her problems but sometimes it's better to not get involved. If she comes to you with something, that's one thing, but otherwise you should offer your opinions on her life sparingly.	0
Do you self-identify as a feminist? Do you believe in equal rights for men and women? If so, do you like being taken out on dates where the man pays?	I consider myself both a feminist and a MRA. I like most people and I think all people should have equal rights. Anyway - Sure, I like being taken out on dates when the man pays. I also like other dates where I pay for the man. Going dutch is also acceptable. I'm fine with a man being the primary earner in a household. I've lived with two men in the past and I was the primary earner in both situations, so I haven't really encountered living with a man who makes more than I do. I don't think paying for dates or earning more money is condescending to one party or the other. Some people are better able at some skills and some are better able at others. Sometimes those cross traditional gender lines and sometimes they don't.	I without a doubt self-identify as a feminist (as all women really should, but that's neither here nor there). Who doesn't believe in equal rights, honestly? If I am asked out on a date, then he should pay. That being said I have NO problem paying for myself, and wouldn't think any less of a man if I paid. If the man is the primary earner and the woman is okay with that, as in she doesn't want/need to work, than that's fine. I only take issue when women aren't "allowed" to work, or are called bad wives/mothers for working.	1
Are there women out there who truly believe that victims of rape should be denied the ability to have an abortion? If so, why?	A life is a life even if it is spawned from a terrible deed it should not be punished for that. /end The type of person op is looking for. That view is rarely seen on reddit so I thought I would help you out. =p *fixed a word.	1) religion 2) caring more about your tax rate then the rights of your fellow man edit- try as you may, but downvoting me isn't going to make Romney win Ohio. FACED!	1
As a guy, I can detect assholes from miles away and in seconds. So...ladies who keep ending up with assholes - are your radars really that bad or do the benefits(confidence) really outweigh the costs?	It's not a radar thing. It's genetic. The most confident guy is the one people attach to. Sometimes they turn out to be assholes, sometimes not, but it's usually the leader of the pack, rather than someone who's really nice, but not an alpha.	I'll start out by saying it boils down to having a bad radar. BUT assholes are really good at being really nice to women at first. You don't see them in private with us--and you probably would never guess how cool and sweet some "assholes" can be. It throws off the radar.	0
Hey, fellow ladies. DAE have a hard time letting rampant sexism in Reddit go?	Reddit's sexism is exactly why I won't post pictures of myself with my "real" account anymore. The most karma I ever got with that account was from a picture of me that (shocker!) happened to include my breasts (low-cut top; nothing obscene). While it received tons of upvotes I found the comments infuriating. Accusations of being a whore of one type or another, degrading/immature comments about my chest size, and lots of downright creepy comments. I had to scroll down more than half a page before anyone even mentioned the purpose of the photo (I had met a semi-celebrity and it was a picture of me standing with him). I find reddit a lot more enjoyable now that I never even mention my gender on my real account anymore.	I don't have much problem with sexism, but more with the thinking of a huge mass of young people with very little wisdom. These youngins will simmer down as they get older. However, I love being around and talking to younger people, because they are often so full of exciting ideas and hope. Now get off my lawn.	1
Breaking the bad news: how do I bring up hygiene/weight issues with the ladyfriend?	> Can we however agree that physical fitness is always a positive development though? Well, you didn't say "physical fitness." You said *weight.* And then you clarified by saying her ass is getting big. Please don't insult the larger sized women of reddit and please don't lie to yourself. You don't mean "healthy" and you don't mean "physically fit." You mean what you said - that you want her to lose weight.	Not showering-to me that seems like she is in a fairly severe depression if that is not like her. Try to pull her out of it, find out what you can do to appease the depression. When she comes out of it, the rest could likely fall into place. When we feel good about ourselves, we treat ourselves well. When we don't, well we don't shower or take enjoyment from the things we used to. You are talking about treating the symptoms for your comfort instead of helping her with the cause. Don't just put bandaids on it. If you help her fix the cause, it will make your relationship that much stronger and wouldn't you prefer that she is happy, healthy, and triumphing over her depression and stress, instead of proposing she look and smell sexier for you?	0
Ladies, how many of you are dating someone that's not your physically ideal man? Do they know? How does it make them feel?	My current bf is the first white guy i've ever dated. He always knows that he's not my "type". He also knows that I think he looks old (there's quite an age gap between us, and I look young for my age). I think he does feel conscious from time to time, but I've made it clear that although i don't think he is that good looking, I'm still hugely attracted to him physically. And he's pretty comfortable being who he is so it's not really a big deal. One time I teased him about his look and he said "Don't try too hard to make me feel unattractive. I'd hate to see you fail."	Honestly, I was pretty meh about men with beards until I met my boyfriend. My tastes changed real fast. Also, dating my "ideal physical man" <<<<< dating a guy I'm attracted to on a number of levels. To sum up, dating my physical fantasy does not matter and has no real effect on my relationship.	0
How common is this thought amongst friends?	Sounds like you're a nice guy. I might think your actions were a sign of your romantic interest if you didn't do nice things for other people, but I would probably believe you if you said you two were just friends.	It sounds like you're trying to get in her pants, but if you aren't, fine...I think the real question is 'So what if you're trying to get in her pants?' It's none of their business.	1
Ladies, has a guy ever done something that made you want to dump him on the spot?	Watched him beat his cat. (for scratching on the furniture i think). Not just a tap on the nose, he punted the little guy across the room. Cat seems like he's used to this, but its no wonder he's terrified of people! I left AND i reported him for animal cruelty. NO clue if anything came about it.	He was a veteran, and my friends and I have a sort of interesting sense of humor. My best friend and I high fived over not having kids (both got abortions in the past), he just turned to me and said "Wow, I've taken lives overseas and I can't believe you guys are celebrating killing a life". I honestly should have dumped him on the spot, but he ended up breaking up with me a week later. I have no idea what I was thinking when I was actually upset about it.	1
Should men be entitled to a "legal" abortion?	Men ARE allowed to sign documents absolving themselves of (at least financial) responsibility, though the woman in question needs to be on board. This is a thing that happens. But what's really at the heart of this: it's not fair because biology's not fair.	I agree with OP. Men should be able to sign a document absolving themselves from financial obligation. It's not fair that they could get stuck with a child they didn't want in the first place. If the mom wants to keep the baby, good for her, but she better be willing to pay for the kid on her own.	1
African American Male Here. How many of you women out there are just completely not attracted to African Americans?	it depends on a guy! yesterday i saw the most beautiful/cool looking guy ever and he was black. edit: though i had stuff stolen by black guys so now i'm afraid of them, it depends on how they dress now. though a lot of black ppl live here.	British white woman here. I'm as likely to find a nice man with dark skin as attractive as a nice man with light skin. The key for me, personally, is the "nice man" bit. Having said that, a person's culture has an effect. I'm much more likely to be comfortable around and actually act on an attraction with someone who has similar cultural background to me (eg, Dark-skinned guy born and raised in London, yes - dark-skinned guy born and raised in Kenya, probably not).	0
What's it like being pregnant?	I'm 7 weeks pregnant and so so so fucking miserable. It feels a lot like having the flu or food poisoning with no chance of letting up for at least a month. I feel so sick and completely exhausted no matter how much I sleep. Even though the pregnancy was planned and wanted, emotionally, I'm a wreck. I wanted 3-4 children but I am not sure I can do this again in the future.	I found it quite surreal that PEOPLE ARE LIVING INSIDE YOU. They move, strech, kick and have hickups. They like or dislike your music (you're able to feel the difference), so they've even got their own taste. And the moment they get out is even more surreal, but after that they stop feeling like an alien and start just being a baby.	0
I have a daughter with another on the way. What is the one thing your Dad did right/or wish your Dad did?	I have nothing to add in terms of fathering advise, but you may want to research a bit more in-depth. Delightful anecdotes from internet commenters are fine, but child-rearing is obviously a pretty broad and complex topic. Doubtless, there are hundreds of quality books in this area that are not 'hippy new age bullshit.' This is probably a good question for a research librarian, actually.	My dad loves the crap out of me. That makes all the mistakes I can see as an adult ok. * He remembered to change how he treated me as I got older by gradually treating me more as an equal. * He is always gracious to new boyfriends. * He always encouraged me into math and science but never made it about me being a girl. Instead it was all about bettering my future.	0
Women who have taken a guy's virginity, Could you tell and did they tell you?	My boyfriend and I took each other's virginities and we both knew the other was a virgin. It was cute because he was very nervous and had a hard time getting it up and it just made it worse when I screamed in pain when he tried to get in (I told him to go slow! xD). Then when he did get in he kinda humped but didn't really know to go in and out, and then he lost it again within a couple minutes. We had the courage to try again later that day and it was a lot better. It may not have been the best first time but I thought it was really adorable that he had no idea what to do and it was really special because I got to share it with the person I am going to spend my life with.	I took my husband's virginity. He told me before hand. He had some issues at first getting too nervous to perform, but we worked through his issues together. The only reason I could tell was that he had some issues staying hard in the beginning, but, once we got going, I couldn't tell he was a virgin at all! Gentlemen out there, don't be afraid to be honest with a girl about your virginity. If she is bothered by you being a virgin, then she isn't worth giving your V-card to.	0
Reddit Women! Unmarried man[37] will be having his daughter[16] stay with him for a while. The catch is, we haven't seen each other since she was 5. Bonding suggestions?	Don't mention the aunt's involvement. Just say that the lawyer told you they had reason to believe the test wasn't accurate so you were asked to do a new one. All those years you were gone were because her mom said you were not her father and asked you to bow out of their lives. DNA backed her up (although you now know it was inaccurate) so you did as she asked believing it was in their best interests.	um instead of setting out to bond...just try to hang out. She is a grown up at this point, at least in her own mind, if you treat her that way she will appreciate it. Feel free to have open adult conversations with her that are full of truth without casting aspersions or blame. She will have questions, try to answer them. Let her know that her family was under a lot of stressors and did the best they could under the circumstances to do what was best for her and for themselves.	1
Do women know when they're being handled by a wingman?	Yes, and we don't necessarily mind as long as the guy is friendly and doesn't try to pretend like we can't figure it out. Your best bet is to both engage both of us actively in conversation so it feels less contrived. If you and your friend are both nice to me, I'll probably wingman for you a little when we inevitably do a bathroom retreat to discuss it. If your wingman is the only one talking to me and you are trying to separate us too soon, I am going to shut it down. She came with me, and we probably have a plan to split a cab or an agreement not to leave each other alone, and I will enforce it if I don't like the way it's being handled.	I would think anyone who uses a "wingman" is a coward, and I wouldn't be interested in anyone who doesn't have the balls to come up to me and speak to me directly.	1
Do you enjoy just the presence of your SO while you are doing work?	Yes, a thousand times yes. Work can sometimes be frustrating, so being able to look up and see him there cheers me up immensely and helps me continue. He hates working when I'm there, though. He finds my presence very distracting... not because I'm being obtrusive, but because he keeps remembering the more fun things he could be doing at the moment.	I absolutely hate being around my SO. They are immature, irritating, interactive, and unsymapthetic to my needs. I cannot relocate my computer because they will complain that I no longer love them, and I can't go to the library because they want to come too. Clingy SO is clingy.	1
Have you masturbated to most of your male friends?	I don't know what kind of bros you hang out with, but as a male I can say that I have masturbated to maybe 10% - or less - of my female friends. They're *friends* for a reason, and if I wanted them for anything more, I wouldn't consider them a friend. I'm guessing that, for women, it's 0%.	Nope. I've never thought about any of my friends. Guys I'm dating/sleeping with, yes, but friends no. My mind just doesn't go there.	0
Ladies, do you find Reddit to be a sexist environment?	I've found it generally pretty hostile. The amount of casual and "ironic" sexism and misogyny that gets tossed around on most of reddit is pretty ridiculous and I find that female voices/experiences/opinions are generally dismissed or ridiculed. AskWomen is heavily moderated for that reason. Most people don't see the majority of the offensive shit that we have to remove here. Or the threats and misogynist rants that target us moderators. So even in trying to run a less sexist space comes with a great deal of having to put up with sexist bullshit.	Ummm....Not to be different but no. There are plenty of individuals who make comments that are uncalled for, but I personally have never really felt offended or anything. I also have never felt that things were hostile. Maybe I hang out in only good areas.	1
I often see the "we're raised to avoid conflict/be nice" message often when women respond to questions that center around why they aren't often direction with their intentions. How do I avoid this when raising my daughter?	I'm not female, but I can recommend Tamora Pierce for kids' books with healthy feminism. The Lioness quartet that starts with Alanna: the First Adventure features a great story that has a lot to say about gender roles.	I think one of the the best way for her to learn about confrontation would be to see it modeled in the home. As in, if other members of the family engaged in healthy, assertive communication in front of her. Then she will feel safe doing the same at home and eventually anywhere. Growing up, I never had a good model of assertiveness and was conditioned to not have a voice. As a result, I'm usually drawn towards very outspoken, assertive people and thankfully they helped me learn to have a voice. Sounds like you are doing a good job so far and it makes me happy to see a dad so caring and involved.	1
My girlfriend seems to love attention from other guys. Is this normal? Harmless?	I'm really curious as to why her number of sexual partners / *kissing* partners (are we 16?) are remotely involved in this. You should edit that info out, it's irrelevant and I immediately assumed you were a controlling D-bag.	If it's making you feel uncomfortable, she knows that it makes you feel uncomfortable, and she continues to do it...it's not harmless. That's immature, and disrespectful. If she feels like she has to hide things from you, that's cheating. Period. Let her know you don't like her flirting, "harmless" or not, and if she continues, dump her. She can apologize until her lips fall off, but it's obviously not genuine if she keeps doing it. Actions are stronger than words, and this is a fine example. I wouldn't put up with any more if I were you. *ninja edit* >Some girl friends of mine told me that a little flirting is harmless True, flirting here and there is just human nature. However... >has told me she's gotten numbers, but not who from, to get a rise out of me when she hasn't. Not okay.	0
Ladies, what action or issue in a relationship is pretty much an instant dealbreaker for you? Any particularly unusual ones?	if he lies, i should have walked away then because that was the only truth he ever told me. That he lies even when he has no need. So whenever we had a serious convo i would always ask if he's lying. I felt like he never did lie, until they all unraveled. Silly me thinking I would be the only person he wouldn't lie to..	A guy who harms an animal on purpose. That's not unusual though. I can deal with a lot of common things, weird likes and dislikes. I may joke about some things like, "If you like that band, we're done!" but I never mean it.	0
What preconceptions did you have about men which you later learnt weren't true?	1. That a guy could want a marriage more than I do! (my current situation right now). I used to think all of them didn't want to settle down, be a bachelor forever, etc. 2. That ALL of them grow overwhelming chest/back/leg/butt hair after a certain age (not the case at all) 3. That they're terrible cooks, excluding "professional chefs" of course... see above. Probably reinforced by my local culture, where men don't really cook at all. 4. That a man could be into shoes/fashion more than any woman I know (that's my brother) 5. That they are all more assertive/less introverted than me. However, all the guys I've liked were far more shy than I am!	The first time I saw a penis in real life (my current boyfriend) I had no idea what a "grower" was, or that they even existed. So my reaction in my head went from "It's not that big but that's ok" to "OH OK NEVERMIND".	0
Jumping off the "period shits" thread--Ladies, what are some body issues no one ever warned you about (and that men don't even know they don't know about)?	My big one is that no one ever fully explained discharge to me. For a long time I thought there was something wrong with me because my underwear was always gross and crusty at the end of the day.	Thankfully for me, nothing odd has ever really happened to me. I don't have to worry about being regular, as I've been right on the dot since my first period. The only thing that no one warned me about was how damn horny I'd get the week before my period. >_<	1
Do I need to specify I'm asking you out on a date?	Depends on the context. If you are friends and regularly hang out with this person in non-date situations, then you should probably say that it is a date. If you met on an online dating site, everyone probably knows that it's a date.	you can always end with "great, it's a date" when she agrees. that will get the message across in a less blatantly obvious way.	1
What has made you decide to break off a previously close friendship?	Reading this thread I'm starting to understand now how a girl I was friends with initiated a "falling out" that I was completely unaware of and transitioned to just talking crap behind my back. I still don't really know what happened and consider myself fairly conscientious of others. Sometimes people do things and don't realize they've hurt or upset you. The least you can do is try not to overreact and not judge their actions purely based on your perception of how you should be treated. It's one thing if you've brought whatever bothers you to the person's attention and give them a chance to make it right. But communication is overrated I guess. This statement does not apply to situations where the person clearly wronged you and was unapologetic.	Money. I lent her money I had earned at my $7 per hour job so she could buy textbooks and wouldn't have to drop out of college. She dropped out anyway, and I never saw that money again.	0
My last boyfriend told me that I am a bit immature and annoying. I don't agree, but hey, I could be wrong. Ladies, what are characteristics of mature, non-annoying, responsible adult women?	This thread is basically an example of the immaturity. Who turns to the Internet for personality advice? We don't know you, and don't know your ex. I think it's immature that you would ask randoms on Reddit for input where we obviously have zero expertise. But hey, I could be wrong.	Mature: You keep your promises, or apologize sincerely if you don't. You don't lie. You don't try to "cute" your way out of trouble. You generally take care of yourself and don't expect someone else to clean up after you (either physically or emotionally). You understand that your actions have consequences and deal with those. You can productively spend time by yourself. You don't "need" to be in a relationship or company all the time.	0
Is anyone else super turned off when men list "not crazy" as one of their requirements for a romantic partner?	Yes, because it's tacky. It gives me the impression that he sits around with his buddies and talks about how 'bitches be crazy'. If we have a disagreement, I feel he'd be more likely to dismiss my viewpoint on the basis of that I'm a woman, and women are certified psychos. I try to see people as individuals. If a guy has a not-so stellar moment, I don't automatically assume he's a jerk or an asshole. I don't want people making assumptions about me based on a characteristic that they think is inherent to my gender.	I think it's perfectly reasonable. I'm a lady and listed "no scumbags" on my Internet dating profile. I'm just tired of dating scumbags and I'm sure most dudes are tired of dating batshit crazy ladies.	1
Where do you fall on the scale of [Ugly &lt;---&gt; Beautiful], and how do you know?	I'm a ten. I know this because everyone is a ten. Beauty is completely subjective. One person's "2" is always going to be someone else's "7". i know for a fact that I'm a ten for some people out there, so that's the number I go with.	Somewhere deep down I know I'm well above average looks-wise. I know this because of the way society has treated me since puberty. But when I look in the mirror I see Quasimodo.	0
How do you ladies move on?	There's no easy solution or one way to do this. After my last major breakup it took me months to move on. But once I took that first step, I was able to keep going from there. The first step is the hardest, it depends on how far removed from your last situation you are.	The last time I went through a very painful breakup, I knew I'd be seeing my ex in public not long after. I wrote a list of everything I didn't like about him, as nitpicky and shallow as possible. In reality I loved him and couldn't stand living without him, but on this list I was brutal. As I rode the subway the day of our meeting, I read over the 30+ things on the list, stuff like "gross toenails" and "wears stupid hat." It helped.	0
Who has some jokes?	A woman walked into a bar. "What'll it be?" Asked the barkeep. "I'll have a double entendre." She said. So he gave it to her.	A woman walks into a bar with her giraffe. After drinking heavily, the giraffe passes out. As the woman stands up the bartender shouts, *"You can't just leave that giraffe lying there like that!"* To which she replies, "It's not a **lion**, it's a **giraffe**!"	1
Do you ever worry that you just might not find an SO for the rest of your life?	Nope. That's what cats are for. Edit: I got down voted for a cats comment? I thought this was Reddit.	Yes. I just try to make my life rich and full and rewarding so that I can be a good partner if he shows up.	0
Have you ever dated or met somebody who you wish you had met later in life?	I just broke up with my girlfriend about 30 mins ago. She's amazing. I love her so much but I'm 21 and I want to live my life a little before I settle down into something serious.	My ex and I broke up after 5 years not so long ago. We are in our early 20s and our paths just started to drift apart. I think he is a great guy, one of the greatest persons you can meet, but he has a lot in front of him since he is still looking for himself. I wonder how would it work out if I meet him later in life, but I am grateful for the time we had. He was the right person at that point and helped me achieve all I am today. If we meet later perhaps we would never have that time together we did, because we grew up so much at that shared time. I am sorry we didn't work, but I am happy for all the great moments we had while still at the start of our grown up lives.	0
Guys seem to complain about being in the "friendzone" more than women. Do you think men want to date their opposite sex friends more? Or do they just complain about it more often?	They complain about it more. They think that kindness and friendship buys them pussy and get pissed when they don't get what they think they're entitled to. I liken it to a spoiled child in a toy store whose mom told him no. Edit: I don't know why you guys have jumped all over me when I am not the only person who has expressed this opinion in this thread.	I think the whole 'friendzone' issue stems from the differences in how men and women approach friendships. For women, friendship means emotional intimacy. For men, friendship is less about sharing feelings and more about just doing things together. So when a man puts time and effort into developing emotional intimacy with a woman and that intimacy is reciprocated, he thinks that means she's interested, when really, that's just how women make friends. So the guy feels like he is was lead on or feels like he is owed a romantic relationship/sex because of the emotional energy he's invested in the relationship. If a woman gets rejected, there's not the same sense of wasted energy because for her, the way the relationship developed is the norm. She's more likely to put the blame on herself for not being up to par rather than on the man for wasting her time.	0
Ladies who don't like a beard on a man... why?	I only suggest an actual full blown beard for a man with a weak jaw line. If he has a solid jaw line, that is one of the things that attracts me to a man the most, then you are hiding it behind a bunch of hair. A short beard/five o'clock shadow/scruff is still sexy though and you can see the jaw line.	Probably the same reason a lot of men don't like hairy legs. Some people just like less body hair. I like beards personally. Or preferably that nice bit of stubble some men keep.	1
Does being called "Ma'am" make you feel old?	Yes. I think it's only happened once for fast food but yuck I don't like it I'm turning 23 I don't expect to hear that until I'm 30 or older!	I grew up in Texas. Around here, calling someone ma'am is the polite way of addressing any female you don't know. I personally find it a little off putting when people react unpleasantly to it - it's like holding the door for someone and having them yell at you.	0
do you have any male friends you would date if they asked?	That's how my husband and I got together. We were very good friends and just always had that spark. Finally got together and it's been wonderful ever since.	No. I don't befriend men I'm interested in. If I'm single, I ask them out, if they're interested we date, if they're not they say "no" and I do not seek a friendship with them. If I'm in a relationship I keep them as only acquaintances, I don't accept invites to things from them and only hang out in group contexts where they are brought along by mutual friends.	1
Have you lost a very close guy friend because he fell for you and you didn't return his feelings?	No because I've dated my friends who had feelings for me. The only time I lost someone's friendship was when he didn't want to date me and did the fadeaway.	Unfortunately yes, and I miss him often. We met in High School and thinking back now, I did flirt and keep him on a string a bit. I knew all along that he had feelings for me but I just couldn't return them. In the end he lost it on me one day (which I don't blame him for), and he wrote me this beautiful letter afterwards but asked me to respect him by never contacting him again. I read the letter once and a while, and I saw him in a local shop for the first time in years the other day. He dodged out and I just left it. He will make a woman incredibly incredibly happy one day. I'm sad I didn't meet him later in life, I think our friendship could have lasted if I was more mature.	0
What's a sex dream you've had that you wish was real?	M Shadows is very yummy. I've had dreams about him, as well as Timothy Olyphant &amp; Tom Hiddleston. Tom Hiddleston &amp; M Shadows are my two celebrity crushes though.	I had a dream that Cersei from Game of Thrones made me go down on her. Jury is still out on that one.	0
Ladies, what is one thing your boyfriend does that you absolutely love?	He's not my boyfriend yet, but the guy I've been seeing is hilarious. If I'm ever in a position where he can see my butt, he will grab it and then start biting all over, just little love bites. It always makes me giggle and scream and I love it.	My husband regularly will pop up in bed in the middle of the night,kiss me and tell me he loves me,then pass right back out. He never remembers it in the morning. Always makes me smile.	0
Fucking hell, I wish today was over. How are you doing, right this minute?	Not super great. Arguing and long talks with MrCirocco, very sick horse, potentially sick dog, a wake to go to on Saturday for a family friend's husband. And lots of work to do. Difficult weekend :(	Emotionally drained. My ex boyfriend passed away on Monday and his wake is tomorrow. My heart broke knowing someone I used to love is no longer there anymore Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words. I attended his wake and it was very hard to be there. His mother was happy to see me again and her and his aunts found comfort because my ex had cared for me so much they were happy to have me there. It's been a rough week.	0
Ladies, in highschool did you want sex just as much as the guys did?	Yes! But I wasn't that interested in my fellow high school students, so I ended up not dating very much. I had a lot of fantasies about being older and finally allowed to go after the kinds of people I found attractive.	Oh totally. I had to talk my boyfriend into having sex when I couldn't stand it any more. He was really hesitant.	1
What is the most cringe-worthy thing a male has said to you?	I feel like I've posted this before but: "are your pussy lips as big and pink as the ones on your face?"	The guy I was dating earlier this month was into cock worship, and so was I. He sent me a dirty text that was something along the lines of, "Come worship at the temple of my cock." This dude did quite a few cringey things every now and then, but that text took the cake.	1
To married women: Is your husband different from the kind of a man you always imagined to marry when you were younger?	I think I thought I'd marry a Disney character rather than a real man. But my fiance is almost everything I've ever wanted. He's smart, funny, kind, simultaneously really cool and super dorky, fun, strong and handsome. And he treats me like a princess. Actually, maybe I found a Disney character after all.	I never really imagined the kind of man I would marry. I didn't know that I would be so fortunate as to find someone who is so amazing and awesome, but I am very grateful for our life together.	1
Ladies who are/have been babysitters, what are your tips, tricks and advice?	Know CPR for kids. Ask about any allergies the kids might have. Make sure you know any routines (dinner, bath, bed, etc.) so the kids can't con you into staying up late or something. Give them things to do so they don't drive you crazy.	Best babysitting advice I ever got- if the kids are old enough to walk and talk, ask them for a tour of the house first thing. This gives you an idea of what's important to them, makes them feel like you are their friend, and bonus- you get the tour.	1
Girls who've done boob jobs, are you satisfied with the result?	I work in porn so I see a lot of fake boobs and honestly, the majority look fake or unnatural, not just size but shape too. The ones that "went through the nipple" look the most fake. But I haven't really met anyone who is unhappy with them... Some girls have said they have no sensation left, while others say the exact opposite.	My good friend had them done years ago and said they're the best thing she's ever done. They look fabulous! She even has a birthday for them every year and we go out and get drunk in celebration of her amazing boobs.	0
Is your SO your best friend? Does s/he/they need to be?	No, he's not. Not because he's a bad person or anything and I do love him, but I refuse to make someone I'm dating my closest and best friend. It's done damage in the past.	He is one of my best friends and yes, I feel like he needs to be. The friendship element makes it great to be around just doing regular things like shopping. I trust him. I can rely on him. I can tell him anything. He is one of my favorite people. I feel like all of those friendship elements add to the relationship and deepen it.	0
Where do you live and what are the pros and cons?	I live just outside of a decent-sized city in the midwest (of the US). Pros: - Cost of living! My rent is so ridiculously low. - The city is so pro-kids. We have some amazing kid-focused destinations. And the whole culture is very kid-focused. - Lots of fat people (so I don't stand out) - No mountains! I hate mountains. - The summers are wonderfully mild (compared to when I lived in the oppressive I'm-gonna-wear-this-humid-air-as-my-outfit-for-the-day South) - Hardly any traffic (as compared to coastal cities) Cons: - Snow. So much god damn snow. - Potholes. - Such conservatism, it's embarrassing. - No beach. :( - The public transportation sucks monkey balls.	Paris, France. Pros : Beautiful. Easy access to everything I like and need, especially culture. Don't need a car, I walk past Notre-Dame every day, good food everywhere, family and friends around. Cons : Overcrowded. Expensive. Took me a year to find a job again.	0
What is the worst thing you've accidentally said to a guy?	I was sleeping with a guy that was about 7 years older than me and I really liked him. One morning he apologized if he snored too loudly and without thinking I said, "It's okay my dad snores really loud too so I'm used to it."	Not a girl, but my ex and I were talking about my parents' divorce, which they were in the middle of finalizing, and she said "your dad is not as good a parent you think he is, and he's a worse husband". Turns out she had spoken quite a bit with my mom about it and had a biased opinion. She immediately apologized and said that's not what she meant. She never did clarify exactly what she was trying to say... Edit: I think my dad is an awesome person, who never abused me or my mom in any way, shape or form. So my ex's comment was unwarranted	1
Ladies who love ladies: Can you name a fictional female (book, TV or movie) who encapsulates as many of of the qualities you'd like to see in a woman?	Carol from The Walking Dead was my first thought when reading this. I don't really watch many movies or shows with women who are my type I guess. She's super strong and seeing her change throughout the show has been amazing. I love her adaptability and how she doesn't let her emotions take over her actions. Of course, they accompany her decisions, but she uses logic first. She also knows how to laugh and joke to lighten the mood.	C.J Cregg from the West Wing - smart, witty, strong, caring I have a crush on Kaylee from Firefly. And Zoe from Firefly. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore).	0
Is anyone else super excited that Wendy Davis won the democratic primary and is running for Governor in Texas? Are there any other women you are excited to see run for office this year (wherever you are)?	This won't mean much to anyone outside of Toronto, but I am desperately hoping Olivia Chow wins instead of Rob Ford this October. It seems tragically unlikely though.	Davis won't win. She has been outed as a compulsive liar whose "life story" is a complete fabrication. Don't see how you could be excited to have that type of person in charge.	1
As a male writer, and as a film fan, I want to ask you, which women in fiction you think has most accuarately represented you? Which one was most free of clichés, platitudes, preconceptions, missconceptions, prejudices, etc?	You ladies need to read about Alizebeth Bequin from the Eisenhorn trilogy, what a woman! Edit: This is just some reading a friend handed to me one day and it opened up a complete universe based around a board game I do no play. The character is one I will always remember, very well written.	All the women from Parks & Rec. I'm half Leslie and half April, but I want to grow up to be Donna. Even the unlikable characters feel very real in that show.	0
What fictional women do you find completely fake and unrealistic to the point of anger?	I can't remember her name, but the "love interest" in the second Indiana Jones movie. All that woman did was scream. The second movie was nearly unwatchable for a few other reasons but for me, the Shrieking Asswipe was a big reason.	Donna from Dr. Who. I know a lot of fans just love her, but I can't stand her. She's the stereotypical loudmouthed annoying woman to the point that its like nails on a chalkboard just seeing her. It was way too over the top.	1
Women who joined Reddit many years ago: Have you noticed an increase or decrease in misogyny throughout the default subreddits? Has Reddit's attitude towards women changed?	I wonder if anyone is this thread has any statistics to back up claims of misogyny. This thread is just how you feel about this site which isn't evidence of an increase of sexism. If anyone has anything like trending data that would be interesting to see.	Four years ago women were invisible, so misogyny didn't come up very often in threads. I think it's been on the rise just because there are more outlets for peoples hate.	0
Yesterday was the first time in my life I've seen a man breakdown crying. I've never felt so bad for anyone prior to this. Does anyone else relate?	I've not got enough time to read what you wrote, and I apologize for that. I have noticed over the last few months that for myself weakness can be my strength. I think it takes much more strength to be weak than it does to not show weakness in our culture.	People try so incredibly hard to hide our weaknesses from others, I think guys especially are incredibly discouraged from showing vulnerability. It was probably so tough for him to open up like that. Whenever I see another person do something like that, I always just feel in my head like, "OMG I go through those feelings too, you have no idea how much." It's almost like I feel like I've found a comrade or something.	0
I seem to recall some of you have moissanite engagement rings - how are they holding up?	I just wanted to pop in and comment as a geologist. On a 1-10 scale of hardness (10 being diamonds) Moissanite is a 9.5. So it should hold up very well. That is of course dependent on how pure the stone is and that no imperfections exist. Therefore, as long as you use a reputable dealer I think it's a great choice! You'll save a ton of money and it will look gorgeous for the rest of your life. Congrats!	Have you thought about getting a sapphire? Why get something that people will look at and think is a diamond if you don't actually want a diamond?	1
How do I, as a dad, help my daughters grow into happy, healthy sexual beings?	When kids do that in social situations, as a teacher I say, "Ok _____, time to sit properly," or whatever. People can't masturbate in public.	I guess you could let her know that that kind of behavior isn't appropriate for being in public. As for the "wait until you're married" advice that you seem expected to give, just refuse to give that advice. And if your wife decides to, tell your daughters when she isn't around that that advice isn't the only way to live.	1
Older women: what is something that a lot of younger women on r/askwomen don't seem to understand?	This thread, and some of the responses, are ageist. Different people have different experiences, which defines who we are. And the perspective of a young person is no less valid than the experience of an older person. So to say that young people are immature, "don't have life figured out", or "will look back and cringe" is disrespectful and invalidating. I like the idea of this thread, but if think a better thread would be giving all women a chance to give the other women on here some general advice, regardless of age. But to ask "what don't younger women understand?" seems very ageist.	Patience really is a virtue. 22 year old me was never able to sit and wait for the outcome. I had to confront it! Deal with it! Fix it! Right Now! It's amazing how many things fix themselves. It's even more amazing simply acknowledging that maybe it simply isn't any of my business.	0
What is something a guy might say jokingly but it really is annoying to you?	I'm a twin. Making jokes about including my twin in a threesome, or switching from me to her, are a teleportation device to dumpsville.	When they mumble a vaguely sexual joke so that I can't hear it, and when I ask them what they said, they tell me never mind. Doesn't matter if I'm the only one they're talking to and the joke wasn't made for anyone else's benefit. I despise shit like that. If you're going to insult me or make a joke about me, do it outright. LIKE A MAN.	1
Askwomen, what's a question that you wish more people would ask you on a first date?	So, where do you see yourself in 10 years? There is something about hearing a person's dreams that show you a little bit about their character and how driven/ambitious they are. Also it tells you how much they know about themselves and their priorities. There is nothing more unattractive than someone answering to that question, "uh, idk."	"What do you love?". I had a guy ask me this on a date. It was a really broad question but a great one. It's different than the usual "What do you do for fun?" or "Do you have any hobbies?" because those are usually things you "like" not love.	0
Just got rejected again for an interview I thought I nailed. Anyone else stuck in the hellish underworld of unemployment?	If there were younger applicants, the employer will pick them to pay less. Everything is about how they can part with the least amount of money.	Bring your resume to temp agencies! They love getting people with degrees because most of the people who walk in the door have a high school diploma at best. You'll have a rep who works with you to suss out your best skills and connect you with job openings. I've gotten both my post-college jobs from starting as a temp.	0
Ladies that attended your 10 year hs reunion what happened to most of your former peers?	I've only been out of high school for five years, but I feel like Facebook has ruined the surprise of X-year reunions. I *know* what my graduating class has been up to, I *know* who got fat/thin/married/pregnant/etc. Even if I liked any of those people I have nothing to talk about with them because people my age just continually share every minute detail of their lives online.	I haven't been to mine yet, but I went to my husband's reunion a few years ago. We had lots of fun! Most people were really friendly. My husband had a great time since he was one of the more successful people there with a good looking SO. We may have had less fun if those circumstances were different. But I'm not sure I will go to mine. I don't really want to see those people.	1
Women over thirty, what do you regret the most from the ages of 18-25?	I don't know if they are real regrets, because I am VERY happy with my life and path now. But looking back, 99% of the time, anytime that I settled for anything was a mistake. When I didn't fight for a larger salary. Stayed in lackluster relationships. Didn't say, "no" when I should have. Didn't say, "yes" when I should have. Basically, it was me being naive and insecure. Now, I'm more confident and have no problems asserting myself and my needs.	I didn't take advantage of my youth and every other advantage out there. School - I would have stuck with it. Health - I would have developed better habits that would be part of me today.	1
My 30-yr-old daughter just leased a house with a girlfriend. How do I ask/say it's okay if she's gay?	you look dead at her and say "I am proud of you and your choices, if you ever need my help I am here to support you." It's deep enough for her to understand and its not bold enough to make her get embarrassed .	You don't. If it is, she'll tell you when she's ready. As the other commenters suggested, telling her you're proud no matter what will make it an easier conversation for both of you if you need to have it.	1
Women who have lost weight or become otherwise more attractive, how did your life change?	I am a bit depressed at the moment, so I have put on about 5kg. I am heading towards being overweight, but I guess it is a wall to protect myself. When I was skinnier I had more confidence and men treated me nicer, and prettier girls wanted to be my friend. I am guessing it is my confidence as well.	I lost about 70 pounds a few years ago. I had birthed 4 children and had been overweight in some capacity for around 10 years. How did my life change? Everybody thought I *must* be having an affair. Thanks assholes....	0
What are your "my friend is a bridezilla" horror stories?	My best friend's coworker is getting married later this year, and oh, man, this girl's got some problems. She's very religious and "pure," which, if that's your thing, is fine. Whatever. However, she told my friend last week that **she doesn't want anyone at her wedding who was born out of wedlock**. Which includes my friend, who is the daughter of a teen mom.	A few years ago, my best friend at the time invited me to attend her aunt's wedding. The day after I bought a dress to wear to the event, Bridezilla decided to un-invite me for no reason. As a high schooler who saved up the money for the dress on my own, I was so mad.	1
What is your grossest lady story?	I am not a lady. However I have lady friends that talk to me about gross lady things to try and gross me out. We had a conversation about tampons. Apparently when women (or at least these ones) poop, the tampon tends to get pushed out and can drop into the poop filled toilet. I've never had a more imaginative picture of poop and blood clots painted for me... well ever. But damn those girls have a silver tongue when it comes to trying to gross me out.	I'll start. I recently got BV (bacterial vaginosis) and chose to use the gel-form of the medication because my doctor said it was faster. From what I understand this gel, inserted nightly basically kills everything up there and sheds some of the vaginal lining. Because what goes up must come down the medication kind of coagulated in my panties in the morning, no biggie, just shower and move on with my day. After my five day run I decided in the shower I should probably pull out my NuvaRing and check on it. Along with the ring came this giant ball of five days old coagulated medication mixed with what I can only assume to be vaginal lining. It was horrifying.... Thank you for listening.	0
So my [29F] girlfriend's doctor refuses to install permanent birth control on her, but has no problem suggesting that I [29M] should get a vasectomy instead. Thoughts?	Oh, for fuck's sake, just get the vasectomy. It's usually way less invasive than any female equivalent and you won't have to look around for 10 years just to find a doctor willing to sterilise a woman.	I think it is absolute bullshit. When my doctor recommended my SO get a vasectomy instead of me getting sterilized, I told her that wouldn't protect me because we're non-monogamous. Her solution? "You should be monogamous." End of discussion. Uhg.	0
Shouldn't some sexual preferences be examined/questioned? Why do we treat preferences as some sort of sacred cow?	There are sexual preferences that are normal. Being attracted to short/ tall people, small/big people, hair colour, eye colour whatever. Totally normal. Those are fair to be accepted and not judged, but there are two conditions. You cannot treat people you are attracted to better than people you are not attracted to. And, you cannot act like something that makes you attractive makes you better than someone else. That's where problems arise. Now, that being said, some other stuff can be judged. Children, animals are never OK. Not ever. These people should seek help and have help provided for them. Then there are grey areas. Submissiveness and dominance are both acceptable, but only in a consenting relationship with no other underlying issues. People who say that they're only attracted to submissive Asian girls are looking for someone they can take advantage of.	I get pretty frustrated with the amount of men who come into sex-positive, feminist spaces with a whole lot of unchecked male-privilege, and try to dominate the conversation with their ramblings about how proud and unashamed they are of their rape fantasies, and how "normal" and "natural" it is. Fuck you. I'm judging. That is not what sex-positivity is supposed to be about. You're not abnormal or disgusting as an individual for having them, but let's not be an idiot and pretwnd like our sexualities aren't constructed within a patriarchy and a rape culture. How DARE you come into a space that intrinsically attracts a lot of rape-survivors, and then misuse the space like that. That shit is TRIGGERING. The fact that so many men think rape is hot, is a DAMN PROBLEM.	1
What are your favourite uses for coconut oil?	I'm a guy but I stumbled in... I use it as an aftershave and never have razor burn or razor bumps with it. That may help a few of you... I'm leaving now...	I add it to my coffee! It's better if you blend it (it's more frothy) or you can just drop a teaspoon in hot coffee, it'll melt at room temp. The first time I tried it I couldn't figure out how I had spent five hours cleaning the entire house and still had a ton of energy. After doing some research, it turns out that it's great for your metabolism - helps break down bad fats and boosts energy levels.	1
Currently at this moment on a nightmare first date. How'd you mess up on online dating?	Just to point out to all the girls relating all of their horrifying first-date experiences I promise we don't all suck. Just the majority	I talked to a man, online and on the phone, for about three weeks. I was interested and he appeared handsome in his pictures. We set a first date for the upcoming weekend. He got into town Thursday night and talks me in to meeting him for an impromptu dinner. He shows up - with his 6 year old daughter in tow. Ten minutes into the date the little girl 'whispers' in her dads' ear "Daddy, I don't like her. I like Jennifer better".	0
Which brands do you think are expensive because of they actually are better quality and which do you believe people just pay for the the name?	Fender, Gibson, fuck, honestly. Any guitar company that can charge over 5000 dollars for a guitar, really. If it's an acoustic, eh. If it's an electric...no electric guitar needs to cost over 2000$ for it to be top of the line.	Most generic medicines are made by the same companies who produce the name brand stuff. You can buy generic Tylenol made by the makers of Tylenol for a fraction of the price.	0
Why are people going crazy over "Frozen"?	You also have to keep in mind that the movie's been out for awhile, and yeah, there's been hype. So if you were going in expecting the movie to be AMAZING, it'd be hard for it to live up to your standards. You're likely hearing a lot of hype from people who went in expecting it to be average, or hoping they'd enjoy it, and wound up enjoying it far more than they thought they would - hence the excited reactions. I loved it, thanks largely to the sister element to it (I'm very close with my sister), the music, and Olaf. I thought he was adorable.	I really love the music, and I really like Elsa as a character. Elsa, Merida and Mulan stand out as my favourite female leads. She and Merida had no romantic interest whatsoever. Mulan went to war, I think having a love story was fair.	1
I can't fathom what it's like to be loved romantically. Could you describe it to me?	Safe. It makes me feel safe. Which is strange for me because I always feel on edge. It makes all of my running thoughts calm and my body relax. At first, it gives me a kind of euphoria, but as it gets comfortable, it starts to fit right, it becomes a safe feeling.	Its security, peace, happiness, and exuberance. To have that mutual honesty and trust and care is the most freeing thing in the world, and I wouldn't give it up for anything. He makes me happy, he's my best friend and my soulmate. I just feel so content. That no matter what happens to me in the course if my life that I'll always be okay. Being selfless with your love for someone else is so satisfying and beautiful. Everyone deserves that slice of heaven. EDIT: Plus there's no judgement and 100% acceptance and for someone to feel so strongly with you with all your flaws is awesome.	1
Have you ever had a dream that left you overwhelmingly sad once you've woken up ?	My dad died several years ago and there have been rare instances when I dream of him. Those are the worst possible dreams to have. I'll be aware of the fact that he's in my dream and then I'll catch him up on everything in my life as fast as I can and tell him I miss him but then he starts to leave and I wake up crying. I wake up crying because it's a terrible tease to see the person you love alive in your sleep. I'll try to go back to sleep just so that I can see him again but it never works.	Every so often I dream that I can fly like Superman and the disappointment I feel when I wake up invariably casts a shadow on my day. Also for a whole after my last break up I found myself having these really shit dreams where I'd confront him and cry and be lame and shit, and they made me reasonably sad upon waking.	1
Has birth control affected your personality?	It depends on the pill for me. I was on Gianvi (generic version of Yaz) and the only personality side effect it had on me was that I would cry much easier/frequently if I was sad or upset. Overall, it wasn't as bad as it may sound. In January-March of this year, my pharmacist changed my prescription to a different Yaz generic (Loryna) and I turned into a completely different person: raging anger, hysterical crying, suicidal thoughts, the whole gamut. I don't know why two different generics of the same brand name pill gave me such wildly different reactions but within a week or two of stopping Loryna, I felt like a human being again.	It messes with my mood. It's a lot easier to set me off now. I haven't felt this moody since I was 16:\ A week before my period I get really emotional and everything upsets me. Two weeks ago it was my birthday and I was about to start it. I cried because my boyfriend got me cookies and I already had cookies... EDIT: I'd also like to add that it killed my sex drive. Sex is still fun, but I always feel really "meh" about it beforehand.	0
I'm a Big Sister! Trying to find fun things to do with my Little, a 13 year old girl - any suggestions?	Could you cook a fun, healthy meal together? I don't know what your little's family's situation is but my mom mentors a high school student and they often go out for lunch—when they started and the student picked the location it would always be fast food places because that's what she was used to, but my mom's taken her to some more adventurous, healthy restaurants that the girl has really enjoyed. Cooking something could be an "activity" version of that maybe, and I feel like 13 is probably a good age for it.	Is she girly? Are you? Cool girl stuff I totally would have wanted to learn at 13: * How to sew a dress * How to do a bunch of different braids * How to make those cool friendship bracelets with the beads and shit * How to apply makeup (cos maaaaakeovers & selfies!) * Various nail art techniques (dots, stripes, pictures, textures)	1
Ladies, is there an ex that just won't leave you alone?	My ex wrote a book about me. A literal fucking book. Talk about not leaving you alone, *I get to walk into bookstores and see this shit*. I hope this makes you feel marginally better.	my first boyfriend. i broke up with him ten years ago, it was far from an amicable breakup, and he still contacts me. for a while i thought [hoped?] he made another suicide attempt and was successful, because i didn't hear from him for a couple years. but he wished me a happy birthday a couple months ago.	1
At what point did you decide "Fuck it. I'm out." with a shitty friend and why?	When her ideas became extremist propaganda. When the people she had been fighting for became the enemy. When the struggle for free speech became the struggle to silence the opposition. When facts were reduced to opinions. When the feminist became the misandrist.	There's a thing that I do when I am thinking of ditching a friendship. I think about all the times I have gone out of my way to help a person or make them happy. Then I think about the times they have done it for me. I often find that my friends are only my friends because I am generous. I seem to attract people who are selfish and/or needy. If I have a hard time thinking of even a single time they have ever gone out of their way to help me or do something nice for me, I start seriously considering severing ties.	0
Are there penises drawn all over womens bathroom stalls?	Not too many, but sometimes I see them in the crappier bar bathroom stalls. Usually I just see motivational messages "YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL!" or something about pooping.	most public women's bathrooms I've been to don't have anything written on them. maybe the occasional name or quote but really we don't do that kind of stuff.	1
What makes your SO adorable?	he insists on cuddling me all night and pulls me back into him and kisses me if I have a nightmare	My wife is Caribbean and any time she gets excited or emotional her accent gets steadily thicker and thicker as she goes on. When we first met I couldn't understand her, so I would have to interrupt her and say 'English please!' but I started to pick up on it. It was really funny when she noticed this. "Whuh dey tink dey can come in mi yaad!" "Yea, screw them!" "Yea! Wait, you understood that?"	0
Is brushing your teeth a "private" action?	She is gonna have real fun with the next 3 years of dorm life. Teeth brushing i not a private action, I probably would have started laughing.	I hope you started hamming it up by brushing your teeth with your mouth wide open and tons of frothy toothpaste dripping into the sink after she asked you to stop. People like her need a reality check.	1
Social etiquette-wise, what's something you really like when you notice people doing it?	If a man I just met curses, tells an off color joke without knowing that I find those jokes funny, spits, etc. and apologizes. Obviously an apology isn't required (or even expected) but it's nice to know that some men still think it's important to be a gentleman, even in the presence of a woman they don't know.	When someone is adept at introducing people at a social gathering. No awkwardness and it makes everyone feel welcome and comfortable.	0
Women of Reddit, I (27M) want to snazz up my apartment a bit. What do you often find men are lacking in their abodes?	I find that guys tend to leave the walls bare, so you might want to put up some prints/posters to make it look cozier. What does it look like now? It's hard to give advice when I don't know what you're starting off with.	If you do a search I'm sure you'll get some results, this get asked pretty frequently. It always makes me kind of confused when guys ask because I didn't realize furnishing an apartment was that complicated. What do you want in your apartment? (Not what are the bare necessities, what do you want?) Get that stuff.	1
Have you ever "broken up" with a friend?	I generally let my friendships fade, rather than breaking it off immediately. Breaking up with an SO is different because I don't have any commitment with my friends to exclusively be friends with them, so I'm not denying them the ability to find new friends by backing off. There's a different level of commitment with an SO. The only friends I've just stopped dead with are people who were a significantly bad influence. There's no need to make people feel rejected otherwise when you can just feel you've grown apart instead.	Yes I have. My grandmother JUST passed away and I called my bestie because I needed someone non family to talk to and she was my "go to girl." I asked her to come visit because I needed someone and she told me no because she was in a crappy mood because she broke up with her boyfriend. She then kept on and on about them breaking up when I finally told her basically "get over it because she'll get another boyfriend but I'll never have my grandmother back" and I hung up on her. I ended up calling my bestboyfriend (he's like a brother to me, he siblingzoned me btw, im fine with it) and told him all what happened and he was actually more there for me than she was.	1
How many of you won't identify as a feminist despite broadly agreeing with its ideals?	I don't identify as a feminist because first and foremost I am a Christian. Any other -ist or -ism is less important to me in my book. I believe that Jesus gave an example of treating women equally, an example that was very radical for his day. If we truly follow Jesus (not men who use Christianity as a political tool) then feminism/equality will be the natural byproduct. I have also been told on more than one occassion that I "can't" be a feminist due to being pro-life/anti-abortion/whatever.	The main thing I dislike about the word is that everyone has a different definition, there is no consistency. I don't like using it because I have no idea what the other person thinks when they hear it.	0
What are the most common casual forms of sexism you experience?	The posts about people assuming that whoever is in charge must be a man reminded me - 3 times I've had women bosses, their first names were Gillian, Erica and Carol. There was a steady steam of mail / phone and face to face queries for Julian, Eric and Carl.	I wish I had a better answer to this. To be completely honest, the only time I ever truly experienced sexism was when I worked somewhere as the *only* female employee and my authority in my job was often dismissed by customers and the owner. I quit the job and don't associate myself with the owner anymore; any time I experience sexism, I separate myself from it. The Kind of sexism that bothers me most is the kind that people resign themselves to being complacent with and then blaming other people for. Stand up for yourself. At least for me, avoiding experiencing sexism is as simple as separating myself from it when I see it happening.	1
Women who have gotten abortions, what was something you were not expecting/weren't informed about about abortions until you received one yourself?	My friend recently had one and had originally tried the pill but failed so she had to so it surgically instead.	A lot of sources say that after an abortion procedure, you should be fine to go back to work, school, etc the very next day. Honestly, my procedure was fine, no complications whatsoever, but I still took a couple of days off of work... And I still ended up feverish with some infection symptoms, despite my best efforts to rest and recover. The only advice I can think of to offer is to tell her to take time off of life to recover, if at all possible. And if she needs an excuse for work or school, I found that "minor medical procedure" was an excuse that nobody questioned, if only because employers are legally obligated to not question it.	0
Your SO wants to ask your father's permission before you get engaged. Archaic or respectful?	Blessing good, permission bad. I want to be with someone who values family and sees himself becoming a part of mine, but can also make his own choices and realizes that we're starting our own family.	Respectful!! My (ex)husband asked my father and then my grandfather... My father's response was "You know she's a pain in the ass?" Ahh, thanks Dad	1
What's the most unintentionally offensive thing your S/O has said to you?	A month after my mum died, I started my first year at university, obviously in a pretty fragile place. I visited my boyfriend at the time at his college, only to hear when I got upset "Haven't you gotten over it yet?". I was stunned to say the least. Not sure what planet he was on, or what possessed him to say that, but I certainly shouldn't have stayed in his company for a year after that.	My roommates and I were talking about prom and how we spent exorbitant amounts of money. He looks at me and says, "Wow, **ex girlfriend** only spent $60 on hers!" Well good for your fucking ex girlfriend.	1
Inspired by AM, what's the worst injury you've had happen to your vagina?	I fell off a platform at a club and landed spread eagle on the corner. My labia were lopsided for two weeks. Pants were hard.	When I was a young teenager and fairly foolish, I got the great idea once to put hand sanitizer on my vagina. Don't put hand sanitizer on your vagina.	0
Women with a SO whose culture is vastly different from yours: what were some of your cultural learning curves?	I am a french Canadian from Alberta and he is a Quebecois (they don't refer to themselves as Canadians most of the time so ya). Although we speak the same language, the cultures are VASTLY different. He doesn't see a need to celebrate Canada Day or Thanksgiving. He's much more open with his sexuality and comfortable with PDA's and touching my butt in public....where I grew in a conservative province where those things just aren't done in public! His family is very open in general about things where mine are more reserved. So ya, same background from way before but somewhere along the way the culture changed. I'm more "anglocized" than he is.	I'm American, he's German. Maybe not a vast cultural difference between us, but from my personal experience, German directness is not a stereotype. If I were thin-skinned we'd have some real problems. Example: One time we were Skyping and he asked me if I had lost weight. I responded, "No, why do you ask?" Him: "Oh, your double chin doesn't look as prominent as it usually does." THANKS BABE	0
What are your feelings on the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of going braless under your clothes?	I literally have nightmares about being braless. That I turn up somewhere, like work and don't have a bra on underneath my clothing. I feel embarrassed, and just want to go home and put on a bra. I have gone out with a sports bra on instead of a normal bra, or if I'm really tired/sick I'll wear one of those camis with a shelf bra, and wear a hoodie over it so it isn't noticeable. I feel naked and frumpy without a bra. Maybe if I had smaller breasts, it wouldn't bother me. But I don't like the feeling of them just being loose and unrestrained.	Honestly, when I see a woman's nipples showing obviously through her shirt, I think it looks really trashy. The only times I go braless is when I'm wearing a super thick top/jacket (where it really doesn't matter) and am just running out to grab something real quick.	1
Women of reddit who have been to prison, how accurate is the setting of "Orange is the new black"?	My mother in law served a year in federal prison for embezzlement. We discuss the show often, and she actually loves it. She said it is really accurate, and that they way it shows that the system gives absolutely zero fucks about rehabilitation or your well being is the most accurate part. She said that the way that the prison divides itself by race is accurate, but she said she kept quiet and was nice to everyone to avoid trouble.	This show is SO on point. I literally got so many friends in it. I'd like to imagine it is so easy to get sucked in because it is such a foreign environment to us. I do think they have done a lot of research to carefully and perfectly put together the show. It definitely has changed my outlook on prisons.	1
How much do women enjoy sex without orgasm?	I've never had an orgasm, but i still really enjoy sex with my boyfriend because it feels good (duh) but also because of the intimacy	I enjoy the sex itself but without an orgasm I'd get frustrated. Luckily it nearly never happens. I feel really sorry for women that never had an orgasm because I think they're only okay with having sex without it because they don't know what they're missing. And I'm pretty sure every woman is able to have an orgasm. It's just about trying and figuring out how it works for you.	1
What slightly embarrassing thing have you done at work lately?	Saw an older (very well paid) coworker wearing flipflops in the hallway, so I went in to HR asking if flip flops were appropriate attire at work (don't really care, just can't stand the guy). HR lady was wearing flipflops... I'll just go back to my desk...	I work at a library. My focus is youth services. I REALLY try to learn all of the kids names. We are part of a small community and I want them to feel as welcome as possible. I welcomed a kid, thought I knew his name. He responded with "I'm not ______. That's the other black kid."	0
Ladies, has your opinion on abortion changed over the years, and if so, what made you sway more Pro-Life or Pro-Choice?	I've always been pro-choice. I heard too many stories from my grandma about what things were like in the days before birth control. My grandmother had several abortions in the thirties and forties that left her insides so ravaged, it was a miracle that she conceived my dad. A female relative had five daughters, and was very poor. She confided that she had three abortions, mostly because she was afraid of being able to feed the kids she already had. Things are different now. Women have a lot of contraceptive choices, yet having a choice is of utmost importance to me. I couldn't dream of a world where choices are taken away.	I'm pro-life and believe abortion should be illegal in all cases. I used to be indifferent on the matter before realizing the evil of abortion, and the fact that to abort is to kill someone who cannot defend himself.	1
Outdoorsy women of Reddit, how do you deal with the "lady things" when roughing it?	First of all, if you're on the pill, makes things a lot easier, you know when it's coming. make sure you burry everything you use. Honestly it's not as bad as you think... Kind of just gotta realize it's going to be awkward.. Usually whenever I peed, I'd find a tree, squat with my back against it.	I have a go girl which makes peeing easier. Although I did end up getting a mosquito bite on my ass. Definitely practice a lot if you're doing this! I'd say a diva cup is probably a really good idea if you have somewhere with water you can wash it out. If not, just use whatever you normally do and keep that stuff ziplocked!	0
Did anyone else send nude pictures to creepers online as adolescents?	I think it's best I came of age in the 56k days. You want to see a picture? you better have 5 minutes to wait for it to download.	Oh god never. I didn't think of myself as a particularly sexual being until I was like 20 (even though guys would try to hook up with me and I had boyfriends and stuff). Rando dudes would ask and I was always like "lol why"	1
Girls, what's your alternative when you want to eat something sweet (chocolate, candy, ice cream, etc) but want to keep it healthier/less fattening?	I drink a glass of soymilk instead, as soymilk is actually pretty sweet but very healthy and tasty. I also eat fruits instead of those sweet treats. When I'm grocery shopping, I try my best to buy popsicles instead of ice cream because even though the sugar content is crazy high, at least there's vitamin C and whatnot and I feel less guilty.	Smaller portions of the same foods, assuming it's a specific craving. Eating one of those itty-bitty Snickers bars (the ones smaller than fun size) when you want a whole Snickers is more satisfying than trying to trick your brain into thinking a bell pepper is a Snickers bar.	0
Have you ever tried to be sexy, only to somehow fail miserably?	My boyfriend once asked in a sexy voice, "would you like to remove your sweater?" i burst out laughing. He got embarrassed. It's now a joke between us	A girl once told me she made out with Girl the last time she was drink because it was a dare. My response was that ive never drank because i don't see the point in consuming something that causes someone to lose control of their actions.	1
Does anyone else just wear pack underwear everyday?	Yep. All I use is the Fruit of the Loom/Hanes packs ones. They're comfy and inexpensive and last a good long time!	No because I only wear thongs and the VS XS are the only ones that fit my tiny butt :(	1
Men who complain about being single are told to work on self-improvement. Women don't seem to get this advice so often. Why do you think this is?	We get this too, you know. Like someone else said, when a woman gets turned down, she thinks "What's wrong with me?", whereas a guy gets turned down and says "What's wrong with her?" We're taught all our lives that men want nothing but sex all the time. So if he doesn't find you sexually attractive, he's either gay or there's something wrong with you.	Just throwing this against the wall to see if it sticks. If I call my dad and say, "I had a crap day because my boss is being unfair," my dad will try to suggest ways that I can solve this problem. If I call my mother and say the same thing, she will empathize with me and talk to me about how I can resolve those feelings. I wonder if this difference is coming, in part, from where we are getting our advice. If men turn to other men more often, they might get more of the solutions oriented advice. If women turn to other women, then might get more empathy and "You don't need a relationship to be happy" kind of talk.	0
What are some things you've tried really hard to enjoy, or always felt you were meant to enjoy, but eventually decided you just couldn't get into?	Beer. It tastes awful. I can't understand why people enjoy it so much. Maybe I didn't start drinking young enough?	Sports. Why the fuck do I want to sit there for an hour and watch people exercise and while I get fucking fat.	1
What's the most ironic thing about your relationship with your SO?	Our first conversation involved me stating that I had absolutely no desire to be in a relationship with anyone and him informing me that he was completely content with the possibility of being single for life.	We were friends first so of course when we first started talking about sex we only talked about it being fwb. Because friends.	1
What would you add to the list of these 'Women are in Charge of Their Bodies' posters?	Women who don't have kids!! I'm not a selfish sociopath kid-hater who's going to die alone and have my cat eat my face.	I would want to see a dose of reality. Yes, it is your body and your decision, but decisions have consequences. Defying social convention will make you an outsider, and these posters don't recognize that. Each poster takes a piece of femininity and says "you are special and this doesn't apply to you if you don't want it to". But that is a lie. But maybe that is a feature, not a "bug", of the posters? I personally would be progressively unattracted to a woman as more of the poster content were to be cumulatively applied to one person. Maybe a disclaimer is needed at the bottom of the posters?	1
What little quirk do you love about your SO?	His belly laugh is probably the cutest thing on the planet. His face gets all scrunchy and he tries to suppress it and keep talking and then he smiles all the way into his eyes and he laughs like when you shiver and your voice gets all stuttery. It's pretty difficult to get him to belly laugh, so eliciting this reaction is like witnessing an actual miracle.	His white boy dancing paired with the way he'll randomly sing something instead of speak it. "I can't mess up this paint joooob, don't fuck up don't fuck uuuup, aw yeah, didn't fuck uuuuup..." And then he does an absurd butt waggle to seal the deal. He's ridiculous and I adore it.	0
Is "I'm only friends with guys because girls are too much drama," actually a thing?	I went to an all-girl's catholic high school and had a horrible time of bullying, rumors and exclusion, and so I sort of developed this mentality because, in fact, the few friends I had were guys. Now that I'm an adult I've realized this was completely circumstantial and would never even think of saying this, let alone believe it. All it took was a few good female friends after graduation to teach me that not all women are cruel high school girls.	Every girl I've met who has said this fit into one or both of these categories: * *She* is the actual catalyst of drama with other women * She has a flirtationship with most of the guys she's friends with	1
Minority women, what everyday struggles do you face that white women wouldn't?	After speaking perfectly plain, Colorado-accented English to someone they say, "so, uh, you speak English really well." Well, I'm third generation American, so I sure hope so. Okay, it doesn't happen every day, but a variation of it happens often enough.	Being stared at, CONSTANTLY. I'm not particularly hot or anything, being a Chub-Chub, but I am pretty. People stare. I don't think they would if I was a fat white lady.	1
What's the weirdest "woman-y" thing to happen to you?	These comments are making me feel better about my period. I have fibroid tumors on my uterus and bleed heavily as a result. I have also expelled gigantic clots that flop onto the floor or off the side of the toilet or unknowingly on my leg and I don't know it until I pull my pants back on and feel a sticky wet glob somewhere where it shouldn't be. Also, the natural disasters in my pants when I happen to sneeze, cough, laugh, or just stand up after sitting a while. I'm always impressed with the really, REALLY big clots, though. It's a weird feeling of WTF coupled with pride.	One time I was putting on mascara and I got a sneeze that I wasn't expecting, and poked my eye with the wand, got the mascara all over my brow bone, and felt a clot squish out all at the same time. It was a mess.	0
In what ways do you or your SO break gender norms?	I'm single, but I have an Uncle who was a stay at home dad, and my Aunt was the "breadwinner". But my Uncle went back to work once the kids were more grown up. But I would say thats quite the reversal of "gender norms".	I can't cook for shit, he loves it and will spend ages reading the recipe magazines my mom buys him. When we set up the wedding registry there wasn't anything in particular I was too excited about but even now he gets all excited about the Le Creuset stuff we got.	1
Do you think it is selfish or otherwise wrong to have a child if you suffer(ed) from depression?	Selfish to have a child as a means of alleviating your depression: yes. Same as for people who have a child due to boredom, to keep a relationship going, status symbol, etc. [The... probability of actually achieving said intent is rather irrelevant to whether it is selfish. Many people who have a kid due to these reasons are not particularly successful.] Selfish to have a child because you want one, but just happen to suffer from depression? No.	My father has depression. My grandfather has depression. I have depression. This ends here. I will never in a million years have a kid and pass this on. I would sooner kill myself than have another kid and pass this on. I would sooner destroy the entire world killing everyone on it before I passed this on. My genetic line will end here. I don't know about other people but the most disgusting thing in the world ever is putting someone else in the world that has to deal with this. And I do mean ever.	1
What is something you don't realistically expect your partner to do, but would greatly appreciate if he did that for you?	I'm not in a relationship, but when I am I love and always secretly wish to be surprised by flowers.	It's shallow, but I really like presents. Even something small. I think it's so sweet when you mention something once and a person remembers and gets it for you. I keep a list in my phone to do this for other people, just because I like being the king of presents.	1
Ladies (and gents), do you think its possible to be in a relationship with someone you love, even though the sex is awful or nonexistent?	I see this from time to time: Good sex is 10% of a relationship, bad sex is 90%. Sex is one of the big things that differentiates friendship from a romantic relationship. If it's nonexistent or bad, I would go. But really, I couldn't imagine actually progressing to a serious relationship at all if the sex was bad.	If you are willing to give up sex then I don't think it's impossible. As for "bad sex" I really think there's no such thing as bad sex, just lack of communication! It can be a touchy subject because you don't want to offend the other person or make them feel inadequate or that they don't satisfy you sexually but it's not something that can't be fixed. Personally for me I could not be in a relationship where the sex was bad (and I have been, back when I was younger and embarrassed to bring up the subject!) I don't want to sound like a nympho freak but I love sex too much (with my partner, I am not a crazed slut or anything) I couldn't be in a sexless relationship.	1
When do you feel the most beautiful?	Just before bed when ABSOLUTELY NO ONE IS AROUND TO SEE ME LOOKING SO BEAUTIFUL. *Goddamnit*. Not even kidding here.	When I'm carrying something really, really heavy. Seriously! I asked someone else, and they said "When you're explaining something science-y and you're totally in the zone about it."	1
How do pads stop blood leaking via the butt crack when you're lying on your back?	mine have leaked during sleep due to that. when it's really heavy and i'm scared that I might leak I put a towel down on my bed so I don't accidentally fuck up my sheets.	Poor OP probably thought we were going to reveal some super cool woman secret, but instead we're just like, "nope that's actually a big problem."	1
Ladies, what is your hobby - and how much money do you spend on it?	I have a lot. -fighting (just sport, not like fight club -Embroidery -surfing -skating (skate boarding) -Knitting -Really complicate puzzles. -viscous & totally personally pointless attacks people on House Hunters. How the fuck often do you "entertain"?!? -history ( I live in Boston, there's a LOT) -reading, about a book a week I might be lame. I'm 100% ok with that. :)	Knitting- Don't get to do it as often as I'd like but usually about $50-100 per project. Hiking- Same. Can't afford backpacking/camping supplies so right now it's free. Photography/art- Not supposed to be a hobby but I'll call it that for now since I haven't bothered to make any money...Probably around $20-100 per month. Reading- $100 per year? I don't know, I buy a lot of used books. Gardening- $300 so far this year.	0
(NSFW) Women who have anal sex often, how does anal sex compare to vaginal sex?	They feel very different.. For me to orgasm through anal it has to be very gentle and with clitoral stimulation. However, *some* doods get the impression from porn that they can just dig their dicks right in. NU UH! For me, I prefer a finger in the ass for short periods of time rather than a dick. I only have a small anal plug so I definitely need to get more to work my way up to comfortably being able to take a dick. I've had big and small orgasms through anal. I've had no orgasms and bleeding. And I've also gotten UTI's from anal so... eh...	Lemme guess, this is you cleverly trying to justify why your girlfriend needs to give up her anal cherry. Too bad it seems to have **backfired**	1
What the weirdest, shallowest, or smallest reason you have ever stopped dating someone?	He said "when i meet your mom..." Huge deal breaker to think he would ever meet my standards for him to meet my mom. Dated for over 2 months before he fucked it up.	He had to get naked to do anything in the bathroom. Using the toilet, brushing his teeth, fixing his hair...	0
Ladies, do you have a personal health "secret" that you swear by?	When i find myself getting in a pattern, I always try and do things differently than I have done before. I think it keeps my brain young. Like a fighter pilot or an animal in the jungle, I'm constantly evaluating and exploring my surroundings. TL/DR: I randomly rotate my choice of bathroom stalls at work.	D-Mannose and a fuckton of water at the first sign of a UTI. I also did a regimen of homemade douches (hydrogen peroxide and apple cider vinegar) with probiotic vaginal suppositories to cure my bacterial vaginosis once. (If anyone is interested in knowing more, let me know; I have a detailed blog post which explains this more fully.)	1
Women of reddit: What is one thing about being a man you think you couldn't deal with if you were one?	Sometimes I hear men talk about not feeling sexy or desired by women because the gender roles in our society encourage men to be the active participants who show their desire and women to be the passive objects who desire is acted out upon. As a woman this is also pretty crappy for me and I don't like it, but I think the reverse situation men find themselves in doesn't sound nice either. Sometimes men will post in this sub asking if women even find men attractive, and I think it must be unpleasant to live life wondering that.	Assuming that if I were male my gender identity would also be masculine (if my gender identity remained the same, the biggest problem would be that I no longer get to be cisgendered), I think the biggest irritant would be the pressure that men seem to feel (and some men seem to perpetuate towards other men) to meet a ridiculously narrow definition of "manly". Of course, I can't even begin to speculate how I'd feel about this pressure if my gender identity were male.	1
If ectogenesis (raising a fetus in an artificial womb) was 100% safe, would you use that option instead of natural pregnancy?	I dunno if emotional detachment is a serious concern. Fathers do not get pregnant, but they're often still emotionally attached to their children.	I am child-free, so it wouldn't matter to me, but I think that it would be a wonderful option for women who want children and who may have difficulties conceiving or carrying to term, those who have a fear of or low tolerance for body changes, or for women in appearance-focused careers like actresses/models. I would have no issue with women who chose to use that technology if it was safe and available.	1
What are some things women who are not used to wearing a dress might overlook when wearing one?	I wore a dress to my cousin's wedding last year, and here's what I discovered: * Bending down sucks * Sitting down sucks * Getting up after sitting sucks * Taking long, speedwalking/running strides sucks The solution to all these stupid problems is to keep your legs fucking shut. all of the time. Also you can't bend your torso froward from your waist, depending on how short your dress is. So pretty much just imagine that your waist and upper legs are in an immovable cast and you can't move them. All so no one can see your underwear, yaaaay!	If you have a large bag or anything that rides against your side or back, make sure that your dress isn't riding up with it. So many times. Oh so many times.	0
I'm the only man in an otherwise all women office and I'm constantly left out of lunches and after-work events. What should I do?	I had a similar thing when I started at my most recent job (although opposite as I was the only female with a group of males). I used a two pronged approach of a)inviting myself to things they organised (can be awkward at first but it turned out the main reason I wasn't invited was because they didn't think I'd be interested rather than actively trying to exclude me; and (b)organising things myself and getting them to come along!	Tell them you are feeling excluded and that you won't bite or tell their secrets but you want to be part of the group! Put your hands on your hips while doing so and pout out bottom lip to make it more effective! When all else fails beg and shame them!	1
Did anyone else go see Guardians of the Galaxy? Thoughts?	So wasn't into it. There was a manchild-womaniser-emotionally-arrested-at-7 quality to our hero that I don't find annoying when Chris Pratt is playing Andy Dwyer (minus the womanising) but really don't need more of in heroes.	I absolutely loved it. Seen it twice already and will probably go back a few more times. The soundtrack fits so well. Chris Pratt makes an amazing Starlord. I didn't expect to be that emotional over a tree. It's a roller coaster of emotions - hilarious one second and sob fest the next.	0
Who elses loves Winter?	blech, I hate the cold. I hate having to wear 17 layers of constricting clothes and be barely able to move and waddle around like a penguin. Also, it rains in the winter where I live and I HATE the rain. I have a raincoat, but what do I do about my pants and my shoes? Umbrellas can only do so much. Yeah, no. Nothing good about winter.	Me!! I detest summer. Summer to me means mosquitoes, bug bites, severe sunburn, heatstroke and extra bad BO on public transport. Winter to me means rainy days, storms, cuddling under blankets with the SO for movies and reading a book in front on the fire place. I love snow, but it doesn't snow anywhere near me which sucks! Edit: I also love going to the beach in winter. It's so peaceful.	0
Am I the only one who feels like this sub has a severe childfree bias? Why do you think that is?	* Reddit leans childfree in general * Reddit skews demographically young. Younger people feel less constrained by expected gender roles, but also may feel more strongly about the issue than older people * People who feel they're going against the grain on an issue like that may feel it's notable enough to mention. * Confirmation bias * Parents may have less time for Reddit	I don't like other people's children, but I like my own kids. If I had to decide whether or not I was EVER going to have kids based on dealing with everyone else's kids, I never would have had them. I mean, some other kids are okay, but I don't often find many.	1
I objectify women a lot and I want to stop. How?	I think you just need to have sex.... all other comments are also great advice, But serious op, you need to get this out of the way. Most posts on here seem to want to repress you sexual urges. lol, Good luck with that.	Try making friends with women you find unattractive. In your post, I wonder if you literally don't even **see** those women. Because that's something we notice as well. There are some guys that walk into a room and just go all heat-seeking-missile on the hottest girl- who ironically is probably the MOST annoyed by that behavior, making her and everyone else write him off as a creep. It'll be easier than trying to make friends with women you want to bang. Plus women in general will stop writing you off as a toolbag.	0
Do you sleep talk? Does your partner? If so, what have you said or heard?	Boyfriend talks in his sleep a lot. The best was when I was on my side facing away from him (awake) and all of a sudden he rolls over and starts grabbing my shoulder saying "titty...titty titty" followed by a slight pause when I think he realized that it wasn't a boob. Then in a confused/disappointed voice goes "...titty?". Right back to sleep. *Edit: I fucking misspelled "titty". How dare I.	I do occasionally. I usually just laugh - sometimes for lengthy periods of time - but my fiance says I've said things a handful of times. He says he will talk back to me and sometimes I'll say something again. I've woken myself up laughing a few times which is kind of a weird feeling at first - I usually wake up confused about why I'm sleeping and laughing. My sister was the first one to point out that I laugh in my sleep years ago. I woke up her to asking me what was so funny and why was I laughing so hard.	1
Has your boss ever told you to wear makeup?	Nope and I very rarely wear any to work (only if for a big meeting/interview where I'm dressed up in a suit instead of my usual business casual.) If anyone ever told me to wear makeup, I would be very upset. Unless wearing makeup becomes the norm for both genders and is thus expected of everyone at my place of work, it is unfair to focus on women as needing to take the extra time out of their day to put on makeup to conform to a societal sense of beauty.	I don't know. Work performance isn't the only thing that matters in a professional environment. Dressing and looking professional are also a part of the job. A bare face isn't necessarily unprofessional, but if you put two women next to each other dressed the exact same way, the one wearing makeup would look more professional.	1
What is an interesting fact or helpful hint you have learned on this subreddit?	Lining the water line of my upper lids has been the best thing ever! I get that thick eyelash look with out the harsh line so perfect for work.	Based on the number of men that answer questions directed specifically to women, I think I've learned that lots of men may think they're part of the womenfolk clan.	1
Ladies, what are some of your best "This is why I'm single" moments?	When other girls in my class tell me that guys are afraid to come up to me because of how I look (I wear heels and professional wear, and I do my makeup and hair every morning) and how I carry myself (I try to be eloquent, respectful, and professional at all times because of the career I want). That's when I realize that this is why I'm single. And until someone has the confidence to approach me and hold an intellectual conversation, it's going to stay that way. Not that I'm complaining.	Well, I just sent this text to my friend today, and I think it about sums it up: "God I want to die. I want to die right now. Some hot dude passed me going the opposite way on my run loop. I sped up so we could meet up at the halfway point and he would see how badass I am bc I matched his run time. I ended up getting past the gate and just started barfing, he ran past as I was puking and was like "ARE YOU OKAY?!" All I could muster was a smile and "Damn hills." I want to die. " So. There ya go.	0
What is a small thing your SO does that drives you up the wall?	When we clean together he'll always gravitate towards the non-essential jobs. I'll come down from cleaning the bathrooms to find him organizing DVDs alphabetically. Really? Generally I ignore it but if his parents are coming to town (mother is super-clean nazi and will start cleaning my home if she thinks it isn't clean enough), I can get pretty upset.	ITT: Lots and lots of things I'd bring up with my SO in a calm manner because we like not doing things that annoy the other person.	1
What are some quotes or proverbs that people keep repeating thinking they sound clever or deep, but you just think they're stupid?	Anything that is anchor themed that says "I refuse to sink". I get so irrationally irritated when I see this. Anchors fucking sink. That's just what they do. You anchor themed pillow makes no sense. -___-	"If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best!" -Marilyn Monroe, the unhappy, lonely drug addict who killed herself.	1
What is a BIG thing your SO does that may be hurting your relationship?	No sex. I'm lucky if we get it maybe once a month. It's an issue that I continually bring up that just gets brushed aside	He moved to the US to do his masters. That... bastard! But he cried and said he loved me the day he left. Its been five days. I miss him so much	1
If you wanted to get a boob job, and your SO didn't like it, would you want to hear his opinion?	While it is my body and I will do what I want with it, if we are in a relationship I want to know his opinion. My boyfriend asks my opinion before a new haircut. I think that is a bit much but he says that since he is changing his appearance from how he was when he met he values my opinion. I guess my point is you should take his opinion into consideration, it is your body and you should do what you want. If you choose to do something dramatic and he loses his attraction or something... well that sucks but you should know before doing anything.	I'd think that he's entitled to his opinion and to state it once, but he'd need to realize that his opinion doesn't carry a lot of weight. Other things come first and he'd need to respect that.	1
How do you feel about "adult only" places or events, like condos, wedding, etc.?	I've gotten two wedding invitations recently that noted "adult reception." I don't have children, and I've never been married, so I'm speaking as a single, childless person. I think it's weird. When people get married, don't they want to celebrate with their family? Don't families have kids? I don't understand why people would want to exclude children from the festivities, and additionally, put that much more pressure on guests to find someone to watch their children. If I were to ever get married, I would probably hire some people to help out at the ceremony as "baby sitters." That way, children can come but parents can let lose as well. Maybe it wouldn't work, just an idea.	I went on holiday to an adult only resort in Cancun and it was absolute bliss. This may be partly because I'm a teacher so it was nice to get a proper break from children.	0
What are your awesome lady-oriented life hacks that you feel everyone else should know about?	Nooo! Don't put bras on backwards! ): It kills the life of the bra. It stretches it out so much faster.	For the bra, to ensure your breasts are filling the cup properly, you should bend over after putting it on, and gently adjust how they're seated. They should fill the cups completely without being pressed down against your ribs, or spilling over the sides or top. If any of that is happening, you have the wrong size bra.	0
Have you ever been to a party where it became apparent that you were only invited as a sex prospect?	Nah, I'm fun so people invite me because I'm fun.. AND a lady. But I've never felt like I was invited solely for my gender, I get along with everyone and talk people up, there's always been a few mutual friends at any party I go to.	Senior year of high school my friends and I were invited to a party by one of the guys we knew from our local mall. We showed up and it was immediately obvious that the only females in attendance were the two that came with us. It didn't help matters that they were watching anime porn on the living room tv. We left pretty quick.	0
who is the dumbest person you've ever dated?	My roommate dated a girl who came to the apartment one time to watch a movie. She was perusing my DVD collection for something to watch. And after about four minutes of silent looking, she says, "Oh, they're in alphabetical order." It took a lot to stifle a condescending comment.	I dated a guy who told me tapioca and rice were the same thing (like tapioca pudding was just another name for rice pudding). I don't think it's a big deal making a mistake like that, people make silly mistakes, but when I told him that wasn't accurate, he got really mad at me and kept insisting and saying that he knew more about food than I did (he wanted to be a chef). So later I looked it up and he got really, really mad and said, "You always have to be right, don't you?!" No. I just ... was right.	0
Those of you who are divorced, when did you know that the marriage was over?	It's quite long winded and I can't be bothered to cover all the drama, so long story short, we fought over a jar of peanut butter, I threw a shoe at his legs but apparently it caught his kidney and really hurt, next thing I know he had me pinned to the bed and spat in my face. Repeatedly. I had to headbutt him violently to get him off me as he was a lot stronger. Haha, that's the first time I've realised my marriage essentially ended over a jar of peanut butter. Yes I still eat it, now I'll eat it with glee remembering that.	I've told this story a few times. In short, it was the mother of all drunken outbursts, ending with him coming at me with a knife. After a murder attempt, however halfhearted, I don't do take backsies. I let him get across the country before I let him know I wasn't coming. I can reflect on it now and just see how ridiculous things are, but it was terrifying then. As soon as any abuse starts, get out. I waited too long and I almost lost my life, I know others aren't as fortunate.	0
Happily married women of reddit, what is the most difficult time you and your spouse have worked through?	I've been married for 6 years. The first year was the hardest. We were 20. And we both had a lot of issues dealing with immaturity and I found my husband had a porn addiction. We worked through it though and he got help with his porn issue and we both just started to grow up and work on our marriage. Things are soooo much better now. And God is a big reason for that as well. I'm very happy with my life and don't regret getting married young at all. It was hard at first, but in the long run worth it.	Been together for 14 married for 11. Our biggest disagreement was how many kids to have when we had been married for five years. We had two already and I really wanted another two and he was happy with what we already had. We spent months going back and forward over the pros and cons. After many discussions he decided that one more would be a good idea and I to let go of the notion of having four kids. A compromise if you will. At the first ultra sound of my third pregnancy we found out we were having twins.	0
When Vasalgel becomes available for all consumers, will you prefer to use it or to continue using female-oriented birth control?	I'd use both. Two forms of control is better than just one. Plus, I'm on birth control for medical reasons too.	Sorry, but no fucking way am I injecting anything in my cock. My gf can use whatever BC she wants, that's fine with me. But I refuse to let a needle anywhere near my member.	1
Does anyone here NOT have body issues?	I like the body I have a lot. I could stand to exercise more and tone up though. It does help that my husband says he loves my body everytime I say something that I don't like. I learned pretty early that my body is nice, enjoy it while I'm young haha. I think the biggest change in my attitude came when I went through a bad breakup and lost almost 10 lbs on a body that was already under 100. Being so skinny was very scary. I don't recommend it. I like the way I look, but not the way my body works. Autoimmune sucks.	It's weird, when I look at individual parts, I can't say I really like any part. But looking at myself as a whole, I think I'm not bad.	0
[serious] any ladies in their twenties out there confused about their goals in life?	I have a very high libido, but I also don't want to get married until later in my twenties. My culture and religion make it impossible for me to just go down that road and do one-night-stand. So now my bigger confusion in life are - Do I need to focus on my career or My need? I want to be independent and strong but I don't want to be associated with anyone personally. I'm still trying to fit into the hectic lifestyle and growing career and still can't date without thinking of marriage.	Oh, absolutely. I have no idea what to do with myself. Do I want to go to college? What kind of job, or career, do I even want? Do I want kids someday? What if I never find 'the one' or get married? My conclusion: Yay, cats!	0
What are the top ten things you look for in a man?	My boyfriend is my ideal man. Tall Skinny Smart Red hair Ambitious Hardworking My family likes him Likes/wants kids Similar interests Kind	1.

Ladies of color, what's been harder to deal with throughout your life: racism or sexism?	Both equally, but I actually found that when I was heavier THAT was actually way worse, if that makes a difference at all. I've had my fair share of anti-Hispanic racism and sexism for being a woman, but nothing ever really compared to what I got for being overweight when I was overweight.	Sexism because I'm female in a male dominated career I suppose and I don't look tough even though I am. I'm white though so I suppose that's why I haven't ever really experienced racism and as I am an atheist being 'technically jewish' never really comes up, and when it does there has been some insults. However neither has ever gotten to me, racism and sexism is a part of life for me and I just laugh it off (or punch the person and then laugh it off) Why take it seriously?	1
Is there a right to be annoyed if a partners attention is on their phone when you two are alone?	Weird, when I only have 10 min left of getting ready and leaving, I just kind of hope he stays out of my way. So him sitting down w/ his phone seems ideal.	For me it's not just partners but people in general, Nothing pisses me off more when I'm talking to someone and they start playing on their phone.	0
Have you ever been with a guy who either slipped the condom off or finished inside after saying he would pull out?	That's rape and no thankfully I've never been in that situation my friend did though she took him to court	Yep. It broke during, but he just threw it to the side and finished anyway. Then he told me something like, "I guess you need to go take care of that". I was 19 and he was the second guy I ever slept with. I tried calling the hospital to find out what I had to do, but they got really catty with me about looking for EC and said "we don't offer that kind of thing to people". I ended up driving all the way to a Planned Parenthood in St. Louis (he did not help with anything) lying about where I was going. Of course, there were protesters there, and I had to walk past a group of about 30 people holding signs and yelling at me about fetuses and such, all alone and scared to death. It was the worst.	0
Do any other sex-positive women still become uncomfortable with excessive nudity in TV and film?	I definitely wouldn't even identify as "sex positive" as I understand the term in this sub - most nudity on TV, IMO, is completely useless, in that it doesn't actively contribute to the plot. If it does, I'm fine with it, but if it's just there for no reason, I find it distasteful and immodest. edit: downvoting for contributing to discussion in a non-offensive way. Stay open to discourse, AW	I'm uncomfortable with it when it's obviously being done in an exploitative way, like I believe there's such a thing as tasteful and realistic nudity, but if it seems like the nudity is thrown in just to be sexually exploitative or edgy or provocative, or if it's extremely one sided, I have a problem with it.	0
What do you think about letting your child wear a bikini? How do you explain your rule to her?	My daughters have always had to wear two piece bathing suits (they're 18 now) because they're very tall, and have long backs. They definitely weren't the only girls in their peer group growing up who wore two piece bathing suits. As other people have said, creeps will find anything to creep about. For every person who might have in appropriate thoughts about a child in a bikini, there's another one who would find more modest swimwear a turn-on. 8 is a great time to start having these types of conversations with her, if you're not doing it already. You don't have to get into the nuts and bolts of sexuality and clothes, but you can start talking about choices, and fashion, and peer groups etc.	I just wanted to point out that high schools are banning yoga pants for this exact reason, in the U.S. Creepers can't be held responsible for the temptation of assaulting young girls? So it's the victim's fault for their own assault/rape basically. Maybe these misguided and troubled individuals need to have some accountability and consequence. Yes, I'm going to echo the others and say a bikini swimsuit is perfectly fine on a little girl.	1
**HOLY SHIT MOMENT** THIS is what it's supposed to be like. Have you had your HOLY SHIT moment &amp; what was it like for you?	My holy shit moment was at an intervention for my ex-husband. I was talking about the life we could have, and at every turn he had a counter argument about why it wasn't possible, why it was silly or unimportant. Finally, he gave his shut down statement: "Our life isn't that bad how it is. Things are ok." Then he told me he wouldn't be going to rehab. HOLY SHIT. Daily black out drinking, verbal/physical/psychological abuse, infidelity, never talking or spending time together... "isn't that bad"? I told him that I loved him, but that for me, it was "that bad." Then I walked out and never looked back.	Idk, I guess I haven't really had one of those, and I don't know if I believe everybody has "one".	1
What is the biggest obstacle you and you SO have faced in your relationship?	Our mental illnesses. Adhd H, Bpd, depression and anxiety - Me Adhd C, depression and anxiety - My husband, Adhd H, Depression, anxiety, possible bipolar - My boyfriend. (we are poly) yeah, we are a fun mixed bag, add one toddler.	He was unemployed, which led to depression and strong feelings of inadequacy. This lasted about a year. I tried to be supportive both financially and emotionally but it was very difficult.	0
Bisexual ladies – does it bug you when a male partner sees bisexuality as a turn on?	If it was an obsession that would bother me. If they found it hot I wouldn't be especially bothered.... I find it hot if my partner is bi, so...	If you found a bi guy hot would you not saying that to him because it might invalidate their social identity?	1
How did you last upset a lot of people on Reddit?	I said it was kinda weird for a 16 year old girl to want to sit on her dad's lap all the time. Not sexual weird. Just kinda weird. I've never seen so many angry replies in my life.	I said that I might marry a safe option who I wasn't deeply in love with because I don't want to be poor when I'm old.	1
If your local foodery named a special after you, what would the dish be, and what would it be called?	Mine would be called thunderjugs and it would be two chicken breasts stuffed with cheese, spinach, and bacon then battered, deep fried, and smothered in special sauce.	The Bleeding Asshole: Two large and fresh, steamed turds. Delicately wrapped in fried bologna and prosciutto. Featuring a light and fragrant crushed tomato sauce drizzled generously.	1
Ladies of reddit who read erotica, what ruins a good story for you?	The description of the people's bodies. "I'm a good looking man in my 40's, some would say I'm quite handsome. I'm fit, work out with a 6 pack" Then the girl "She was perfect. Long red hair down to her breasts. Her gratuitous bosoms hung softly yet perky at a large 36 DD. She was petite size I could fit my hands around her waist. Her bottom was so juicy and sat perfectly in her tiny skirt that she wore everywhere, with no underwear. " Like, they have no idea how size works. I get so irritated.	Although the moral behind it is nice, condoms in written erotica aren't sexy. "Heavily breathing he gently ran his fingers down my back and said 'okay imma grab a condam now' I was so turned on"	1
Does anyone here feel like they have a higher sex drive than their partner? How do you feel about it/how do you deal with it?	One thing that no one is addressing that I'd like to is that an erection doesn't automatically equal wanting to have sex. That kind of attitude is the same one that leads people to believe men can't be raped by women and it's just really toxic in general. Boners can happen at inconvenient times, they can happen without a lot of horniness (or not happen when there is a lot of horniness), etc. Just try to ditch the whole attitude of boner = sex because it's not helpful to anyone and can even be harmful.	Not a female but a guy, he probably jerks off too much . Seriously if you do, you most likely won't a)want much sex b) be able to get a hard on to have sex.	1
Women who were forced to carry a pregnancy to term after being denied an abortion (any trimester), what were your experinces and what is your current relationship with your child?	I was the child and my mother and I never had a close or healthy relationship. Lacked affection and much of a bond. Sucks.	Man, all of these stories are nice and all but I strongly detest children, the idea of me personally parenting and am tokiphobic as hell. If I was denied an abortion (which hopefully I won't be, I have a normal period, money saved up, and am a normal weight) I honestly think the shock would lead me to suicide. Even with adoption I don't think I could handle 9 months of pregnancy.	1
What do you consider to be the difference between being sexually desired and being objectified?	Objectification is: thinking about a woman solely as an *object* for your pleasure. She doesn't exist outside of the purpose of entertaining or pleasing you. Objectification is not: thinking women are attractive So, when you dismiss the thoughts, wills, desires, plans, ideas, and values of a woman and simply view her as an object that you can use for your pleasure, you are objectifying her. If you find her physically appealing, and want to get to know her as a person, you are not objectifying her.	As a man this really confuses me? What am I meant to do I don't want to objectify women but I'm always attracted to women. Most of who I've never met and probably never will and a lot of the time I don’t even really want too. Dose this mean I'm objectifying them? It objectification = attraction? Are women never attracted to men only for looks? I mean magic mike's a thing?	1
Have you ever slept with a man who you knew was taken?	No, and I would never. Knowingly helping someone cheat is despicable, and they're as much to blame as the cheater themselves.	I have. It was a drunken hookup, and he was in an LDR with no end date. Neither of those things makes it okay, but those were the reasons I used to rationalize it at the time. I feel bad, but they're still together, so I guess they worked it out. On a broader level, I believe that both parties should claim responsibility for their actions, but the person with the SO has broken the trust in their relationship, whereas the other man/woman doesn't have that kind of obligation beyond the implications for their own moral compass.	0
Women of reddit who hover over public toilets: why don't you lift the seat?	If I was gonna take the time to do that I might as well just take the time to put the stupid little paper thing on the seat. I just want to get in and out with touching as few things as possible. And for the last time, no, I don't get piss all over the seat. Don't fucking tell me "Yes you do, you just don't realize it!" because that's stupid. You are not there in the stall refereeing my piss. I have eyes. I can see the seat when I'm done. There is nothing there. I get more pee on my own toilet seat at home from sitting down on it (the pee drips off when I stand/lean up to wipe).	It's so irritating that people hover because they think something about the toilet seat is gross, but then proceed to pee all over it. YOU ARE THE REASON YOU HOVER	0
What fashion trend can you just not get on board with?	NORMCORE. Ugh. I'm tired of seeing expensive dressy sweatshirts every where in stores right now. We've gone from "Homeless or Hipster?" to "Bankrolled or Baglady?". :P	LACE. It was gorgeous when Prada did it, beautiful when the Victorians made it work...But since lace has become popular in mass fashion, it just looks cheap and flimsy and tacky.	1
What are your 5 non-negotiables when it comes to finding "the one"?	* Have passions in life. * Be patient and no short fuse. * Be open minded to new ideas and new things * Be a good human being, not just be good to me but to oneself and others. * Be able to communicate with me well.	* Be patient * Be very liberal * Not be money driven (ideally lower-middle to middle class social standing, too) * Be laid back but still passionate about something * Want children	1
As an adult, are you in the same socioeconomic class you were raised? Higher? Lower?	My parents still give me money. They're upper middle class. Definitely an advantage. My friend teaches preschool (Headstart) in an inner city, those kids are so fucked. They're only 3 years old and when they play house they pretend that their partners are in jail. It's really depressing.	I was raised in an upper-middle class home with oodles of privilege in an impoverished rural community. I am now a bourgeois hipster living in a hip neighborhood in the city. I don't have the kind of income my folks had, but my lifestyle sure kicks ass.	1
Ladies, what are your short girl problems?	I'm 5'4 (163cm). I don't think of myself as a very short woman, but hugging and kissing my 6'4 SO sometimes hurts my neck (and of course, I often stand on tiptoes). He has a mirror in his bathroom that is too high and I can only see my eyes. Also, sometimes I can't reach products at a grocery store. And finding the perfect pair of jeans/pants is almost impossible. Edit: I work as a physiotherapist and when I have tall men as patients, I feel really weird standing next to them or behind them, because I'm so small compared to them and I get the feeling that they won't take me seriously.	5'3 here. Going to shows and concerts is definitely the worst. Without fail, there's always that dude that pushes his way in front of me, blocking out that window of space between other people's heads that I so carefully positioned myself in to see. I hate that guy.	0
OK lofty ladies, it's our turn. What height-related problems do your shorter friends never understand?	PANTS. Please don't complain to me about not being able to find pants when you're short. Every department store has a petite section. You can hem pants. You can't make them longer. I have maybe one pair of pants that actually fits properly. I wear skirts most of the time, and ankle pants in the summer or covered with boots in the winter.	I'm just going to go on record and say I love tall girls. #1 most attractive feature to me. So all you tall ladies keep being you; you're beautiful.	1
What is one shocking thing you've learned about your SO since you've been with them?	One day I came home and heard what sounded like silverware clinking in the bathroom. I opened the door, only to find him eating a bowl of cereal while on the toilet pooping. He expressed no shame and simply told me he does it regularly because it's "efficient."	He sometimes likes to paint his toenails (but makes sure no body except for me sees it). It's not about being transsexual or anything, it's just.. maybe the idea that nobody knows it? Having a secret? Also, he is also always worrying about his hair not being modeled he way he likes it. Ok, these two things combined do make him sound a bit gay, but he really isn't! He just cares about his hair, haha!	1
What behavior do you engage in that might be perceived as a red flag? What's your explanation for it?	My general mode of socializing reads as flirtatious to many people. So if you don't know me well or aren't used to people like me, it looks like I'm flirting with everyone. I'm really religious, but also a liberal artist type. This means I tend to be a problem for people on the more extreme ends of both religious and artsy/intellectual communities. Luckily I found people who occupied a similar middle ground to date and eventually marry.	I tend to get needy too fast. I like texting and talking on the phone when I can with someone I like. I have a huge fear of being forgotten, but I also really want to spend as much time as I can with that person cause I want to make them my whole world. (yes I know that's not healthy either, but I live a lifestyle where it's normal)	0
Do you hate wearing pants?	I love pants. I hate *buying* pants but I love wearing them. I hate wearing skirts. I feel like I am not wearing enough clothing and like I'm playing dress-up. Also I can't sit right in them.	I HATE PANTS! They rarely fit right, too tight somewhere, too loose somewhere, make me look weird at my midsection. Dresses all the way (though I do wear pants under my dresses in the winter).	1
What's something you wish you were taught when you were younger that is predominately taught to men?	Car stuff. Although my brother is 17 and hasn't been taught either, except to just take it in if something is wrong. However, I guess I do not mind so much though	I come from a big family, including 4 older brothers. All of my older brothers were in Boy Scouts, and starting at a very young age, they were doing cool stuff. They would camp out in tents, build fires, go on hikes, fish, and practice archery. As a young girl, I thought this was AWESOME, and asked if I could join Girl Scouts. In the 8 years that I was a scout, we only camped in heated cabins. We made s'mores in the fireplace and made friendship bracelets. I never once held a fishing rod or wielded a bow. We weren't allowed to make fires. But hey, at least I could assemble those pre-packaged foam "crafts" and I knew my way around glitter.	0
Ladies of askwomen, how much of your body do you shave (or use another method of hair removal on)?	I shave: * legs * under my arms * toes * knuckles * some of my pubic hair And then I pluck my eyebrows. I do all of these things almost every day because I find hair itchy and uncomfortable. I don't have particularly thick or dark hair.	I shave my legs, from just above my knees to my feet, my armpits, and my groin/genital area (not all of it, but quite a lot). I also pluck any hairs that grow on the tops of my feet and my big toes, along with the random long hair that grows out of the "beauty mark" on my face or the random long hair from around my belly button. I shave solely for my own comfort only. All the hair I shave and/or pluck I do because it is hair that otherwise annoys the frack out of me.	1
Mothers of reddit: During pregnancy, did the size of your baby correlate with your overall body size?	I'm 5'8 and weighed 240 when I got pregnant. I weighed 280 when I gave birth. My son weighed exactly 6lbs. My good friend is about 5'4 and maybe 140lbs. I have no idea how much weight she gained during pregnancy but her son weighed over 9lbs. She gave birth to him vaginally. In a bathtub. At her house. With no pain meds. I give her mad props.	No. Baby size correlates most strongly with poorly managed gestational diabetes. The higher the blood sugar of the mum, the larger the baby. Ease of delivery has more to do with the mum's pelvis than overall height and weight of the mother. My mother had an easy time of it and I did as well with a completely intervention-free birth. I am a large person, being 176 cm tall, my husband is 188 and our two children were both >95th percentile for length and about the 75th for weight, IIRC. My daughter was 7 pounds 11 oz, my son was 8 lbs 11 oz.	1
Do you feel comfortable giving ''instructions'' to a guy when he performs oral sex to you?	Like, the very first time? No, I usually just feel him out to see how he does it. After that, assuming he didn't get me off the first time? Absolutely.	Yes, it's important to me, and yes, I communicate with my partner when I have sex because I'm an adult and that's what adults do.	1
DAE have a love affair with 3/4 length sleeves?	I need to wear more things with 3/4 sleeves. I'm always wearing long sleeve sweaters and inevitably end up with the sleeves pushed up my arms. I don't know how it happens, but apparently, my arms hate sleeves even when I'm freezing.	I'm 6' with a 6'3" wingspan. They're not my favorite, but I forced a liking for them because they look intentional and long sleeves NEVER are long enough, like ever.	0
Ladies, did you fall in love with someone you weren't expecting?	Yeah. Met some guy from reddit for a hobby. Married him last month. Redditors: no creepier than regular people you'd meet IRL	Yeah, my bestfriend/FWB. We were/are great friends. But in relationship terms I (and he) did not think we were suited. We've been together 5 years now, and definitely.	1
What items do you own that are better suited to a different life?	Sometimes it seems like all my really feminine clothing should belong to someone else. Other times my baggy jeans and t-shirts feel the same way. I think I'm having some gender issues right now... :(	I have this very unflattering but super comfy tunic length sweater. It has a kangaroo pouch and makes me look pregnant, but it's kind of casual and adorable in a weird way. I bought it because it would be the perfect thing to wear while cuddling with my boyfriend on the couch and watching TV. You know, if I had a boyfriend. Or a couch. Or a TV.	0
Do you feel like guys, in general, fail to account for average to unattractive women when generalising?	Yes. "Women get free drinks, chivalry, and sex!" Oh honey. Conventionally attractive women get that shit. Your average Justine does not.	To a degree, but I also think there aren't as many unattractive women as there are unattractive men, so I do think they're right at least that women in general have it easier than men in general. I'm not really sure how much easier, though. Obviously there are more variables than attractiveness and even an attractive girl could have trouble if she's just not particularly confident or willing to put herself out there.	1
What traits make a guy marriage material?	1) Has a solid support system consisting of both family and friends. 2) Has a good job. 3) Is seeking a strong woman with a career of her own. 4) Wants to build an empire of wealth **with me** not **for me**. That whole "I will show you the world" bullshit is really condescending. 5) Wants kids. 6) Likes weird stuff, and likes trying weird stuff. 7) Isn't a cookie-cutter personality. 8) Takes care of himself physically and mentally. 9) Is willing to subvert gender roles. 10) Open-minded. 11) Goofy.	Funny, sweet, nice to children and others, wants to do better for himself, wants a family, trustworthy, similar goals/aspirations, and loving each other is pretty important.	0
If you found out that your 12-year-old son was sexually harassing women online, what would you do?	I agree with taking away Internet. I would also make him write a 20 page report on rape culture and misogyny. Without the internet. He would have to do some good old library research. He would also have to start volunteering at women's shelters. I hope though, like drugs or sex, this is something I would already have spent some time educating both all of my children about.	No internet, no games. He'd have to read his comments out loud in front of his father and I, and we'd have a long discussion about why he wrote those things and why it was wrong to do so.	0
What's the longest you've gone without showering?	About a week. Army. Sometimes because of an FTX. Sometimes because water is limited in Iraq. But I only went without showering because it wasn't possible. I still kept myself clean with baby wipes as best I could. Purposely going more than two days is just nasty and I'd never do it out of laziness. I'm no slob.	Three months. In the middle of summer. In Arizona. While only using maxi pads. I did go swimming often, but to say that I was a disgusting teenager would be the understatement of the year. I blame falling for the cult that is "juggalo family."	0
Caught my nipple while vigorously combing my hair last night. What dumb way have you hurt yourself recently?	I have huge boobs, and after scrolling through reddit naked with my laptop on my ribs, I slammed my screen on my nipple. My s.o. saw me do it. I will never live it down.	Just last week I was exercising with my Wii console. Well my shoe got catch on the carpet and I twisted my ankle, pulled my knee, and pulled the muscle that is between my thigh and pelvis. It was made worse by the wii person going "Don't give up now!" while I was crying on the floor.	0
Have you ever been shocked by how attractive someone is?	Yeah the girl I'm currently dating is ridiculously attractive. I'm surprised that someone like her would want to date someone like me. She's a honest 10/10 while I'm a 5/10 balding, slightly chubby guy. When she sleeps over my house, she often falls asleep with her head on my chest and I can't stop thinking just how beautiful and angelic she is. On top of how great she looks, she's an amazing person. I can't believe how lucky I am. However, the end of this winter will probably be the last time I see her because I'm going to be moving away for work in the summer when I graduate and she goes back to school far away for the spring semester.	I was working at the GAP and we had to say this line over-and-over again. "Hi! Welcome to the GAP. Have you heard about our 40% off sale on blahblah?" One time I was folding sweaters or something and this guy walks past me. I looked up and was so shocked by how HOT he was, I ended up saying something like "Hi!... There's a sale... 40% off. Welcome!" and slinking away.	0
Ladies who live with your SO, do any of you have a vastly different diet from your SO? How do you manage meals?	Yeah actually, almost the same issue. My husband decided to stop eating carbs when I was a vegetarian, and he can be picky about vegetables. We both compromise. I started eating meat (for a variety of reasons) as long as it's ethically sourced -- it costs a million dollars but it's worth it to me. I keep pasta/rice/bread meals to a minimum but sometimes that's what I'm making and if he wants something different he's on his own. I also hide vegetables in his food. For instance, when I make lentil soup, I put in tons of veggies and then take an immersion blender to it so you can't tell what's in there. When I make chili, I put a big pile of veggies through the food processor before dumping them in the pot. As long as he doesn't know about them, he loves them.	I'm mostly vegan and my SO is only vegetarian on Tuesdays (yes that sounds weird, but it's one day a week for his mom). Luckily for us, his mom sends him home on Sundays with 2 dinners and a lunch - Usually chicken. We don't buy meat when we go grocery shopping, mostly because of the cost. On days he does not have dinner, we usually have some combination of tofu/vegetables/pasta/potatoes. He likes what I make so it works out. We usually have pizza once a week and quesadillas once a week for which I use fake cheese and he uses real cheese. And sometimes on weekends we'll go out for burgers or (real) pizza and that's when I'll eat meat, cheese, and whatever.	1
Have you ever been worried that you were someone's "safe option" or second choice?	Of course. I am painfully average - not very pretty, intelligent or talented. Guys never went crazy over me or anything. I am aware that I will never be someone's first choice. I am okay with that.	No. Partly because I don't really buy the idea of the safe option - they always seem to describe themselves as the safe option when the female partner doesn't want to have threesome's etc like she did with people she didn't care about, rather than seeing their relationship as more than what she had previously. Caring about being happy in the relationship doesn't make you the safe option. But, partly because I don't see how I'd be the safe option. I'm more likely to wonder why they are putting up with my shit.	1
Has having a son impacted the way you look at and view men?	You'll probably have more luck in places like /r/mommit because a lot of people here don't have kids. But I don't think it's changed at all (but then again not my bio son)	Definitely. Growing up I was taught men are strong and no crying- leaving me to believe they didn't feel like girls do. My son is the sweetest most loving and caring boy I know. But it wasn't until then, that I viewed all guys as sweet little boys who've had to repress their emotions to be men. They just have tough exteriors but deep down inside is just a human who wants to be loved too :)	0
What's the worst/funniest/craziest thing you you've witnessed or have been involved with at your company Holiday party?	I live tweeted last years Holiday party. The company had hired an Elvis-impersonator magician, and my boss got incredibly upset because he kept doing magic tricks instead of getting right to the singing portion. It almost ended in fisticuffs. I no longer work for that company.	I used to work in a restaurant kitchen with all men. I'm not bad looking, when I try. I'm 5'7", skinny, with bright blue eyes, and long blond hair. However, whenever I went to work, I didn't put any effort into my appearance, didn't see the point. Hair thrown up, tied with a bandana, food stained uniform, not a drop of makeup. The holiday party came around. I got dressed up, did my hair and put on my usual face full of makeup. I actually had coworkers do a double take when they saw me. "I had no idea who you were at first". "Oh my god when you walked in the door, I wondered if you were the new waitress or something". "It just took me a good 10 minutes to realize that was you". That was a hilarious evening.	1
Any other verbally needy ladies out there?	I actually get annoyed if a gf is fishing for compliments. It sounds like the only reason you pretty yourself up is that you give your boyfriend reason to massage your ego. >The most I ever get is 'pretty', and frankly it's just left me feeling like crap and like he doesn't think I'm sexy or beautiful. Just...pretty. I actually have to roll my eyes here. I mean a compliment is apparently not even enough. You have apparently something specific in mind and want to hear precisely that and "pretty" just doesn't cut it. Yes, it's nice when the SO says something affectionate, but as soon as you expect it it looses all merit and would really put me off to say something, because I know now I HAVE to say something nice. Compliments should be offered not requested. That's not how compliments work.	Yes. I'm not someone who needs a lot of validation from other people but it's very important I get it from my SO. He's horrible at it though.	0
I'm sick of all the anti-child bias here. What DO you like about kids?	That they won't be children forever. Oh, and I like that there are people, saints really, who actually like those little shits so that I don't have to deal with them.	I am child-free, but I generally like kids. I like talking to them and hearing the crazy or wondrous things they have to say. I like that they always wanna play and I have someone who's totally down to play hide n seek, tag, or board games (and I'm almost 30). I like giving advice to teenagers too, because i went through some shit and feel I can relate. I like smiling babies that just beam positivity. I like the hope I see in the good kids who are gonna be something later in life. I have my own reasons for not wanting any of my own, but I certainly will help be a positive experience for the little ones I come across.	0
What is something about yourself that people often don't believe or ignore when you tell them? How do you deal with this?	A lot of people do not believe I'm 6 feet tall. At least until I stand up and they're right next to me then I get, "Oh yeah, I guess you're right." I do know my own height, but thanks. This one guy who was shorter than me (5'8"? 5'9"?) kept saying he was taller than me, AS I was making eye contact with his forehead.	that i almost died from my eating disorder a few years ago, or generally that i have one at all~ because i am fat. or you know, the usual things. i am fat and therefore i must sit around stuffing my face full of sugar and junk food all day. hah.	1
What embarrassing things have you done in front of your SO's parents?	Not his parents, but I was with my boyfriend's aunt and uncle adult cousins and I accidentally cut my hand and bled all over their white pomerianian. It was fairly mortiftying.	Closest would be me telling their son to work out more to be as fit as his dad. The mother got a little child defensive. It was an ex.	1
Women who hit rock bottom in their 20's, that are now successful, what made you change?	My early twenties was like "I don't wanna be an adult I wanna be 14 I don't want no job." It was horrible, everyone thought I was crazy for not learning how to drive, family was not supportive. They thought I was a lazy bastard. Ok, I kind of was. But after my dad died I dropped out of college. After that I was lost. I then started beauty school and got a job, bought my own fucking car with my own fucking money. I'm not a lazy bastard no more everyone who was not supportive can kiss my ass.	The thing that turned my ass around was realizing the problem was not just that I was picking the wrong guys, but also that I was the type of girl that heroin addicted grocery store workers wanted to date. And that wasn't who I wanted to be. I wanted to be successful, happy, fit, and to have hobbies besides drinking and yelling at my boyfriends for drugs. So I refused to date the lowest common denominator. I started eating healthy. I started exercising. These things pulled me out of my depression. I finished school because I could finally do it. My depression has come back and my healthy eating fluctuates, but for the most part, I'm way better off. I have a decent job and a good car and an awesome SO. I have learned to cook (rather well, I might add), I've learned so much about my body.	0
Ladies, what is your most oh my god I want to hide under a rock embarrassing story?	I had a psychotic breakdown. During this breakdown, I was "in love" with some dude I was close to. I sent this dude nudes, erotic videos and audios, and I sent a cute little painting to his house. I was literally batshit at the time. You know that "behavior change" side effect with medications? Wheeeee that's what happened with me. A year later, I'm pretty recovered and back to normal. I wish that I could erase that period of my life, but I have to live with it. Forever.	I got drunk on Halloween with some friends, who wanted to go into town to a club. I had drank the same amount as usual, but the subway into town... That swaying pushed me overboard and I threw up when we got off. Then I *apparently* laid on the floor of the subway station until I felt better. (I definitely don't remember that) Anyways we came back to my apartment and they made sure I didn't die. It was hugely embarrassing and I ruined Halloween ):	1
Do you ever worry that a sex tape or nude photos will come back to haunt you?	If you worry about that, then a LPT is not make nude photos. There isn't even a point to taking them.	Yes. I just found out my ex sent pictures of me to at least one of our mutual friends. It's degrading and embarrassing. I never wanted the friend to see me like that. My ex won't even apologize :(	0
Has a break in the relationship ever helped anyone?	My husband and I took a break for 7 months. It was helpful in some ways and damaging in others... in the end we both missed our life together and decided to be back together and we are still together. I can say, I wish I would have never taken the break... there were things that we both did while apart that was damaging to our relationship now. But on the other hand... what if we didn't take a break? Maybe we would have never started to appreciate eachother again...	A break just means "I want to try out someone else, but still have the option to come back to you if it doesn't work out" P.S. This is a male, personal perspective by the way.	1
How have you fucked up 2015 this far?	I kissed a girl at the new years party and didn't get her number ;_; Then i remembered unless she's bisexual it wouldnt work in a couple months anyway blah	I thought I could sleep with only a pad last night because I hadn't started really bleeding yet- it was mostly just a muddy color when I went to the bathroom and wiped. Except I have the flu and am having bad coughing fits. This morning I woke up and coughed before even moving or getting up, and SPLOOSH. There goes that pair of panties. :|	0
I dream of starting a cat-friendly bar, like a boozier version of a cat cafe. What are your silly business ideas?	I think all offices should have cats. My cat, specifically, so everyone can feel my daily pain of trying to type with a cat laying on their arm and licking their hands. But, also, cats are just so relaxing and hilarious at the same time. Too bad about people with allergies, though :(	A clothing store for people who are confused like me, where kind, soft-spoken salespeople take you aside and gently but firmly inform you which pieces look good on you and why, and send you home with a complete trendy but flattering and photogenic wardrobe. "Goodbye!" they call as you go out the door. "See you next year!" You leave content that you will not have to think about how to look cute for the next twelve months, when you do it all over again.	0
Any women feel like you're almost exclusively attracted to people more conventionally attractive than yourself? If so, how do you cope?	Yep. I've always been more attracted to average, fit, or slim guys. And I've always been overweight. Hell, that's one of the reasons I've been working on losing weight. I can't expect a fit guy to want an unfit chick. So I've worked on improving myself to be a better person and attract the kind of guys I'm attracted to.	Sounds like you need to lower your standards. I mean, maybe this doesn't affect your dating life, or you don't care if you're single, but people usually date people that are a similar "rating" of attraction to them. Yes, exceptions happen, but it's rare. Anyone who feels like this usually either needs to lower their standards or make themselves more attractive (lose weight, take are of their appearance, wear make-up, etc). For me, people who are even just moderately attractive become more attractive as I spend time around them. And I'm not saying start dating an ugly dude in hopes he gets prettier with time. I'm saying that as I spend time with average looking people, I gradually find them more attractive over time. That's how attraction works with me. Then there are people who are instantly attractive also, but sometimes it's more because I've recognized my type.	1
Does age matter?	Hmm, I'm 29 and my SO right now is 20. There are some problems, with life experience and stuff, but he's good for me at this point in my life. Whether that will continue to be the case remains to be seen, I guess. It's the biggest age gap I've ever had in a relationship. To be honest, one of the main things that bug me about it are my asshole friends. Most of my friends will gently tease me about it, just here and there and it's just them being cute. I do have a few friends, though, where I think they WANT it to come off as cute gentle teasing, but it doesn't come off that way at all - it comes off as just...Straight up making fun of me. But they're shitty friends, I guess, and I should drop 'em. =P	It definitely can matter. I believe its more about your stage in life than your numerical age, but that rarely changes things. Occasionally yes, you can meet a 25 yr old who is VERY mature, maybe was already married young, who already has a house and job who is further in their life development than average 25 year olds and they could easily get along with someone in their 40's. But generally, if there is a big gap between age stages (i.e. college grad, just moved out of home for the first time, hooking up with 45 yr old who has two teenage children, an ex wife, is at the top of their career etc...its a HUGE gap to bridge, and I don't think if often works out well in the long term).	0
If a man wants his to-be-wife to take his surname otherwise he won't get married, do you think that makes him sexist?	Not at all. My husband was pretty adamant about it and after hearing his reasoning, I don't think it's sexist at all, I think its a nice tradition and a man, or anyone else, is okay to want that for his family	Since praise is hard to come by in this sub, I wanted to point out that I think OP is doing a wonderful job of expressing disagreement without being dismissive or antagonistic. This is an interesting thread. Well done.	0
Experienced ladies, what is something you wished older women had told you when you were younger, like in your early twenties?	If a handsome and intriguing man tells you that he's incapable of intimacy, *believe him*. Believe him and run screaming into the night!	No one, and I mean NO ONE, is paying as much attention to you as you think they are. That insecurity you feel? Yeah, everyone around you has just as much of it as you do. Stop worrying about how you seem to others and just do your thing. Edit: our usernames should have tea together.	0
How do you feel about Cassandra Fortin, the 17-year old who was forced into chemotherapy against her will?	As her mother seems to be backing her choice, I'm not sure what six months of forced treatment will do for her. It seems both she and her mother are on board with stopping treatment as soon as she hits 18 anyhow. I would guess they will be especially against further treatment after making this six months of treatment extra hellish. Plus strapping people down and forcing medicine into them seems inhumane. I think both she and her mother are likely very wrong about the odds of her survival without medical intervention. I also tend to be of the mindset that at a certain point you give people a rope and decide if they want to pull themselves up with it or hang themselves. If she and her mother want to pick the latter, that's on them.	Some people need to be protected from their own stupidity or ignorance, I guess. Once she's eighteen I suppose no one can stop her, but it's sad if she actually wants to live but dies because she believes in ineffective treatment methods.	1
What things do you constantly do the 'wrong' way, but work for you?	I haven't studied for any test or quizzes since 3rd grade. I somehow still manage to get B or higher all the time.	Everything gets washed warm and I don't separate my colors/lights/darks. It all turns out clean and nothing is ruined. VOILA.	0
Does anyone else think of getting dressed up as "putting on your hot girl disguise"?	Hahaha! This question made me laugh a lot. I really like dressing up and so I think of every situation like a costume (rather than a disguise). I would get as excited to go to an ugly sweater party as a cocktail party because I would still have to plan an appropriate "costume". I want to wear a white dress for my wedding not cause I am traditional but because that's what the bride costume is. I hate wearing white in all other situations.	Personally I dress up enough to look cute. I find that girls that actively try to look 'hot' tend to end up looking like they are trying to hard. I'm a jeans and t-shirt girl. If everything fits well and looks classy, the cute girl outshines the girl in high heels and a mini every time (in my opinion).	1
Do any of you suck at making lady friends like I do?	Bingo! Right here... I just get along better with men. I'm always so concerned I'll say the wrong thing to women. And I can't get into the whole "Your dress looks lovely!", "Where did you buy that purse ?", "so and so did this and that". Not saying that all women are like that or that there isn't an equivalent with guys... but in my experience men talk about funny things more... and that's my comfort zone. Just today a male co-worker joked about cutting his wrists... I told him to make sure he goes up and down, not across. Hilarious!	I'm the same way. I easily make acquaintances and have a hard time making close friends. For me, it seems to be that women want to bond with each other by being emotionally open. BUT, I want to be emotionally open AFTER we've bonded (this is the male "friendship progression", it seems to me). I feel like that makes other women think I don't like them! It's not truuuuuue.	0
What's the most inappropriate non-sexual thing a coworker has told you?	This is sexual but it's not harrassment. I had a co-worker whose husband had a micropenis and was a terrible lover. I *really* didn't want to know anything about his junk or imagine both of them having sex. Sometimes she'd start crying in the middle of work and I'd try hard to avoid her so I didn't have to listen to micropenis stories. Same co-worker had a smooth tongue (?) she was always talking about. Sometimes she'd stick it out and demand that we inspect it. It made everyone uncomfortable. She also frequently cried about her tongue.	"I don't like black people." I didn't even know this woman's last name. Also "ugh my crotch smells like fish". Lady I don't even know what department you work in!!	1
In what ways are you kinda creepy?	Sometimes I'll remember a random person from my past, try to find them on facebook, and, if I'm successful, stalk literally everything they've posted. Just idle curiosity, I swear.	I regularly tell my SO I'm going to poke holes in condoms so I can trap him forever and since we're long distance it'll mean he HAS to move to me sooner. He knows I'm joking.. or am i?	1
Girls, women, ladies; what does sexual attraction feel like?	It's a *want* to touch and to feel them. You're semi-listening to the conversation around you, but you're mind is focused on staring at them and wanting to get close. Intrusive sexual thoughts mingle with the rational part of you. It's both annoying and exciting.	Find it difficult to answer that one as I have a pretty low sex drive myself. Top commenter did it well. But I have a question - as an asexual person, what's the deal? Do you just, like, not have sex?	1
How many of you drink coffee in the morning simply because it makes you poop before you leave the house?	Uh, if coffee is supposed to keep me regular then it has failed. I drink coffee because it's delicious and perks me up.	I drink coffee because I like the taste and the caffeine. Regular and consistent bowel movements are just a bonus.	0
Beard lovers, have you ever had a man you're attracted to shave his off... only for you to discover he wasn't so cute under all that hair?	My boyfriend's mom had never seen her husband (BF's dad) without his beard. One day he shaved it off after losing a bet, and she made him promise to never shave his beard off again.	You know, I tend to think if a guy isn't sexually attractive without a beard then he isn't sexually attractive. Just like if a girl looks like a 10 with makeup but a 4 without. She isn't a 10 then.	1
Ladies: if there's a piece of advice you could share with the whole male population, what would it be?	All the stereotypes thrown at women are projections because really apply to men - men are the hormonal beasts, men are quick to flip out, men have delicate feelings and are unpredictable	When a woman is mad or acting grumpy or whatever, assume she has a valid reason. Never ask her if she is on her period at these times--to do so is a surefire way for her to get even more mad at you. Besides, to assume that her feelings are irrelevant based upon whether or not she is on her period is pretty douchey.	0
What are some effective ways for deescalating an argument in your relationship?	I pay attention to my heart rate. If it's really fast, I'm probably not in the right state of mind. So I excuse myself and do some slow breathing until I feel calmer. At that point it's easier to really listen. My partner's also good at excusing himself if he needs a minute to calm down. Neither of is get offended when the other needs a minute. We understand the reasoning. Also, sometimes, just saying "I'm angry but I still love you" helps. It's a reminder that we're still on the same team.	I've always found that stopping for a snack usually helps. I swear most unnecessary arguments start because people are hungry.	0
What's he fastest you've ever brought a man to orgasm? How did you do it?	About a minute and a half. I have had them come quicker but this one made me the most proud. It was round two that night. We were in the spooning position and I was kegeling while twirling my hips. I just heard a lot of heavy breathing in my ear and he had a death grip on my hip, which made it super hot. I let out a moan and bam! He was done. He was embarrassed but I loved it. It was a huge ego boost.	As a guy (ignore username) sometimes I last a good 30min to an hour, other times I'm a two pump chump. I usually go down on her first, get her there, which takes the edge of performing solely for her, then we can just basque in the glory of mediocre to kinda good PIV (I kid, it's actually pretty hott). If I last a while, and get her off again during PIV, it's win win. If I last shorter than a trident commercial, she's turned on by how quickly she got me off and takes it as a compliment. Either way, high fives and cuddling take place after.	1
What does your SO do that makes you feel like they actually care about you, you're special and important to them?	He validates my anxiety. Such a simple thing, but no one in my family really fully grasps what happens to me physically when I am anxious. He rubs my back to distract me from my anxiety and sings me to sleep when I'm feeling panicky. The validation alone is the single most important thing to me.	If I ask him to, he'll feed/change the baby. He supports us. I'm a SAHM. Occasionally he'll text me with "I love you" or something like that. Here and there, he'll ask if I need anything.	1
What is the most annoying humblebrag you've ever heard?	"You cannot imagine what a bore it is, having to go to the Caribbean again. Now that the villa is paid off, it would be criminal not to go on holiday there, but it's gotten old. You're so lucky not to have a second house, it's nothing but a headache." My sister's brilliant insight.	I'm more annoyed by petty jealousy than if someone is feeling good about themselves. In my book, go ahead, brag, feel good about yourselves. You earned it, or even if not, you got it.	1
Has anyone else noticed any words that tend to be used differently across genders?	I think respect often has different connotations between the genders. Women seem to more often use it to mean being treated with dignity and common decency, something that should be extended to everyone because it's good manners or even just good morally. Whereas men seem to more often use it to mean something more like admiration, it's something you have to earn before it's given to you, more of a status symbol.	When men say they don't like women who wear make up, they mean they like women who wear natural looking make up.	1
What unwanted advice have you received lately?	A resident at the retirement community told me to smile more or else I'll end up like her. Out of fear I smiled more because I don't want to end up like her.	i mentioned being fat and someone was just like YOU NEED TO CUT OUT PROCESSED FOODS AND SODA AND EAT MORE VEGETABLES AND LESS GARBAGE AND TRY TO PICK UP A HOBBY LIKE RUNNING OMG EAT CLEAN AND BE HAPPIER!!! AND HEALTHIER!!!! i ignored it. because really the assumption level in the comment was dumb a hell.	1
Is it weird I feel more insecure about my bf looking at /r/gw than if he were looking at hardcore porn?	I can understand how you feel. It's way more personal. I don't care what my bf jerks it to, but if he was having conversations with girls he's jerking it to, I'd feel a little betrayed. That's crossing a line for me. That's why gw is a problem for me, not because it's amateur, but because those girls are able to talk back. They aren't just pictures, they're people. And I expect to be the only person in my bf's sex life during a relationship.	I think you're just being insecure. It's just another form of porn. As long as he isn't interacting with them I don't think you should care. I know I don't. Interacting with them is where the line is for me.	1
Are there any questions that you've wanted to ask someone of a particular ethnicity (that isn't your own), but haven't been able to?	Why do black women criticize other black women who get weaves saying they are whitewashed? Why do lots of black people call other fellow blacks "Whitewashed" if they speak properly and aim to have a nice job and nice life? Why so many single moms in the black community? Only asking questions to people who have seen the aforementioned things happen, no I am not generalizing I have just seen it happen lots of times to deduce it was not an isolated case and I wanted to know. European here, so I get my information from the internet. Thanks :D	YES and it's a really dumb one and I don't know how to ask it without sounding like a goddamn racist, but here goes: I'm a lawyer and I have noticed that black men and women tend to wear formal hats more often than any other given ethnicity. Particularly men. I've wondered why wearing hats with suits has become more and more uncommon (to the point where when I see a white guy in a suit and a hat my knee-jerk reaction is UGH DOUCHE) in the "white world" but that it has continued to be fashionable and appropriate in the black community. I've never known how to ask that without saying something utterly idiotic. Not sure I accomplished it here. To be clear, I have absolutely no objection to black men dressing however they damn well please. I just always wondered if there was a historical or sartorial significance.	0
Ladies, imagine you've just started dating a guy who says he's never really had a girlfriend before. What things are you worried about?	It depends on the guy's age. University age? Totally normal to have never had a BF/GF before, and I wouldn't be worried about anything. Even into the mid 20's it's somewhat normal. Beyond the mid 20's, I'd see it as a red flag.	I married that guy - he never had a girlfriend before me. You know what? It really depends on the person. I didn't have time to worry at all as he never came across as inexperienced, nor did he do any stupid relationship BS, so I forgot he didn't have girlfriends before me. Actually treated me better (why I married him) than all the other guys I dated. He is mature in personality and had his life shit together. Latter probably the key factor.	0
What's you're top 5 non-negotiables and why?	I have found over the years that many of the things I thought of as non negotiable end up being negotiable with the right person (e.g. allergic to cats, has depression, uses tobacco products). That said, I do think there are traits that I require in a partner. They are: -Must be dedicated to being a kind and compassionate person above all. Must be central to their world view. -Must have the capacity for joy and silliness and being goofy. -Must be very physically affectionate and love cuddling and have a strong and exploratory sex drive. -Ongoing intellectual curiosity, thought, complex inner dialogue that translates to fascinating conversations together. -Must be absolutely committed to being PARTNERS; to listening to my needs and preferences too and being willing to incorporate them equally and fairly into our life circumstances and future plans.	1. Feminist 2. Must love cats 3. Must be passionate about something 4. Must have an open mind 5. Must not be extremely religious edit: awwwww does someone not like my number one? ;)	1
What wine do I pair with grilled cheese?	I would seek out your local homebrew shop, find out if they have an adventurous community forum, and ask if anyone has a bottle of tomato or beet wine. If in the pacific NW, there's a pretty good chance you'll be able to barter for one. Otherwise, a yeasty cider is the best suggestion I've seen so far. fruity, to complement the cheese, bready to pair with the bread, and acidic and carbonated to break up the grease in your mouth.	cheap pinot grigio. It will cut through the grease, and then you can afford to have two bottles. I used to like to drink mine out of that one plastic tumbler in the back of my cabinet because all of the other glasses are dirty.	0
I just had to cut off the head and feet of a frozen chicken. Why do you need to cry today?	I cried because I emailed my assignment to my class educator 1 day before it was due, and then the day after it was due, a full 45 hours later, I got a "delivery failed email" I've spent my entire holiday saving screenshots and calling my school, trying to prove that I did everything I was supposed to do and it wasn't my fault. Yesterday I got the official "Nothing can be done, please re-enroll" email. I can't afford to re enroll both financially and in terms of time.	The guy I like lives on the other side of the planet and I can't see him until next year. 😭	1
Ladies, what do you dislike about your SO but put up with it anyway?	He can't watch TV or movies without falling asleep. He could be wide awake but it's really, really rare that he can get through a 40 minute episode. 10 minutes in, he's snoring. And then he will ask if we can rewatch an episode because he fell asleep and he wants to know what happened, but then he falls asleep AGAIN. I really hate it when he says "Want to go watch netflix?" Because it translates to "Want to watch me fall asleep and call it spending time together?" Ugh.	I wouldn't put up with that. Who gets angry about being asked to help out the one you love with something so banal like carrying heavy shit. My former SO used to drink a lot on the weekends. Almost every weekend actually. I put up with his drunk/hungover ass for a year before I got fed up with it and asked him to tone it down. He couldn't (or didnt really want to, who knows) so I ended things.	1
Have you ever fooled around or had sex with a guy friend? How did you relationship change?	I had this guy chase me all through high school. We became pretty inseparable and although I knew he probably had feelings I kinda ignored them and put him in the friend zone. However, even after high school he still clung on. After my first serious breakup, I decided to throw him a bone for all his years of faithfulness. I also knew it would be the kiss of death for our friendship. The sex was really good and it was exactly what I needed, a "friend" to help me move on from a really bad breakup, but he finally moved on too. I just think as a woman you should always be in charge and aware of the sexual environment. Like I totally KNEW once I gave him what he wanted for years, it'd be easy to get rid of him. Kinda fucked up, but I'm cold like that.	My current SO was my guy friend i fooled around with. We decided to be FWB, then "exclusive" FWB then said fuck it let's just get together.	0
Have you ever had issues with someone who had high emotional intelligence and could "read" you too well? Those on the other side, do you ever feel like you're being manipulative because of your gift?	I once dated a guy who had an incredible ability to relate to people. Charisma through the roof. He made me feel fantastic about myself, but I always maintained the slightest shadow of doubt about his sincerity. He told people what they wanted to hear. He was also a terrifyingly convincing bullshitter. Overall he was a good person, though. I'm just not sure I could have really trusted him in the long term.	I have actually caught myself pulling string and molding their will. It feels great. I feel like a super villain had sex with Sherlock Holmes and I'm that baby	1
Ladies, what has happened recently that made you feel pretty?	I had my lingerie party bridal shower thing this weekend, and got tons of cute, sexy things. Gave my fiance a fashion show when I got home and he just kept saying how lucky he is with a schoolboy smile :)	I had a *really* good hair day on Sunday, and lots of people saw it because of Super Bowl festivities. For a curly girl, that's a big deal!	0
Guy at my sandwich place asked me out...where do I get my BLT now?! What was the last awkward situation you were in?	Ugh the guy at the convenience store right by my apartment asked me out the other day and now I have to drive down the road to buy beer. So I know how you feel. Serious bummer.	Not lately, but at my old job I would get breakfast at a Chikfila regularly, and usually got the same guy. After a month or so, I guess he got up his courage and asked me a BARRAGE of questions at the drive-thru window. Where did I work? When? Until when? Was it nearby? When did I get off? When exactly? I kept answering really vaguely because I'm nice and I don't mind questions, but I'm also very private. I don't even tell friends where I'm expected to be during the day most of the time. He kept wanting to get more specifics, I'm guessing because he wanted to propose a date time, but I was like "wow look at the time, gotta go, bye" and NEVER RETURNED. Thanks for the weight loss from not getting breakfast there anymore, guy. Actually needed that.	0
What's something about yourself that you feel is constantly unappreciated or misunderstood?	I'm a gamer, and my job is modeling. Geeks are condescending towards models. Models are condescending toward gamers. I have no friends	One of the most hilarious realizations I've ever had was when it was pointed out that I'm seen as being a very laid-back person. I have an anxiety disorder, I'm prone to panic attacks, I'm high strung, and have recently realized I actually present most of the major markers for obsessive compulsive disorder (haven't pursued treatment or diagnosis though, so it's just a theory at this point). I think I come across as very chill because I'm constantly trying to maintain some sense of calm, but nobody sees the constant internal screaming and panicking that's happening in my head. Edit for clarity: the possible OCD diagnosis is not something I've checked into, however the anxiety and panic disorder are diagnosed, medicated, all that jazz.	0
What are the funniest/weirdest fashion comments you've received from your SO?	We were both in the bathroom one day getting ready for the day and I decided to put my hair half up. As I'm gathering it up and smoothing it out, I secure it with a little clip. I notice he's staring at me with this weird look on his face. I ask him what's wrong and he said, "I always thought that was a clip on hair piece...that's actually your hair?" I lost it. Apparently he thought whenever girls had their hair half up, it was some sort of weird clip on hair toupee for women.	"I like the color of that dress, but it's hard to explain. In some light, it looks green, in some it looks purple. It's grurple."	1
Do you get turned on or grossed out by nude men?	Honestly, unless the man is my boyfriend, I'm pretty neutral. By that, I mean, if I'm watching a movie or something and there's a nude man, I don't suddenly get turned on. I might notice if he's attractive or not, but I'm not suddenly raring to go to have sex. In general, however, I'm not a visual person.	Meh, sometimes. Depends on the mood I'm in. I definitely don't like seeing naked men in porn, it makes me feel icky.	1
I have grown tired of my daily dinner recipes. What is the one meal that is in your weekly rotation that you/your family loves?	I don't have the recipe offhand, but baked enchiladas are simple and delicious! Basically just need enchilada sauce, cheese, tortillas, and whatever you want to fill them with (I do vegetarian meat crumbles or sautéed veggies, but put meat in them when I cook for the family).	ITT: salt, sugar, fat, garlic. Not to say there's anything *wrong* with that. Add caffeine and you've got all the food groups.	1
Has anyone here fallen for someone whose personality won you over before their looks? Would you tell them? How would you feel if your partner made a similar statement about you?	I've never dated an Adonis. I go for a looks/personality combo, personality being more important. The last big crush I had before my current SO was a short, balding man. Why would I tell him that his personality was more important than his looks? There is no benefit to that.	Yes, absolutely. I'd probably not say that. If a similar statement were made to me, I'd probably be a little hurt. Look, I know I'm not a good-looking woman. I'd prefer that just be an unspoken truth between us; I don't need to have it acknowledged like I didn't know.	0
Have you ever been to a topless beach? What was your experience like?	It was GREAT! The feeling of the cool breeze against my bare chest felt like nothing else. Edit: I'm a guy.	I've been to a full-nude beach in Austin with my boyfriend. It was a little weird at first, but after about twenty minutes of being just another naked person you stop caring. Being naked outside is awesome.	0
Any women here whose periods/hormonal cycles have zero sway over their emotions?	Yeah, I cannot say that it really impacts my emotional state in some way that I feel overly emotional or let them run out of control. If anything, the only change in my personality is that I'm pissed off because I feel gross or in pain from the cramps and it is keeping me from getting things done like normal.	I am exactly like you. I've always wondered if some women play up the emotion thing, because I've bled for 35 years (not continually, obviously), and my emotions have never run amok because of my periods.	1
Anyone else with tactless Tinder dates?	A few months ago I went on a date with a guy from Tinder. It went really well, we got drinks then just hung out at his place and watched a movie, didn't do anything. Two days later he shows up at my work begging for me to come out to his car and suck his dick in exchange for pizza.	It's a hookup app. For hooking up. If you're expecting tact from horny guys on an app specifically designed for random hookups, you're gonna have a bad time.	1
What is a "yellow" flag for you in your relationships?	Too close of a relationship with his mother-I dated two different guys when I was younger whose mothers depended on them for a life and dealing with a constant meddling mother sucks. Their last relationship was really messed up-I'm 36 so a lot of guys I date have had long term relationships that went south. For example, one guy broke up and got back together with an ex he still spoke to more times than he could count. I assume he may get back together with an ex or he would rather walk out the door than work on a problem. Last minute cancellations with lame excuses. I let this one go about twice before it becomes a deal breaker. I've been a litigator for 10 years. The BS excuses some men expect me to buy is insulting.

Who else sucks at making new friends?	I seem to get along with people just fine, but after that really becoming friends, nope, it doesn't happen, also I became like a shitty friend since I got sick of trying to be a good friend to people and then just getting nothing in return. Most of the time I become friends with my girlfriends boyfriends since these are the people I see the most, but they (gfs) don't seem to like that.	I'm great at making casual acquaintances and I have NO fucking clue how to move from that to, like, actually making social plans with people.	0
Redditor girls on their late 20's/30s's: what would you do differently regarding sex, dating, guys, relationships on your college days, given the hindsight on life experiences you have now?	I wish I did not waste so much energy caring what I looked like naked. So many times when get frisky I would be worried about what my belly looked like in positions, or having visible cellulite on my ass and thighs. I could have had much better sex if I quit being self conscious. That was the biggest discovery for me in my late 20s. Once I learned that a dude enjoying naked time with me knows I am not a magazine dream queen and wants me anyway, sex got a whole lot better. Seriously. Embrace your body for what it is and the fun things you can do with it.	Maybe a bit off topic, but can we stop describing women as "girls", please? I would not call a male in his 30s a "boy", and there is no female equivalent to "guy". (The word "gal" immediately brings square-dancing to mind.)	1
Ladies who mostly use pads during your period - why? And do your friends give you crap for it?	I only use pads. I like pads more than tampons. I don't feel gross or feel like I am wearing a diaper. The only shit I get for being a pad user is actually from 2XC comments.	I find it funny how American women seem to be obsessed with tampons. I'm not American and I've always used pads coz the idea of having something stuck inside me all day long is not very pleasing.	1
Women who say "I don't get along with women"/"All my best friends are guys"--why? What's the mentality?	I don't say the first, but the second is true of me - and most of my friends in general tend to be guys. I have no idea why it is. I often feel intimidated or isolated from other women I meet, even if they're being friendly and inviting. I also tend to vocally share most of the same hobbies as the guys I encounter rather than the girls.	They've been influenced by sexism in our culture that sends the message that women are always catty, dramatic, and backstabbing. Also messages that girly things are stupid, lame, and a waste of time.	1
What are your best stories from attending a friend's wedding?	Well when my sister got married (also best friend status) she had this beautiful, modest but very chic and classy wedding where we were all dressed like we were going to a nice formal brunch and all the bridesmaids wore tea-length gowns and it was all so lovely and nice. Then ther father-in-law shows up with his shitty girlfriend and she's literally wearing lingerie as a dress and thigh-high boots. He also insisted she be in every family picture so all their wedding photos have these nice ladies and men in fancy brunch clothes.....and what looks like a call girl. I'm not trying to be mean or prudish, but she was so disgusting and innapprorpiate. My sister was pissed, I was pissed for her.	A good friend of mine got married about 7 years ago. She has this amazing red hair and pale skin and chose a very light green dress to get married in and looked spectacular. Her husband's mother had a fit and said that **someone** had to wear white and forced her son to wear a white suit. Not too much wrong with that as he looked kinda cool, but then she arrived in white herself. My chin was sore from dragging it around on the ground all night at the reception.	1
How/when did you know he/she was NOT the one?	When he told me that he didn't want to listen to sad love songs or any music that wasn't upbeat because it was bad for his mental health.	At one point during the relationship my ex said something like, "don't you think I'd be a good father?" After I thought about it I realized that he was one of the more immature, irresponsible people I knew with a bad temper and that he's not even a good boyfriend, let alone someone who should be parenting.	0
What's going on in your life that you feel like you can't talk to anyone about?	I don't feel like I have much to live for at the moment. I'm not suicidal or anything, but I know that's how it'd come off if I told someone. I just don't think I'd care much if I found out I was dying or something.	My ED is back. I feel like I'm in control of it but I know it's slowly taking over my life from the edges in. My mom is in denial about me having an ED, I don't want to put it on my best friend, and I don't want to tell my therapist because she'll make me talk about it and nag about stopping. This all started because I gained 30ish lbs after leaving an emotionally abusive relationship in August, which I'm still reeling from. Ugh.	1
You suddenly find yourself in a magical world where you can eat anything and not gain weight. What do you eat, and how much?	I would eat so many carbs! Pasta and rice and poatoes all the way! I don't love junk food that much, but I tend to overdo it on portions of normal food.	I think I'm already living in that world. Eating too much or anything too greasy gives me stomach ache rather than making me gain weight. I avoid fatty food like the plague.	1
Do you believe there is such a thing as "the one" for you?	No. Perfect monogamy is a by product of Victorian industrialisation to support the male in his "duty" to work. Many cultures live poly amourous and inter sex lives/identities without a problem.	No, just mathematically speaking. I do think that each person probably has a small group of people they'd be excellently suited for, and a larger circle of people they'd still be pretty damn happy with.	0
Would you rather be able to eat as much as you want and not gain weight or never have your period?	Eat. Definitely eat. My period is hell, but it's only a few days a month and will stop eventually. Eating is for life.	Well I already have the first one. I can eat whatever the fuck I want and not gain weight. And before you go OMFG THAT'S AWESOME, YOU'RE SO LUCKY! Think again. I constantly battle with being underweight and my body, even at 25 years old is under developed and featureless because of it. I'm flat, no curves, and maintaining anything of my weight is a struggle. Sure I can shove whatever I want down into my gut, but I'm not attractive in anyway.	1
Do you have any "forever alone" type female friends who are over 25? If so, what are the factors, honestly, that you think are holding them back?	Up until last year, it was me; I'm 32. I'm aware that I'm a bit scary looking, I'm on the autism spectrum, and I'm very smart and have a strong personality, and I do nothing to dim those things down in any way because I refuse to lie to anyone who wants to be my friend. I don't consider that any of this was "holding me back" - my singleness was a choice, just as my now togetherness is a choice, made of my own free will and for reasons I don't have to explain or justify to anyone. To have it suggested that I was somehow doing something to prevent my own happiness is a bit insulting, OP.	Not being honest with herself or guys about what she wants. She's 29 and wants to settle down, but she keeps meeting guys on Tinder and getting hurt when they want to keep things casual. I think she's trying to keep up with younger people in our graduate program and gets sucked into "hookup culture," even though that's not what she wants.	0
I put on tights this morning and felt like a beached whale wrestling a fish net. Ladies, what is your least graceful moment of the day?	I teach six-year-olds and have been having TERRIBLE gas lately. Fortunately, I am able to fart silently. Unfortunately, my farts smell DISGUSTING! The kids started to look like they were going to cry and kept accusing each other of "pooping". Shit.	Shaking a full bottle of liquid acrylics, the cap came flying off and doused me in Burnt Sienna #7020. All over my face, in my hair, and on my shirt. I looked like I got bukakka'd.	1
(Possibly NSFW) Who is the creepiest girl you know? What makes her creepy?	I had a friend who was very envious of my life. I was an overachiever, won many awards, I was likable, had many friends, had style, and tall and pretty. She was unfortunately the butt of everyone's joke, resembled shrek (I wish I was kidding...) and overall an obnoxious and loud person. We had similar interests so we remained friends. She went behind my back and told my boyfriend she was in love with him, she cried and admitted to cutting the word "fat" into her skin when I happened to change in front of her during a trip. It sucks she had such low-self esteem but she made me feel very uncomfortable in many situations. For that, she is the creepiest girl I know.	In highschool j had a neighbor girl that would come to my window and watch my friend and I watch tv. We'd see her reflection on the TV and stop talking.... she'd just stand there.	0
Are you Team White/Gold or Team Blue/Black?	I don't understand how someone could see this the other way... How does this work? edit: I suspect this is just trolling, and certain users are in on the joke, and no one has spilled the beans yet. >___> edit #2: OH MY GOD, holy fuck! I just glanced away for awhile, saw the post of the blue dress someone else posted, and then glanced back at the OP, **and the dress was blue and black this time**. Though it quickly faded back to being white and gold. Try looking at a clearer picture of the dress, with OP's picture in your periphery. I can force myself to see the dress as blue if I do this.	Wait, some people see this as blue and black? That... freaks me out. Where's the black part? I really only see gold and white.	1
Wonderful women of reddit, do you also enjoy "sniffing" your BF's male scent when cuddling or otherwise being physically close to him?	I'm the same way. His whole body smells amazing, but it's most concentrated in his chest, neck, and armpits. Looooove snuggling up into his chest hair when we're sleeping so I can just inhale his scent. :3	Yup. My SO's scent is both a crazy turn on and gives me a general feeling of comfort. I love it.	0
What crazy things have your mother said to you?	* Lock your bedroom door at night. Men can't control themselves. * Having sex changes a woman because something goes inside her. It's not the same for a man because nothing goes inside them. * On their wedding night, if the man finds out his bride isn't a virgin, he won't want her anymore. They'll get divorced and she'll never find anyone else to marry her. * Don't marry a Japanese man * or a Mexican man or a black man or a Korean man. * The man shows his love by buying her presents and paying for dates. The woman shows her love by accepting his marriage proposal.	Wrong gender, but in 2012 my father told me that I "ruined my mothers birthday" for having multiple panic attacks because of guilt (I did something bad but was hiding it) that evening and locking myself in the laundry room for a while while my Mom freaked out about me. He has since then fully apologized, but its still something I'm never going to let go. Its not even that bad, what he told me. But it still, well, stays.	1
If you wanted kids and your partner had a limited supply of sperm, would you be willing to go through an In Vitro Fertilization cycle to maximize your odds of conception?	Never. I am personally against IVF, and this applies to all reasons why a person would be contemplating it. There are so so many children in this world without parents, and if for whatever reason you are unable to have a child of your own but are so driven to become a parent to a child, I do not understand why adoption isn't first on people's minds. If I or my partner were unable to conceive of a child, this is the route we would be taking.	In vitro is actually really intensive on the mother. Drugs, invasive tests, all kinds of stuff, and it's very expensive. You're better off doing doctor assisted intrauterine insemination. There are ways to test ovulation to do the insemination at (ostensibly) the best time to potentially conceive. Or if you're wanting to play it fast and loose, you could get your goods from the storage place and do the deed at home in private. IVF should truly be a last resort. Lots of other options that will likely work and be significantly less invasive and expensive.	0
What was the turning point that led you to decide for or against having children?	People should only have children if they want them more than anything else. Women who want kids describe it as a relentless imperative and they will climb mountains to conceive. What I hear from you is ambivalence, which is fine, but means "no" in this scenario. Also, your husband wanting two kids who will play together sounds a bit like he's expecting that having two will reduce the amount of time you need to spend watching/entertaining them--which it doesn't. I never wanted kids and my ex said he was ok with that but he changed his mind. He later remarried a teacher who doesn't want kids because she's around them all day. if being around kids is enough, then it should stay that way. If you need a child more than anything, go for it.	It's a little morbid, but I realized that I wanted children right after my mother died. Up until then, it was more of a 'eh, if I get pregnant then it isn't the end of the world, but no big deal if I don't' However, about a month after she died (she was 52 and I was 27) I realized that I really wanted children. I've talked to some other people and they told me the same thing, realizing the strong desire for children after the death of someone close.	0
What are your best AND worst online dating stories?	Worst: We decided to meet for dinner at 7. he was an hour and 45 minutes late. His reason? He was at the gym doing leg day in the single squat rack in the gym, a personal trainer asked him to move so his client could work in, he refused and stood his ground in the squat rack, after 30 minutes of arguing gym management called the police to arbitrate the situation. And after all that he still had to finish his squats because priorities.	Worst: started texting a guy I had matched with on Tindr. This was during my "fuck it I do what I want" phase, and I sent him videos and pictures of me, including a clip of a video of me blowing someone. I broke it off because he became extremely jealous and possessive after not even 3 weeks. He ended up sending the guy I blew the video I sent (which he knew was taken since he had held the phone). A couple of weeks later he texted me saying he'd pay me to blow him. I got mad, of course, and refused. He said unless I did it, he'd release my stuff. Said a bunch of lies about how he was still talking to the other guy and how they both had girlfriends and we're just using me. I ended up going to the cops.	1
Just broke up with SO of a year, and he didn't even react. Has anyone else has a similar experience?	Not everyone processes emotional trauma in the same way. A friend of mine is a trauma surgeon. Sometimes he has to be the one to deliver the bad news to husbands, wives, parents, family members and loved ones. He’s told people their child has just died and received nothing back but a blank stare. Or seen people react to the bad news with seeming indifference. And he’s seen people become hysterical to the point they had to be medicated. In each case, I doubt it was that they didn’t care their child, wife, husband, etc., had just died. People just process trauma in different ways, and the same may well apply to your situation.	Why would him feeling bad make you feel better? You ended the relationship. If you had unfinished business you should have taken care of that before you decided to break up with him. Sorry for being blunt, but I have little patience for people who use breakups as a way to manipulate their relationships, which is what it sounds like you tried to do.	1
Did dating get better in your 30s?	I met my husband after I turned 30. I told him on our second date that "this will sound crazy, but I want to be married and have babies soon. If you're on that track, then we can continue dating. If not, we need to cut this off." Edit: We were married(courthouse) 9 months later, wedding 1.25 years later, and pregnant 3 months after that. I GOT WHAT I WANTED!	This thread and the infertility thread are making me onion-eyed. I just turned 30, and am single for the first time as an adult. I stuck it out with the wrong people for too long. Despite being in a large metro area I'm having very little success with online dating. I want to marry and have kids, but my optimism is rapidly diminishing.	0
Has a guy you liked ever been oblivious to your hints, signs advances?	Man here. Can confirm anecdotally. I am oblivious to everything in the romance sector. That being said, it's so awesome/ hot/ sexy/ amazing when the woman makes the first move. That is if I see it.	My boyfriend. Sooooo many hints. I'd stay up way late with him after our Shadowrun game when everyone else went home or to bed, just talking and cuddling him on the couch... things like sex and porn and books and future plans and how pretty he is... One time, I indicated that spanking was something I like, and he slapped my ass... platonicly. Just when I was about to give up, his roommate told me to just ask him out. I did, he said yes (after he figured out what I was saying) and we've been together almost a year now.	0
Women who have done, or are doing nude modeling, stripping, camshows, porn, prostitution, etc. (jobs primarily aimed at pleasing men sensually/sexually), how has your view of men changed from before you started this work, to now?	I cam from time to time, and it shocks me how if you aren't attractive enough, then nobody will pay to watch you no matter how horny or willing you are. Personally I get quite a lot of attention whilst on the site, but I still get the odd men who click on and off without so much as a 'sorry, but you're not it for me' and it makes me think men are so much more shallow that I originally thought. Also it seems that once they've had their fun, they leave without so much as a thanks, bye. It's quite upsetting!	I've worked as a stripper since I was 17, and yes after a while it starts to distort your view of men a little bit. You get so used to seeing men at their worst. The majority of men who come to strip clubs are in relationships or married, and they always try to get something "extra" out of the lap dances, so sometimes I have a hard time believing that men are capable of being faithful. It makes me nervous to get involved romantically with any guy. I try not to let it affect me but its hard after a while. So many of my coworkers are jaded and hate their customers, especially the ones in their 30s who have been doing it their entire adult life.	0
Has anyone heard of the term "starter wife"? Is it a thing that actually happens?	I WAS A STARTER GIRLFRIEND. I didn't know it was a thing, omg. It makes sense. I MADE HIM. He was a super shy, useless virgin when I met him. Could barely talk to his own family shy. Never had a job or made himself useful at all. I got him his first car, I kept it maintained, made appointments, got his car insurance, made him amazing in bed, got him a job, got him in school, helped him with his second job, organized the buying of our house, took care of WVERYTHING. Got him his new car, helped him make a savings account and then 'I'm moving out don't love you bye'. FOR A YOUNGER GIRL. I FEEL BETTER.	I know a few women who were starter wives. I feel pretty bad for them because, as far as I can tell, their main offense was growing old.	0
Ladies: What is your beauty "hack"?	Using good skincare. Not drugstore brands, actual professional products. Makes all the difference. Worth the investment especially if you wear makeup on a regular basis. I switched to Eminence Organic Skin Care and I'll never go back. And also coconut oil. Awesome for a deep conditioner, body moisturizer, oil pulling (in your mouth), eye makeup remover etc etc!!!	My hair is naturally wavy but every time I let it air dry it would just get frizzy and wild. I learned that when I pat my hair dry with a towel it causes the frizz. So now I use an old t-shirt to help soak up the extra water..... no more frizz! Just pretty beach wavy hair. Something about the fabric of a t-shirt being less rough and harsh than a bath towel.	0
My work just upgraded from Office 2003 to 2013. What's the last thing at your job you got excited about?	I gave notice at my work because we were moving out to a new city across the country solely for the lower cost of living. My company asked me to stay on and work remotely. So now I make a good salary in a super cheap area plus I work from home in my pajamas with my cats. Prior to that it was probably when they got a Keurig and I could make so many teas and coffees and cocoas! But then they took that away and got a regular coffee pot, so that was a sad day.	I walked into work, and there was a baby shower held for a few pregnant coworkers. There was Chick-fil-a and Chipotle catering. I thought I died and went to heaven.	1
What is something (significant or silly) that all of your exes seem to have in common?	Throwin in my 2 cents- I seem to end up with busty blonde artists that have Elizabeth somewhere in their name. Weird thing is, I'm generally more attracted to technically inclined brunettes. Dunno why the opposite keeps happening.	Ok this is really weird but I was thinking about this exact question a few months ago and I have never dated anyone with divorced parents. I really don't have a physical type and they are as different as can be in terms of personality, but all of their parents are still together.	0
What are your experiences with "White Knights" and/or "Nice Guys" like?	I play a lot of Xbox, particularly CoD. I always end up hearing a couple of "nice guys" try to defend my honor against trash talkers. It gets on my nerves. I don't need them to defend me espcially when I start the trash talking, have a good comeback, and am in the top 5 in the lobby.	I don't think I have much experience with them at all. I'm always careful to not lead guys on so I feel like I never had any of them be into me. I'm too aloof for them.	1
Does seeing other people's lives play out on facebook ever make you depressed?	Not at all. My feed is full of drama from extended family and friends. Most live in a tiny town, so it's town drama. Uncle J found out that his wife is sleeping with half the town...again, cousin A is in jail...again, and Aunt L has recieved her 3rd cancer diagnosis (made by the lady she gets herbal remedies from, not the doctors.) I ignore what gets posted by all but a select few. If I'm having a rough day, I log on and remind myself that no matter how hard things are, I'm not as screwed up as they are. It makes for a great laugh, and it works better than a shot of liquor.	Something to keep in mind: Facebook is the curated collection of people's greatest hits. People post things that will make their lives look awesome. That glosses over all the boring, normal, and terrible shit that happens day-to-day. That said, it might be best to ignore status updates for those people. Or go cold-turkey on Facebook altogether. I had to do that when I was unemployed for a while.	0
If you've had an abortion, what advice would you give to a person who is contemplating one?	I've had 2. One surgical, one medical. My advice would be to make sure you have someone you can talk to about it and who can also hopefully join you on the day for support. If you are having a medical abortion (pill) , you will likely have heavy bleeding for up to 2 weeks after, be ready with lots of pads and iron rich foods. It is a personal choice and hopefully you don't have anybody pushing you in a certain direction. Do what you want to do, make the choice you feel is best for you and your life. I fell pregnant on 2 separate occasions despite being on birth control both times. Accidents happen and I don't regret my decision to terminate my pregnancies at all. I wish you the best of luck no matter what you choose :)	Do it. It's one day of unplesantness compared to nine months of pregnancy, permanent changes to your body, and your life never being the same again. It's horrifying to me that I could have made the opposite decision and destroyed my life on a hormonal whim.	1
Have you ever wanted to take a break from life? Like take a break from it all and do nothing? Like go live with a friend that no one knows about and just be a bum for a year or 2?	I will do that this year. Have been planning it for a while. In a few months I will move to a village on a tropical island and do nothing for eight to ten months.	My dream is to have a hippie summer, packing myself, my fiance, and some friends into a bus and riding across the country, doing drugs and doing gigs/bartering for money, food, and goods.	1
How old were you when you had your first orgasm?	I was 19. It was my wedding night, and believe it or not, I was a virgin; it was my first time. It was a little bit before I had another one; I think I literally and figuratively just got lucky that first time (and was also super turned on).	Ha Me being a bit of a dummy thought boys could only masturbate. So my bf gave me my first at 23 then I basically copied his tounge motions with my fingers one night and well the rest is history.	0
Ladies in the dating world - does "Divorced" or "Never Married" make a difference to you?	Honestly at my age if you're divorced I put a line through your name on my mental list Never married is cool. I'm sure it depends who you ask though and their age or if they've bee divorced etc. I just feel like if you've married once and divorced you fucked up	I think the distinction could be useful because some people really don't want to deal with the potential baggage. Obviously not all divorces are the same but in general I would rather date someone who has not been married before. (However, not many people my age have been married and divorced, so.)	0
What is the worst misfortune that has befallen your vulva?	The tribulations of youth... Drunk in a field, and there was no bathroom. Wearing heels, I stumbled into the dark to take care of some business. Pants to ankles, crouched to the ground in a wobbly squat, I tipped over and thought "Fuck it, I'll just sit here and finish peeing." It wasn't until I went to pull up my pants that I realized the intense burn of the wrath of every member of the ant pile I had just pussy smashed as they bit my bits to bits. *Fuck* that sucked.	I got stung by a hornet who got in my panties while I was using the bathroom at my grandmas house. I was about to get married and we were working on our house next door. I was walking back to our house when it stung and I screamed and ran into our house and stripped off my pants in front of my mom stepdad and husband. All this and my mom still lectures me about taking pants off in front of husband!	0
Have you ever had a crush you absolutely did not want?	Definitely - my current crush is a co-worker. I like to be a professional person and I work in a professional environment so this kinda sucks. I mean, I like having a crush but not at work.	I have a crush on my personal trainer who has a gf! He's so hot haha it makes me sad that I'm over weight and feel like he'd never be interested in a curvy girl like me. Its an innocent crush nothing serious or heart wrenching but its terrible to feel like unattractive!	1
Pro-life ladies (or "reluctant pro-choice" ladies), what feelings and thoughts do you have when a woman miscarries?	I have had a miscarriage and I am 100% pro life as a result. From a biological point of view, a human being's life begins at conception because a new, unique human organism is created. When I was pregnant I was aware of this reality but when I lost my child and seen his face I understood it on a much more deep level. We need to extend human rights to ALL human beings. A pre born child or a human fetus is a human being and deserves the same rights as everyone else. That is my opinion!	I'm not sure if I should respond because I'm not sure if I qualify as "reluctant pro-choice".. To clarify, I consider myself pro-choice - I think that abortion should be legal, every woman should have that option. However, I do not *think* that I could have an abortion (I'm not 100% certain that I would never have one though). Does that qualify me as "reluctant pro-choice"? I would feel sorry for the parents when there is a miscarriage. Similar to you, I wouldn't think about the fetus at all - unless someone else brought it up. However, if the woman was far along when the miscarriage happened or it was a still birth, then I would feel sorry for the parents and the baby.	0
Girls, how much detail do you tell your girl friends about the guy after you've had sex with them?	This thread is terrifying. There are at least 2 people involved in sex. I feel like the other person should at least be consulted before private information about them is shared. They chose to share that part of themselves with you, not with your whole network.	I usually don't give details except to remark on the quality of the sex and my satisfaction with it. If something mindblowingly spectacular happened, I might be more graphic, but otherwise... not really. Also, I'm far more likely to tell detailed stories about my sexual experiences after they've ended, but even then, I might leave out specifics. "I once had sex with this guy that did [blank]..." I don't know. I rarely volunteer information just because, but a lot of my friends like to prod me for stories and advice, so I guess I share a lot more often than most other people in this thread are saying.	0
Singles Ladies of long periods of time (5+ years): How do you cope with the hard days?	I do not understand the need people feel to be in relationships. I know I am mostly unique in my feelings. I have been in serious relationships, the longest lasting 6 years, followed by 3 years. I’ve been single for about 7 years now. I have absolutely no interest in dating. I love being single. To me, a relationship is more work than it is worth. I do not like my thoughts and feelings to be “hijacked” by someone else. It gives the impression of happiness, sure. But I much prefer to rely on myself. Maybe I am selfish, though not a day goes by where I am upset that I am alone.	I've been single for all 24 years of my life. The only time it sucks is when I don't have close meaningful friendships.	0
What negative stereotypes do you fit into perfectly?	I'm bisexual and polyamorous. I can't do monogamy. And I have cheated before. I'm a feminist with hairy armpits - though I don't think that's bad... I'm latina and hot blooded.	I'm a ginger and my temper is epic. I don't have the short fuse redheads are supposed to I can take a lot before I go off, but when I do, it's time to duck and cover.	0
Do you get anxious when other people use your computer?	Yes. Occasionally my SO asks to borrow my phone to look something up because his isn't handy. I always insist on looking it up myself. He will also sometimes scroll through my pictures out of boredom. I have nothing worth hiding on my phone and I trust him completely but it's still extremely uncomfortable and I hate it. I am way more strict with my laptop. Absolutely no one touches it but me. It has more sensitive information like my personal budgets, work info, etc. I also save all of my writing on there and *nobody* gets to read anything I don't send them myself.	I get incredibly anxious. I've also just always been a paranoid person. As long as I am not using the internet for school/work, I will go on incognito mode. I do not use Microsoft Outlook and only check my email on the internet. And of course, I log off after every single time. I think I have a problem...	1
Have you ever dated a guy but when you saw him naked for the first time lost all interest?	I know I'm nitpicking, but it's a wom*an*, several wom*en*. They're pronounced very differently, woman is pronounced woman, women is pronounced like "wimmen". I see this mistake a lot on reddit, and it drives me up the wall! :)	No - if I'm getting naked with someone, I'm probably first nervous about my own body, and then just excited to be with them. If we're at that stage, then that Amy Pond quote probably already applies. > You know when sometimes you meet someone so beautiful and then you actually talk to them and five minutes later they're as dull as a brick? Then there's other people, when you meet them you think, "Not bad. They're okay." And then you get to know them and... and their face just sort of becomes them. Like their personality's written all over it. And they just turn into something so beautiful. EDIT: Added the quote to this comment as well as one below.	0
Hypothetical question: If a woman rapes a man and becomes pregnant with his child, do you think the man should be able to terminate the woman's parental rights?	I'd be in favor of that. She'd be too shitty a person to be a good parent anyway. And if she got jail time Id maybe even be okay with a forced abortion if the father wanted it, though that miiight be pushing it. I can't decide.	Yes, for sure. If there is a child of rape, the child should never be forced to live with or be raised by the rapist.	0
Ladies, do you have short or long hair and why?	I have long hair because I got tired of my short hair. Short hair is higher maintenance for me. Also long hair is warmer in the winter.	Long because it's low maintenance. My hair is curly and awful and when I have it short, I have to put time into actually styling it to not look ridiculous. When it's long I can just tie it back and I'm done.	0
What kind of things were you told growing up about virginity and purity?	The more I learn about how some parents and even schools go on and on about purity etc., the more grateful I am to grow up in a country where such religious indoctrination is really rare. I would have like some more about feelings in our sex-ed, but at least it was fact based and promoted safety. My parents never said much, because they sort of came to it after school did, but they always stressed that I should be sure to only be with nice people.	No one ever said anything about purity to me. I think that's more of an American thing and I'm in the UK. I was told about contraception by my mum, older sister and school, and told not to rush into anything but that was about it.	0
Have you ever had a day so bad that it stops being terrible and starts being funny?	Eh sometimes but a lot of them are rather demoralising so its not funny or even cynical funny more, "Fuck this thing called my life". I cannot specify but often it has to do with sicknesses, money or family drama.	Woke up to get ready for school. Put on a big pot of coffee so I could have some and there'd be leftover coffee for my parents. Go to get dressed. Come back and I forgot to put the pot back in the coffee machine, and for some dysfunctional reason the machine still made 6 cups of coffee all over the counter and the floor. Ugh! Clean it all up and make another cup to take to school. While walking into school: Drop my coffee mug and spill all coffee on the floor. Ugh! Go to the cafe on campus and buy a coffee, spilled it on my jacket. IM FUCKIN DONE. NAP TIME.	0
I wear F cup bras but have no cleavage. In what ways does your body confuse you?	I'm going to be shit on with down votes here, but I'm being serious. Are you overweight? I've noticed the same phenomenon you're talking about with overweight women, but I don't recall seeing it in women who are fit. That's purely anecdotal, I know. But if you ARE over weight, you might sew some changes in general and with the particular issue you're talking about if you went over to /r/keto or /r/paleo or something. If you're not overweight, my bad.	Often i feel like i have very little spatial awareness. I can open a door and then bam! walk into the damn thing. It's like my body has no idea where it is in relation to the objects around/near it. I can see the damn door just fine but 2 seconds later my face just smacks into it. I need proximity sensors.	0
What is your problem?	i am very prone to bad (excessive) habit forming, in terms of food, weed, anything that I get enjoyment out of. "this feels good... why not do it all the fucking time?" is usually how my brain operates.	I have no idea what I'm doing with my life - I procrastinated too long to apply to some of the schools I was going to, and most of the jobs I am interested in require a PhD. Or a security clearance I can't get due to my citizenship. Or both. So basically I've made a number of *very bad decisions* in the past 4 years because I didn't have a plan, and now it's too late to fix them. Woo! Oh, and my therapist brought up antidepressants this morning. Mostly to tell me it would probably be a good idea, but since I have no idea what I'm doing with my life she doesn't feel comfortable starting me on them because it's quite likely we'd have to discontinue and stuff. *What a time to be alive!*	1
Aside from the gates of Hell opening, how does your period affect you?	I get RIDICULOUSLY horny the day before/of and will do literally nothing but masturbate all day between bathroom breaks and if food is brought to me in bed. During the three days I have it I maintain a bit of that horniness to a lesser degree and have mild cramps. I also experience emotions 2fold which I find annoying.	It seems that about two or three days into my period, I start feeling really really really sick, way worse than any stomach bug I've ever had. I have no idea why this happens. It started happening very suddenly a bit over a year ago. Birth control is the only thing that keeps it at bay.	1
What's the meanest thing you've done without realizing to someone you liked?	There was a boy that I was really flirty with at school. I was kind of a "late bloomer" in terms of dating compared to my peers, I had bad self esteem and was kind of in disbelief that someone would like me. He asked me on a date and I not even told him no even though I was crushing on him hard, I thought he was making fun of me and I told him no fucking way ew gross fuck the fuck off. And then kicked him in the shins on his way out. Ok no, not the shins part, but that was probably what it felt like. I didn't realize until years later that he was probably genuinely asking and I felt horrible. I hope he's doing alright.	I asked the woman I was dating at the time to marry me over text message. We'd only been together 7 months, so I thought she'd know I was kidding. However, we'd known each other for ten years and already lived together (we were roommates first, maintained separate rooms because I snore), and she thought given all that I wasn't kidding. She said yes and sent me a ;) - I thought she was playing along - and by the next time I got a chance to actually talk to her that evening, she'd already told her parents, etc. Whoops.	1
Just took a cab, alone, the locks were shaved off, is the legal?	Creepy, to be sure, but not unheard of. You seem to taking this much more seriously than I think it warrants, but to each his own. If this bothers you enough to complain to the company and the police, try to see it from another perspective first; how would you resolve the issue they are trying to prevent? (Just food for thought. Not trying to invalidate you're feelings in the least.)	I definitely agree that it's sketchy and I certainly wouldn't want to ride in that cab. *HOWEVER*, if I had to guess at the motivation behind it, I'd bet that the driver is trying to avoid people who ride and run out on their fare.	0
What's the male version of "Basic" in your opinion?	Since "basic" is basically synonymous with average college to young adult ladies, basic for dudes would be * Gym shorts, sweatpants over gym shorts. Layer them just so, so that boxers, and gym shorts can be seen peeking over the sweatpants * Nike sandals, (those single strap velcro ones) * Nike Crew length socks. Especially with shorts! and those sandals. * NIKE FREE 5.0's!!! * North Face Apex Jacket / North Face Denali Jacket * Shaker Bottles or carrying around a full gallon of water. *bonus points for those wierd sippy water cooler ones * Ray Bans / Knockoff Ray Bans * American Eagle Jeans * Loves chanting "USA USA USA" * Snapbacks with the sticker left on * Sperrys * Formal events? Blazer with jeans and sunglasses. *edited to add a few things. I'm making this list thinking about my dear basic brother.	- obsessively talks about breaking bad/dexter/the walking dead - sloppy, ill fitting clothes his mom probably bought for him at Marshall's - spends hours a day gaming and considers it a core hobby - loves taco bell - proud about his atheist belief systems, probably a libertarian and will let you know about it. - "ironic" racism/sexism	1
My SO is currently trying to cuddle me to death. What adorable ways do your partners drive you crazy?	He always wants me to stop what I'm doing and kiss him at the most inconvenient times. Sometimes I get mad but I secretly love it. :)	He tickles me so hard I get an asthma attack. Then he laughs at me for not being able to breathe and then tickles me some more.	1
Does your dream lesbian wedding involve two tuxes, two dresses, one of each, or other clothing options for the couple?	I'm a femme who loves femmes. So two dresses. My idea for the aisle is either two aisles and we meet in the middle, OR one of us walks the aisle and the other one is raised up from an underground platform amidst a buncha smoke and laser lights.	Two dresses, but only if I get to pick out both dresses because I am a control freak with specific taste.	1
What is a technology that you initially scoffed at, but by now have fully integrated into your life, or generally accepted very positively?	Touchscreen phones. I always loved my Blackberry because of the full keyboard and then I got an iPhone and I even got bored of it because it didn't HAVE a keyboard, so I switched back to a Blackberry. I then caved and have had a touchscreen phone for about 4 years now.	I cannot think of any, really. I've always been super-into technology - got a cellphone first among my peers, have 7 computers for 4 people in the house, have a Kindle, a Nexus 5, a laptop... I am into technology and embrace most of it! I hope that never wanes and I'm always 'hip' with the newest stuff.	1
Have your siblings ever shared something with you that you really did not need or want to know?	Oh yes. My 25 year old brother tells me he wanks in the shower which is why he takes so long. My 26 year old brother announced at the Christmas dinner table that his fiancée has a large vagina.(He actually said it's like playing to an empty auditorium) My SIL told me and my Fiancé that she'd been fucked too hard and now she itches. Like, why do I/we need to know any of this?	My gay brother gave me WAY too much information about his relationship problems. I'm cool with the fact you're gay but don't ram it down my throat. Ahem.	1
What's one of your preferences/dealbreakers that would make Reddit angry?	If he asks me out, he must pay on the first date. If he doesn't, we won't have a second date. Also, he must be at least tall-ish, not overweight and not a gamer. But I don't think those are as controversial.	I won't date someone with a mental illness who isn't willing to get help and take medicine. I don't care, i'm not there to be an emotional pillar for them, it's just not something I want to do.	0
What double standards have you come across in your relationships, and how did you deal with them?	I hate it when if I'm out w/o my husband and kids people say something like, "your husband is babysitting the kids tonight." Nope, he's parenting. Just like I do when he's not around. Edit: patenting-->parenting	I'm pretty sure all the double standards in my relationship are to my benefit, so I don't want to think too hard about what they are or I might have to do something about them... I mean, my SO hasn't complained about any, so it's fine, right?	1
OK, so are wide leg pants back in or not? Is the fashion world lying to me? What trends have you been wary of?	I'm wary of most fashion trends that end up being super-trendy! Things I have said: * "I'll never wear ballet flats" * "I'll never wear skinny jeans" * "I'll never wear leggings" * "I'll never wear leggings as pants" * "I'll never wear maxi dresses/skirts" * "I'll never wear high-waisted pants" I wear all of these things. But I really don't like wide-legged pants! I don't see that changing, but looking back.... we'll see what happens in a few months.	I don't like winged eyeliner. I think its not the look that looks best on most people. Ugh don't shoot me Oh and normal bootcut flares jeans are always in style. They are cute. Jeans that are expensive jeans are always in style.	1
What do you think is the most harmful idea currently taught to girls?	Princess culture. There's nothing inherently wrong with fairy tales and stories about princesses, but I'm talking about the way those princesses are divorced from the context of the story and marketed/sold as just a gown and an attitude. There's nothing about working hard and being humble (Cinderella, Tiana), accomplishing a goal even though it seems unaccomplishable from where you start (Ariel, Mulan), showing kindness and warmth (Belle), establishing autonomy from your parents (Rapunzel, Merida), or any of the other *actual themes* of the stories; without context, Disney princesses serve no real purpose other than decoration. I really hate the way "everyone is a princess" is sold to little girls without the accompanying narratives of having positive qualities other than being pretty and wearing nice dresses.	The idea that sex is no big deal. Amongst adults, of course that's fine. But when you have little girls looking up to celebrities, who act as if sex is something casual...that's not good. And then you have little girls wearing these teeny tiny shorts, and crop tops?! We need to teach our girls to respect themselves, because if they don't no one will.	1
Queer women, what do straight people not understand?	Coming out, and how it's not just a one time 'I'M OUT' party. It's over and over and over again with everyone you meet and sometimes more than once with people you have met. Heterosexuality is a hegemony in our society and it *sucks*.	I've generally not have had issues with straight people. I've had issues with jackasses, but those are everywhere. I feel that this topic is assuming a divide that, like that, is only existing in the heads of a vast minority. Well. Opinions.	1
For those of you with mental health disorders, what would you like to get off your chest regarding your disorder?	Just because I have depression does not mean I'm *sad*. Actually I'm more ... nothing. I can't feel, can't care, can't really muster up the energy to have any emotions at all, besides maybe hopelessness at the fact that I can't really feel anything. When the depression is at its worst, being able to feel sadness would be considered an improvement. I hate that depression has the name it does, because in my experience it's so, so much worse than being sad.	I'd like to point out that Autism and Asperger's syndrome and all of the other lovely things on the spectrum are NOT DISORDERS. Autistics and Aspies are not worth less than normals. So stop implying that - I don't want your pity, I just want you to respect my boundaries.	1
Why do people keep spreading the belief that "women like douchebags"?	There are a lot of really good answers in this thread already, but there's another factor that comes in from time to time. Men with Dark Triad traits are often more successful with women. TRP and TRP-esque people mistakenly attribute this to "women liking assholes" but in reality, men with Dark Triad traits are just much better at being manipulators and actors than regular guys. Take someone like Ted Bundy or H. H. Holmes. Brutal serial murderers who had women flocking to them. Part of it was that they were good looking but a larger part is that Bundy and Holmes were very good at playing the part of a "perfect" man. Accounts of Holmes say that he was level-headed, never shouted at his wives or paramours, seemed to love children and animals, and was very doting and kind.	Other answers are pretty spot on. To add on my own views: - People see the woman the douchebag is sleeping with and think, "Women like douchebags." But no one sees the other 5 women he chases who don't give him the time of the day because they think he's a tool. - Men say that in hopes that if they really do want women, all they have to do is become a douchebag. They don't get enough sex as their current selves, so they hold up hope for sex when they do become douchebags.	0
What's your best "Don't let crazy stick his dick in you" story?	He cried after I sucked his dick the first time. He went home and prayed about it with his mom and fasted for three days. His conclusion was that it was okay if I wanted to suck his dick again because he was going to marry me, but we were 17 and I had no intention of doing either.	Is it weird that I went through the thread to see if anyone was talking about me? I'm pretty sure there is only one girl who might call me crazy, but we never had sex. Was just curious if any of the others thought I was crazy, and I didn't realize it.	1
Do Feminist Friends judge your monogamy?	No, I've never experienced this. What your friends are doing is invasive, rude, and presumptuous as fuck. Ask them why they think they have any say in how you structure your romantic relationships, and why they feel the need to judge yours when you've been more than accepting of theirs.	>Do Feminist Friends judge your monogamy? **NO.** If your friends express disdain over monogamy, then your friends aren't feminists, they're *tumblrinas*.	1
Why does it seem to be accepted that you can get divorced after 10 years of marriage and that's just life sometimes, but if you end things with a partner of 10 years you should never have wasted so much time on someone who wouldn't marry you?	Because marriage is treated as an end goal, so when you break up with someone before marrying them, it's a "failure" but when you divorce them it's not because you've met your goal of marriage. Don't really agree with that idea but that's the mentality behind it.	Marriage is just a ceremony. The amount of time people spend focused on that ceremony as a social determinant is just... Sad. It can be an awesome ceremony or it can be perfunctory, but it's just a ceremony. It's not a super mega promise, it's not "the next level of relationship", it's just a ceremony. If you are with someone for 10 years, you can feel it was wasteful, meaningful, or learning experience. It's probably a combo of all of them. Whether or not you performed a celebration some point in the middle, makes no difference.	1
Anyone else get incredibly turned off when a man talks about his "crazy" ex?	I've only dated one truly clinical example of crazy. Actual mental illness of some sort. But I've also dated a few more that I would also call crazy more casually. The things that I put into this scope. * Codependent level of neediness. * Raging jealousy, lack of trust * Manipulative, mind games, controlling There are many people who hit those marks. Sometimes it's reading too much Cosmo and believing the advice there is useful. Others, they are broken by a history of dating equally awful guys. There truly is a lot of brokenness, or crazy out there. Glad to be married and not still dating.	One crazy ex is ok, i have one and it makes for good stories. If they are all crazy and nothing is ever his fault, either he has bad taste or he is the problem, so multiple crazy exes is a turnoff for me.	0
What is that one shallow or seemingly trivial thing that annoys you in your relationship, and that you've considered breaking up with your SO over?	If I find myself constantly having to lower my intelligence to have a conversation with you, or if you can't discuss things without it turning into a full blown fight then I'm ending it. I had one ex with whom I could be myself, have intellectually stimulating conversations, AND we could debate without it coming between us......I miss her.	As a woman who loves cooking and baking, trying new stuff, my SO has the blandest pallet and the things he will eat mean I only ever feed us the same 5 or 6 things. I've tried everything, but he won't eat any red meat apart from ground beef for some reason, cheese, milk, eggs, cream, fish, vegetables....nothing!	0
Women who weren't that keen on kids, but ended up having them, how do you feel about it now?	I identified as childfree, until I found out I was pregnant and too far along to abort. We're coming up on the year anniversary of that pregnancy test, and I have a 9 month old; do that horrifying math. Adjusting to a radical life change without being able to make any choices about it was difficult. Thankfully, I've never resented my baby. I resent the hell out of my partner, but not the baby. I love her, and she's really cool, but we got the easiest baby ever. If she had been fussy or difficult, I don't know what I would have done. Kids are a lot. We're at the point in our population development that we don't need a lot more kids, so it's not like you owe humanity your uterus. If you have a choice and don't really want children, I advise against it.	Just for the record, you don't have to have kids. Don't listen to people insisting that you must, or that your life will be pointless, or you'll die alone and all that other nonsense. We childfree people hear it all the time. It's your choice and your life. /r/childfree	1
Has there ever been something in a relationship you thought you could get over but ultimately couldn't?	Social media was a big thing for me too. He posted his every move on facebook except for when he was with me. I just left it alone because I don't post much but I commented on one of his pictures and my comment disappeared. I asked him what happened and he played dumb, so I posted something on his wall just to see what would happen and he immediately deleted it. I asked why he seemed to be so ashamed of me and he said I was trying too hard, I broke it off there. I found out later that he was in relationships with multiple women at once, it was a giant shit show.	Our age difference. I'm seven months older than my boyfriend and it really bothers me because I've always imagined myself with someone years older than me.	1
Have you ever straight up walked out in the middle of a date?	Once, years ago. The guy straight up *told me* in the middle of dinner that he only asked me out to make his ex jealous. Yeahhhh...	Yep! We went to a local bar to shoot some pool. Dude answered a phone call from his mother 15 minutes in on our first date. Not one of those "My mom is sick/a family member is sick/some other necessary quick check-in call" - this was about her wanting to give him clothes and a couch from his brother or some shit. He sat there and chatted with her for *10 minutes*. Not once did he say "Mom I gotta go, I'm on a date" or anything of the sort. Then acted like it was totally normal after hanging up. I went to the bathroom and left out the back door of the place.	1
Ladies, have you ever ended a friendship because you felt like you were doing all the "work"?	I just stop initiating and let it fade out on its own... I don't think i'd ever make a formal declaration about it, that just seems weird to me	Yes. Well, not cut off completely. But I got real tired of it. She won't talk to me about big stuff and I know she doesn't have anyone else to. I'm actually glad that she got let go from her last job, because I was scared for her. She worked with a whole bunch of men and she's the kind that likes attention, and can't distinguish boundaries. I wish she would have talked to me. I keep asking for her to hang out and ra never a good time. It's very frustrating on my end because I want to be a good friend and I have nothing but time!	1
What things have men you've dated said that has revealed a grave lack of knowledge about the female anatomy?	I wish I knew the /u/ to give her props, but the best answer I've ever seen to this question was from a woman whose boyfriend was happily jiggling her boobs around and asked in all innocence, "Won't all this milk go bad?"	Asking if giving a blowjob brings a woman pleasure... uh... seriously? Stick a banana down YOUR throat and tell me how *great* that feels!	1
All male house, roommates girlfriend is moving in with us,. How can we make her more comfortable?	Put a trashcan in the bathroom if there isn't one there already. Otherwise, basic good roommate stuff. Do your dishes, clean the stove after you cook, empty the dish drainer.	The best way to make *me* comfortable in that situation is just to act normal. If someone treated me differently than the guys in the house I'd be bummed out because it would make me feel inferior (and yes, it includes behaviors like putting me on a pedestal--different treatment is always bad).	1
Guys seem to think they are more desirable when taken because they look good when someone wants them. I think it has more to do with the more "equal" way they treat women and men in group settings. Your thoughts?	I am personally more likely to talk to a guy who is taken because I'm only looking for friends anyway. If I'm taken and he's taken, there is a much, much lower possibility of my friendliness leading to an awkward asking out thing. So, yeah, they are more desirable, but more desirable as a friend.	Men seem to be preoccupied with "value", which is a notion I find kind of creepy. Also your hunter/hunted analogy is a little convoluted, but I think I get it. That said, I'd say the desperation thing is kind if true, because guys can get very weird when they're trying to get laid. It's more comfortable to talking to someone who's taken because they're not turning every moment into "you're really gorgeous, can I get your number?" And then the fact that women are talking to him makes the man perceive that his value goes up, which makes him more confident.	1
What's something everyone else on AW seems to enjoy, but you don't?	- Feminism, and all its related activism (or lack thereof) - Casual sex/promiscuous sex/polyamory/FWB/hook ups - Receiving oral sex - most aspects of pop culture marketed towards women (music, movies, tv shows that seem to be popular with the women around here...I don't care for them) - period sex - contrived political correctness - A vociferous child free stance despite still being in your reproductive years: look I get it, I was like that too, but most people won't truly believe you until you hit menopause.	Benedict Cumberbatch. He is not attractive to me at all. I know this might seem bad, he can't help the way he looks, but his face is kind of creepy looking. It has a lot points.	0
What's something you like as an adult that teenage you would be extremely surprised by?	monoganism beer spinach olives running having a child i think i always liked dresses, just not myself in dresses because i didn't like myself,... i guess	Adult me listens to a lot more pop music than teenage me would like Also R&B. Also pop punk lol	0
Women who spray toilet seats with pee -- WHY?	In public bathroom I don't sit, I squat and pee. Sometimes it sprays on the toilet seat. Usually I wipe it with toilet paper. Sometimes I am lazy and don't do it. :/	I see this question asked somewhat regularly. You're never going to get an answer. The type of person who leaves a giant mess in a public bathroom is not the type of person who enjoys answering introspective questions.	0
What is your cause and what can I change about my daily lifestyle to further it?	Homelessness. Donate food to shelters and food banks - NOT expired packets of ranch seasoning that have been sitting in the back of your cabinet, donate things that won't just need to be thrown out by an employee or volunteer as soon as they're delivered. Volunteer with a shelter. Do it regularly. You'll learn how easy it is to become homeless and how difficult it is to get out of it. You'll meet people, and help people. You might get a free meal out of it, I work at a shelter and we always feed volunteers if there isn't a food shortage. The food is often surprisingly delicious.	Mine is animal rights and the environment. I'm a vegan and believe in speciesism. Watch Earthlings and stop consuming animal products. Stop going to zoos and aquariums. Don't buy your pets from breeders, take in rescues instead. And so forth.	1
What are some things about you that would make most Reddittors hate you?	i like to start passionate arguments and then halfway through laugh it off and say "yeah, you're probably right." and just walk away.	I'm a southern sorority girl who loves bros. I'm not a feminist, but I believe in equality - I think women (in first world countries) should go prove that they're equal by working just as hard as men do instead of complaining about their triggers behind a keyboard. I grew up with nothing, an alcoholic father, whole nine yards blah blah, put myself through school at a prestigious private university, and now I'm making a great, successful life for myself because I WORKED HARD. Sure men have discriminated against me but that's because they, individually, are dumbasses. As a whole I've found that most men respect women, and if you're around men who don't, you need to find better friends. No one was put on this planet to hand you things, if you want it, go out and take it.	1
I just bought my first leggings after realizing they really are super comfortable. I was wrong and you ladies were right. What other great trends am I missing due to my assumptions?	Trend I'm getting on board with: maxi dressed and rompers are basically pajamas, or sweatpants. So comfy, just throw them on, lie in bed and eat cheetos for an hour, look amazing. You heard it right here folks.	You were definitely missing out with leggings! They are so great. I don't know about other trends you're missing out on but one thing's for certain: don't try high-waisted shorts! They make your ass look like a pancake :(	1
What is the worst haircut you've ever got?	Similar thing. Was growing my hair long from a pixie. Hair dresser ruined my gorgeous long hair... it was just awful. So I chopped it all off again.	Already awkward and ugly 12 year old me let my aunt cut my bangs. I looked like Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber all summer. Thanks Aunt Rosie!	0
I've heard a lot about Nice GuysTM but are there NiceGirlsTM? If so, how do I spot them? Do you any of you ladies know any?	I used to be one. I thought, "hey, I'm funny, I try to be nice, I shower daily, WHY DON'T BOYS LIKE ME?" Well, because I was clingy and annoying. I was also socially awkward and didn't understand the basics of how relationships and interactions with the opposite sex worked. I wanted a relationship for the sole purpose of being a relationship, not for any other reason. It took some time and soul searching, but I'd like to hope I grew out of it. It was mostly in my late high school/early college years that I was one.	They frequent tumblr. They have 50s style hair and cat eye glasses. They're morbidly obese or at least have a huuuuuge overhanging gut. Her arms look like ham shanks on sticks. They will have hair that isn't a natural color (blue and pink are favorites). She will settle for no less than a >6ft Adonis executive with chiseled abs you could grate cheese on. She "isn't worth anything less." But he can't be a chubby chaser, because that's insulting. She will wear extremely unflattering clothes "as a statement". Her armpit hair is so long it has cowlicks. She will call those girls who take care of themselves and have confidence "skinny bitches". "Thin privilege" is a common appellation. She is not looking for a "nice guy". She is the "RealWomanTM". Because "guys can't handle a Real Woman, they always go for skinny bitches."	1
What are hobbies/interests you love, but you dislike the associated community?	I love League of Legends but their community is trash. I've never had to deal with anything because I'm a woman, but just everyone being shitty to everyone all the time. I love going to the gym and lifting weights. What I hate, especially on Reddit, is the whole "You just gotta be lifting bro!" attitude. "I have clinical depression" "Lift bro, that'll clear it right up!" "I'm having trouble grasping the author's meaning in this passage of Atlas Shrugged." "Bro, lift, seriously. I used to read Curious George then I started lifting now I read The Phenomenology of the Spirit for fun."	* **veganism/animal rights** I will leave it at that as redditers attack them all of the time so that they don't have to consider their message * **Programming/IT** I've met some incredible people. It is usually 50/50 from either meeting an exceptionally cool person or meeting a socially awkward, angry, exceptionally difficult person. Enough said, most of the "door number 2" types show up on reddit and are justifiably, routinely, criticized. * **Atheists** At least the contemporary internet atheist community. Neckbeard city, pretentious, emotionally stunted, gratitiously offensive. The arguments for supernatural beings are laughably easy to pull apart yet all of these guys walk around with their chests puffed out like they just figured out the mysteries of the universe. That last part goes for "skeptics" too. They get too much pride from the intellectual equivalent of fishing in a barrel.	1
What's the most improbable scenario in which you've taken a "can't be too sure" pregnancy test?	I had a tubal ligation and was not having sex. My period was late by about 12 or so hours (super rare for me, less than 6 or so times in my life has this happened) and I FREAKED! I wouldn't let myself take a pregnancy test- because of no sex and refusal to believe that I'm Virgin Mary 2.0, it just seemed crazy to give into that paranoia.... But those were terrifying hours before my period came.	I was about 19 and had started dating my current partner. It should be noted that we took things extremely slow, and had not yet had sex. Anyway, I felt super queasy and my period was late by a few days (which is not uncommon). I worked myself into a tizzy, thinking that I must have come in contact with my roommate's jizz in the bathroom or something, and that I was going to have to explain to my new boyfriend that not only was I pregnant, but it was my roommate's baby. Yeah, it was the beginning of the stomach flu, and I'm an idiot. My period came while I was riding home from the store where I bought the pregnancy test. Seriously, who thinks that sperm is just floating around in the bathroom, waiting to infect you with zygotes. Ugh.	0
What is the one thing that bothered you throughout your 20s and no more now?	Being a virgin into my late 20s. Now, as a virgin in his 30s, I kinda wish I were a late 20s virgin again.	I was generally just way more self-conscious in my early 20s. I'd always feel like I was being watched, or like I had to impress everyone I interacted with, or like everyone was judging me. I finally realized that literally no one cares. I don't remember what the stranger I bumped into at the grocery store last Tuesday looks like, and they almost definitely don't remember me either. Life is a whole lot easier now that I don't feel embarrassed and self-conscious all the time.	0
What do you wish you'd been told before puberty?	This isn't strictly puberty related, but tell her she's beautiful frequently. She will roll her eyes and disbelieve you but she needs to hear it from someone to help built her self esteem. Compliment her on everything--how smart she is, how hard she works, how creative she is, etc.	Go to the book store and buy "the care and keeping of you." It will tell her a lot. You will need to tell her about birth control though.	0
Ladies of Reddit, how do you deal with depression?	I hit the bar and return home with the tallest, most buffed guy I can find. Works charms for selfsteem. God, men are easy	I was lucky enough to find someone who accepts me completely and encouraged me to go to therapy. He was also the one to clarify that I'm not crazy, playing the victim or just stupid.	0
When women are "freshening up" before sex, are you wiping your butts?	I usually grab a clean *soft* wash cloth and then wash the vulva. Since I'm already there, I give the ass a quick wipe too. That way, if oral's on the table, I know it'll be a good time. (I don't use soap because it's not good for the vulva, and isn't needed for cleanness.) If I don't have a wash cloth for some reason, I kneel in the bath tub, turn on the faucet, and wash with my hands. After I'm done, my partner washes up too. We both love oral, but neither is a fan of smegma, so this quick routine is good.	Yes. And vulva, and making sure there isn't lint and my hair/skin won't taste/smell like urine. It's a quick wash. I haven't yet found signs I'd improperly wiped, but I frequently have lint in my crack. Also peeing, because getting anything besides an empty bladder pounded on is really uncomfortable for me.	0
Any other butch straight girls out there? Does it affect your interaction with guys?	I don't know if I'd call myself "butch" but I'm not girly. I think your mom is correct, most men prefer feminine girls. I don't want to have to change everything about myself to find a bf.	I'm pretty "butch" I guess. Short military style haircut, I'm *IN* the military, and I'm assertive and sometimes loud. (I'm hard of hearing, so I don't always know my volume.) I've been married for a long time to a wonderful guy who is soooo used to me being hit on by women. Everytime I transfer to a new duty station, it takes about three days of sideeye before someone asks me outright if I'm gay. I usually tell them to fuck off - which admittedly doesn't help much. But there are plenty of guys who like me for ME. Good partners don't want someone who isn't themselves, they want you for **you**, whatever that is. Those people are out there, I promise.	0
What is the cringiest way you've ever shown interest in someone you wanted to date, that still makes you want to crawl away and die of shame?	Asked for their facebook immediately after the date. Apparently that is creepy because that is too personal. I'm a man and for all she knows I might come to her house and kill her. Women have to deal with creepy dudes all the time so I understand why they might be scared.	Well, here it goes -- I once waited right beside the stir-fry section of our dining hall trying to work up the courage to ask out a guy who worked in the dining hall. I was there for like two hours and I *finally* worked up the courage to ask him out on a date. It turns out that he had absolutely no idea who I was and we had a class together the previous semester that was capped at 15 students. Oh god.	0
Do any of you ladies feel miserable the week before your period?	Not an answer, but I remember I once asked an ex of mine a while back: > Wait... does PMS stand for Premenstrual or Postmenstrual Syndrom? Her answer? > Yes.	I feel like I wanna hump everything. The days leading up to the start of my period is usually when I masturbate the most. How does this effect my SO? Well when I have a SO its usually the best week of his month because I wont leave his dick alone.	0
What seemingly small or insignificant things have you come to realize are important to you in a relationship?	The smallest of the small: Not using the term 'LOL', except sarcastically. To expand on it, I really love it when someone's a bigger nerd about using proper English than I am. My last SO used the term 'one', and it really did something for me. I've always wished that I had the confidence to do that.	LATENESS. This makes me so mad. It's super disrespectful. If I'm waiting for you and we made plans, and I took the time to get ready and be there for you when we agreed to meet, you can do the decency of doing the same.	0
What justice was served to one of your exes that you didn't intentionally serve yourself?	early 2000s ex wife cheated on me and ended up leaving me for him. Well about 8 months later she breaks up with new guy and he is upset about it. So he plasters her naked pictures all over the internet and makes sure that her name is on it for everyone to see.	She never officially broke up with me, started dating another person, and acted completely cold and distant when we finally talked it out. She got an ugly haircut and looks like shit. Petty? Oh Yeah. But now *I'm the cute one*.	0
Do any other women here become an awkward penguin when trying to talk to other women?	In my head: oh my gosh this woman is JUST like me, were gonna be best friends! What I say: I like your shirt! Her: thanks *silence*	I can totally relate to this! I have more guys friends than girls and feel a greater sense of ease when communicating with men on a friendship level than women. I just find men more easy going and funnier than women. As well my mom is my best friend and my go to for shopping, dining out and movies (other than my SO). And yes I also feel awkward around a lot of women when conversing or getting to know them as there seems to be a greater sense of competition and manipulation between female friendships. However, I think quality or quantity is the thing to look for with female friendships. If you meet the right woman or women you will feel more at ease. They are out there just need to find them--usually a few glasses of wine helps me ;) Good luck!	1
Hey on account of Freud's birthday, do you think there is any similarity between your SO and your father?	They both own the same awful looking "white people tourist hiker" hat to keep the sun off your head and neck while still being lightweight and breathable.	Okay bare with me I'm in an open relationship. My husband is the opposite of my father. He is naturally submissive, very thoughtful, a helper, and likes to spend lots of quality time together. My boyfriend is just like my father. I have a lot of fun with him, he is logical like me (i take after my father), he is frugal, a problem solver, he is charming and a natural leader. I joke that he and I would take over the world in 1 week's time. I get to see both sides of the coin. I really love and adore the qualities my boyfriend has I think my husband compliments me in different ways. I understand why I am attracted to the qualities my boyfriend has but I also understand why my husband is a great match for me.	1
Inspired by shoes-in-the-house thread: What's a norm that you didn't realize was specific to your culture until someone brought it up?	Bringing a small gift when you first visit, guest right, kissing on the cheek as a hello, offering coffee to anyone who comes in (even the mailman), not talking to strangers, smiling is reserved for friends... A lot of things How Americans treat everyone else as crazy in this thread is fucking annoying. If you're the only people in the world to harass strangers on the street, maybe you are the crazy ones?	Until I grew up and left my mother's house and joined the Navy, I was unaware most people ate so much store bought food. We had a ranch and many animals ranging from 50 some odd head of cattle, 15 pigs, 30 or 40 turkeys, and 50 or so chickens. We regularly traded meat for vegetables from various neighbors and visited the grocery store for special things like bread and pizza and peanut butter. I mean, we had 200 or so acres, what else were we supposed to do with it other than raise animals? Everyone has some chunk of land, too, right? Probably between 50 and 150 acres? No? Just us and our little area?	0
Ladies, what are some typical problems you experience that men dont have/will understand?	When you put in a panty liner but it didn't stick to your underwear properly and ends up rolling back and sticking to your pubes instead. And then it tears a little every time you move. OW.	Shout out to all the dudes in this thread trying to argue the validity (or lack there of) all the problems being mentioned. Way to keep the stereotype alive, *gentlesirs!*	1
Oh God, I'm rewatching Sex &amp; the City and I hate them all. What shows, movies, books etc disappointed you the second time around?	Firefly. I mean, the "Chinese" was pretty bad on first watch, but then everything that's fundamentally not right with the series (basically no Asians, the poor treatment of Inara and "whores") is really apparent.	When I was packing away my childhood books for my move a few years back, I decided to re-read some of the big series titles that I'd collected. *The Baby-Sitters Club* and *The Boxcar Children* - I couldn't even get through them with a straight face because who the heck has such freakishly well behaved and trustworthy kids? *The Animorphs*, on the other hand, held up fairly well. I actually appreciated the story more as an adult than when I was younger. Even if the actual writing style is super simple, it touches on a lot of difficult and complex issues and doesn't glorify the whole getting super powers to fight a war thing.	0
How many of you actually hate Mother's Day?	It bothers me how entitled moms become over Mother's Day. Ugh. Just chill out. I get it, you work hard, but come on.	i lost my first and only child almost 2 years ago. mother's day sucks. i will hate tomorrow, but i will still celebrate my mom	0
Ladies, does your butt hole get itchy?	All the time!!!! Edit: I decided to google it and apparently it's because I use wet wipes every time I go #2 to try and prevent the frequent UTIs I used to have. The chemicals in the wipes can dry you out and cause itching. The more you know... Edit 2: My first top comment on a thread is about my butt hole. Would you look at that.	Yes. I take toilet paper from work and it's pretty rough, plus i often poop more than once in a morning, depending on if coffee was had or if I'm eating tons more veggies than usual. If i don't cleanse my cornhole with some kind of moistened towelette before going out it will almost undoubtedly get real itchy. I should probably just buy toilet paper, it's not worth it anymore, having to put up with all this cornhole business.	1
Is your current SO the best sex you've ever had? If not is it ever awkward in your relationship?	Yep. He wasn't, at first. But he's also the first guy that I've felt comfortable being completely honest with what I enjoy, and his needs are compatible with mine. I'm never ashamed to share something new I'd like to try, and if it doesn't work for us, we just move on. It's amazing.	No, and no. I figure that life is too short to settle for amazing sex and a lousy relationship -- my priorities are apparently different than yours.	1
Ladies, what do you donate to?	I can't give money, so I give my blood. ETA If I ever were to live in the states again and able to donate, I'd give actual GOOD food to pantries. So many heartbreaking stories of kids having to choke down disgusting canned meat products on Thanksgiving. If you wouldn't eat it, be kind and don't make it someone's only choice.	Nothing, because I know that charities will just use most of the money for themselves and then use maybe about 5% of the money for the actual cause.	1
Not meaning to offend here, but do you sometimes feel that people on Reddit can be quite snobby when it comes down to where you are in life?	This is not unique to Reddit. People in general are judgmental as fuck. I have my life decisions questioned all the time despite having a good job (pays above average for my age), hobbies I enjoy, physically active/fit etc... I'm a happy, pleasant person, but not living by some other person's standards makes them treat me as some kind of failure.	Honestly, Reddit tends to be a judgy as fuck place in general, and I don't think a lot of the popular opinions/circlejerks on this site are very representative of how most people think/behave in real life. I wouldn't take it too personally. If you're content and living well by your own standards, fuck everyone else.	0
Do you think "life skills" should be taught in schools? If so what should that include?	Absolutely. I think personal finance would probably be the most beneficial; it is appalling how many of my friends have no idea how to manage their money.	I think bringing social etiquette would be a great idea. Proper table manners, how to introduce someone and be introduced, how to make polite conversation, how to make your interest formally known, and how to politely decline someone's formally expressed interest. I think these skills have been lost and, while I'm not looking to return society to some kind of Victorian ideal, you can see a common theme on Reddit where people basically don't know how to act in these specific ways, and they end up being socially awkward and clueless how to fix it. People used to literally take classes for these things! Maybe bringing it back in a certain extent would be a non-terrible idea.	1
My girlfriend gets tons of facebook messages from guys asking her to do porn or give them sexual favors. Is this normal?	Bruh you need to do some digging in your S/Os history. having your girl get messages like that implies that she's putting something out there in the world that makes the guys think that she would actually accept the offer.	I have my privacy settings on facebook set to only accept messages from people who are on my friends list, and I choose who I "friend" carefully on purpose. If your girlfriend has an exorbitant amount of facebook friends and accepts anyone who send her a request, she's probably going to end up with those kinds of messages. Yeah, they happen, and they're gross, and you don't even have to look like a pornstar. Internet targeting of women is real, and it's everywhere, which is why we need to put up defenses to block those messages before they get sent.	0
Found out today I will have to go through IVF to get pregnant. Pretty upset... Any positive IVF/adoption/surrogacy related stories that would cheer me up??	I am adopted! My parents told me as far back as I can remember - we had books about "the night we got to pick you up from the hospital," and that stuff. I also am lucky enough to have a close relationship with my birthmom - it's fun to compare our similarities and share our lives, BUT she is not my mom in any sense other that biologically. I truly feel like I won the parent lotto because my parents welcomed my birth family into their lives when I was 12 and we spend holidays together, etc. That's my one big piece of advice - always tell your kid that they are adopted and they are lucky because their birth mother loved them so much she found a family who could care for them.	I know I'm a product of it as my parents had me later in their years. (34) It works, but yes it can be an arduous task hearing about it from others. It's still odd that this isn't spoken about more often. While birth control is so often discussed among other topics related to sexual/women's health. (The whole FYI it will be much harder to conceive after 30/32/35 For some women they hit the first "dip" as early as 28.)	1
Pretty women, do you ever feel like it's harder to make other girl friends or be accepted by other women?	Honestly- I'll give you a viewpoint from a relatively average-looking woman. I am intimidated by more beautiful women for sure. I do think this comes partially out of jealousy but mostly comfort. If I'm looking to connect with someone in the workplace, or some social event, I will usually migrate towards women who are less attractive. Out of a large pool of people, it's most likely that the prettier ones already have friends, or a boyfriend, or will be somehow approached easily and if I'm around I'll get discarded. Of course that's definitely not true but it's wired in my brain. One of my biggest fears is being in a group talking and slowly being edged out of the conversation. With ugly girls I feel more secure that won't happen and can let my guard down.	Stop trying to befriend them. They don't want to be your friend. And you don't want to be their friend. They are coworkers, they don't care. Who cares about them, they will never want the best for you or stick up for you, and they will always undermine you and if you give them any info they will try to twist it up and make you loose your job. This is my experience and it happens on the dot every single time.	1
How many of you lovely ladies really don't have much dating experience at all?	Your friendship group may be odd. While I'm on my third serious relationship, a lot of my friends are on okcupid, tinder, hinge, etc. We're all in our early to mid-twenties. I've never used any of those sites because I prefer meeting people in real life, but most of my friends are going on a bunch of unsuccessful dates or meeting a guy, dating for less than a month, and then having it fizzle out.	I'm 22, and I've never been on a date, never been kissed, and never have had a SO. It's not that I'm not interested. I just wanted to focus more on school. If it happens, it happens. I'll be going to grad school in a year or two, so anytime from now on is when I'm okay with it.	0
How many of you have trouble gauging how attractive you are, or whether or not you're attractive at all?	Sometimes, I'm like "DAMN. Go put on some make-up, or, better yet, hide all day inside." Then sometimes, I'm like "DAY-UM! You should be a model!" It varies by day/ cycle/ sleep/ hydration/ attitude/ productivity/ exercise. I don't know if other people can see the subtle changes, but I feel like my attractiveness changes. A lot. I have different outfits/ makeup routines/ methods for dealing with them, which helps	I know I'm not considered attractive because I'm overweight, and everyone knows fat women are the worst thing in the world /s I actually have no idea about my face. I can look at my face in the mirror and think "I look great" and "I look fucking weird" in the same minute and not know the truth.	1
What's the most seemingly unrelated thing over which you have ever lost your attraction to someone?	He laughed like a hyena during movies in a theatre and would repeat the funny lines in the loudest voice ever. Example: Actor in movie: "you smell like dirty laundry, wash yo' self" Ex SO: "HAHAHAHAAH, YOU SMELL LIKE DIRTY LAUNDRY, WASH YO' SELF!!!!!!!" So embarrassing.	Seriously these are really crummy things to lose attraction for. All of these things could be talked about and resolved so that your relationship could move on. Its really stupid to take these things seriously when the possibility of love is real. Feel free to downvote me.	1
What ended up being a deal breaker in your relationship that you didn't think would bother you at the start?	Having a cat. I am very allergic, and don't like them. I thought I could deal, it was his pet. Total nightmare. That cat was the root of so many problems.	His critical nature. I didn't think anything of it at first, because it was always directed at other things (movies, other people's houses, books, etc.). But then, when I became the target .... wow, that was not ok.	0
What interest/hobby do you enjoy that you don't tell people about? Why do you keep it secret or choose not to talk about it much?	I like sitting and colouring. I don't tell many people because a lot assume it's really childish and that I'm weird, but I find it really soothing and it helps me when I'm stressed.	Another on for me is feminism. I don't like being randomly attacked by rabid MRAs for "hating men" when I've probably done more for men's rights than most of them. I don't enjoy guys suddenly "devils advocating" on dating sites or Facebook or whatever because being a feminist means "come question me with ridiculous straw man situations because I believe in equality". So yeah, I just tend to not mention it unless I know someone has a reasonable view of feminism (is a feminist or at least has a somewhat nuanced understanding of feminism but disagrees with parts of it, or even knows nothing about feminism but is curious about it).	1
What aspects of being in a relationship do you suck at?	Showing and being honest with my emotions--whether that's showing that something he did hurt me or that I feel strongly about him. My husband is the only man who's ever really known how I felt, and known that he can hurt me and that he's extremely, ridiculously loved by me. I tend to pretend that people can't hurt me because I'm just not that invested, but I'm actually quite sensitive--I just hide my feelings from the rest of the world. It feels both scary and amazing to trust this one person with my vulnerabilities.	I focus on making my partner happy and forget about making sure I'm happy too. I am also far too forgiving and apologize even when I'm not wrong just to resolve conflict.	0
Do you have any physical insecurities/flaws that have changed the way you behave or live your life?	i used to avoid eye contact with people because i was worried they'd look at me and think me unattractive, and used to walk with my head down, too, but i'm trying to break out of those habits.	I mean, obvious answer but I only ever shave because I naturally have hair that I don't want to have.	1
How have you failed at being an adult lately?	I stayed up until 5 last night playing League of Legends and slept in until 3 in the afternoon. It reminds me of my teenage years.	I did my laundry at my parents' house last Thursday night. All of my t-shirts are still on the living room floor, waiting to be put on hangers so they can be hung in my closet. I keep looking at them, and I know it'll only take like 15 minutes, but I just really don't feel like it.	0
If you have a bachelor's degree or higher: what did you major in and what do you do for a living right now?	I have a BA in English and am working on an MS in Project Management. I'm a technical writer for a military contractor. I write about tanks, basically. PEW PEW MURICA.	BS in hospitality management from an average school. Graduated December 2012. Marketing Manager in the finance industry making $60k now.	1
Does anyone else disagree with this: "I don't tell him I have a boyfriend because he should respect my 'no' more than another man's ownership of me." ?	The "NO" isn't about respecting another man. It's fear of the unknown. The guy isn't respecting your boyfriend by backing off. He's playing it safe. He doesn't know your boyfriend. Your boyfriend could be a 6ft 4in MMA fighter for all he knows. If the guy thought he could kick your boyfriends ass, he'd still try. But yes, your NO should be enough. Grown women shouldn't be playing hard to get anyway.	I think the real argument is that if a guys starts making unwanted advances, saying "I'm not interested" should be enough. We shouldn't have to make up fake boyfriends for the guy to accept our "no".	0
Ladies, what's your favourite book that you feel like nobody else has read?	I have to admit, it's hard not to make a couple snarky comments when people are posting about literal best sellers and required reading in schools as "books you feel like nobody else has read" I adore the Bartimaeus trilogy by Jonathan Stroud, it's like if the Harry Potter world was way more realistic and wizards were shitheads. It's also hilarious. I know it was also a YA best seller but among fans of fantasy and YA I have never run into else who read it, so....I'm snarking myself here, I guess. But seriously, read those goddamn books, people. Even my fantasy-hating husband loved them.	Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. It seems like everyone should read that but I've only met 3 or 4 IRL who have. Everyone and their mother read 1984 but Huxley's dystopian future is so much more frighteningly realistic.	1
What are your gym annoyances/pet peeves?	When the machine I'm using starts making really loud squeaky noises. Most people have headphones in, but occasionally someone doesn't, and then I feel bad :(	Not gym, but I've recently taken up just jogging around my neighborhood early in the morning. I do this specifically because I want to greatly minimize the chance that someone will actually see me running. So my greatest annoyance is running into the guy who just HAS to walk his dogs at 5:30 in the morning. Not to sound arrogant but I can't help but feel like he's watching my ass as I jog past. Ugh.	1
What's the single most romantic gesture you've ever received?	Just the most recent of late, I have a mad crush on the hottest man, I am a major baseball freak in a text I asked him if he wanted to come up to see a tier 2 world series ring from a friend, not knowing If he even liked baseball, well he said no thanks, it was his favorite teams arch rival, so he says no thanks a dodger and Yankee fan. Just melted my heart, lame I know...	I didn't get to go to my senior prom because I was performing in a show that night at the community theater. I was 18 and he was 20. We had fallen for each other quickly and during the beginning of summer, we had this sort of crazy infatuation with each other. We'd only been seeing each other a few weeks when this happened, it was the night of one of my shows performances and the night of my prom. He picks me up after the show and drives me out to this empty road, pulls the car over and turns on the song from The Notebook that Noah and Ally danced to in the middle of he street and said "I know I can't take you to your prom but can I have this dance?" And we danced in the middle of the empty street and it was perfect.	0
My SO wouldn't buy a virtual pet chicken in a game we play together. What things have your SO/family member/friends "done", to make you irrationally sad?	My mom asks for a peanut butter sandwich when she comes over. I'm allergic. I have no peanut butter in my house. She gets pouty. So not only is she trying to kill me, but I've managed to disappoint her in the process. Edit: Folks, I'm not denying my mother food, I buy countless specialty items and bake for days just for her. She consumes everything then asks for PBJ and pouts. No, I'm not willing keeping an item in my house that can so easily kill me, sealed or not (I have sticky fingered children). I have almond/cashew butter (which she poo-poos).	I get sad when my boyfriend doesnt wanna make out a little when we are both brushing our teeth. I get why he doesnt like it, but getting sloppily minty together is so fun!	1
I woke up to find my roommate's menstrual blood all over our toilet. Ladies, what are your roommate horror stories?	My ex roommate developed a brain tumor that caused him to slip into dream like states while being awake. This caused him to freak out, take off his clothes, grab kitchen knives, run in and out of the house, break things, and he did this every day. Cops were called often. Then he became utterly irrational. Like a cabinet door being left open caused him to toss all my belongings into the garage, breaking valuables, and smashing the front bumper of my car. He was crazy, and honestly, I think if the brain tumor kills him, it will be a good thing.	My flatmate has been ignoring me, and apparently it's my fault because when i sit next to her in lectures I quietly say 'hi' (instead of what? organising a mariachi band to play on her arrival?), then last week had guests sleeping on our kitchen/living room floor, who left because I told them to stop fucking in my kitchen as my bedroom is right next to it. Then the next night she had friends over until 2am, where she apologised for me being 'so rude' for telling these people to stop fucking, and telling everyone how she'd 'tried' to be nice to me but I have 'no empathy'. Y'know, while I was in my bedroom, able to hear everything...	0
I just found out my neighbour throws his dead leaves over the fence in to my garden. In what ways do your neighbours suck?	My upstairs neighbor came down to complain about our bathroom fan being to loud. He blasts EDM music every night and let's his trash from his balcony fall into our back porch. Haven't said a word to him about it until then. I was like "You aren't serious".	The neighbors right across the street from us had all their stucco sandblasted off today and it was horrifically loud. It physically hurt to be outside and I had to help my sister unpack her car which took like 20 or so minutes going in and out of the house.	1
DAE worry about longterm birth control use and its affect on your brain, body, cycle and relationships?	I do wish there was more long term research available about how BC effects the body in the long run but I don't think/worry about it much because I don't really have a choice but to use it.	Yep! One of many reasons I refuse to be on HBC. Taking a pill that externally regulates an entire system of the body to me, healthwise and just in a philisophical sense, is not a good thing and likely far more harmful than we realize. I also really like knowing my natural cycle - it's empowering to me to know that what my body does is, like, it's own thing, and not caused by a pill	1
Women in STEM- what are your personal experiences with the gender dynamics in your field?	I'm an accountant. My experience has been really positive. I've not really run into any sexism or other negative gender issues. I work with mostly men and a few women - neither of which cause any problems related to gender. Maybe we're just boring enough that it personalities don't clash? IDK, but all through business school and in my career it was fine. I also have a B.S. in Math and Economics. Same deal - predominantly men, no examples of sexism or anything - the overwhelming majority of my experience has been positive. Not sure how common others experience negative gender experiences or the underlying causes, but, IME, that was not the case	Mechanical engineer here, the gender ratio in my undergrad class was 10%. Overall, it was pretty good, except for the one technician who assumed that I wasn't actually working on an assignment with my teammates in the workshop, but instead, 'had just come along with my boyfriend.' Cheers. That's **definitely** why I'm wearing steelcaps....	0
I've noticed women act differently when I tell them my real name. What are your thoughts on men with feminine names?	If you were Korean or something, I wouldn't even think twice about it. But I can't say I've ever heard that name used for men in other nationalities besides Asian. Otherwise, it might strike me as odd for a split second and then I would proceed to give no craps. I've known dudes named "Shannon" and I find that a lot more feminine than Kim.	My partner and I both have unisex names that are frequently mistaken for belonging to the opposite gender. Confusion abounds, and it is beautiful.	0
What's the most egregious misunderstanding of the female body you've ever encountered?	White discharge stain in underwear = other men's semen Or that fucking 100 guys once will make your vagina loose, but fucking the same guy 100 times won't.	A female friend thought the Pill worked by basically clogging up all the period blood in your uterus. She said "Isn't it dirty?". She also said a doctor told her that...	1
What little things make your SO 10x more attractive to you?	-When we're meeting up for the first time that day, he says hello by picking me up and kissing me. -He's brings out the best in everyone. I swear, each person he talks to walks away with a smile. -He's passionate about the environment, and reduces waste as much as he can, even if it's awkward. Example, a store was giving out samples of some drink. He asked them to pour two samples into his nalgene so we wouldn't waste two sample cups. -He sits next to me, instead of across from me. -He never doubts my abilities. He never looks at something and says, "I don't think you can do that." Instead, he tells me to go for it, and if I fail, he encourages me to try again.	It's the way he looks at me. He gets this look on his face and I just know he's stupid in love with me.	0
How to let a man know you're interested in him romantically/sexually without mentioning appearance?	By just plain asking him on a date. As far as appearance, he can see you - nothing you say is going to substantially disguise how you look or change how he feels about it. So just ask him out and let him decide.	As a male, and if it were me, laugh at my jokes, casually bump into me, then if I'm interested, when I try to advance into your personal space, let me.	1
Women who have been in emotionally but not physically abusive relationships, are you able to talk about it? When did you realize it was abuse?	I didn't figure it out until it crossed the line into physical abuse. It took a year or two to really talk about it and understand how horrid emotional abuse is versus physical abuse. Broken bones heal, broken psyches don't ever go back to normal. Unfortunately he now uses the same abusive tactics with our daughter and I'm at a loss on how to protect her and I from him. The courts basically say that unless she gets a concussion or other reportable physical injury he can do whatever he wants.	Really, I didn't realize until I was out of the relationship. While in it ... I just realized I couldn't take it anymore. I even absolve him of intent to abuse -- he was just a critical, negative person. But when I said "that hurts me" and his consistent response was "it shouldn't hurt -- you're too sensitive -- get over it" or "that's what you get", then ... that was a problem.	0
What is currently the hottest, most juiciest gossip you've heard recently that concerns someone within your social circle or people you used to know?	There was a rumor that went around at my school that a freshman was pregnant. I don't know if it was true or not.	My roommate and her boyfriend are currently having a spat. Roommate found out that her boyfriend kissed *her* friend about 6 months ago, boyfriend found out roommate kissed and spooned *his* friend (while the three of them shared a bed together). College.	0
Non-caucasian women: When you think of your life as it is today, which would you say you experience more - sexism or racism?	I definitely experience more sexism than racism, and I think there are two reasons. 1. I'm Native American, but people can never guess "what" I am so even in the unlikely event someone were racist toward me it probably wouldn't hit the mark 2. Sexism is still so ingrained in daily culture whereas racism is just so taboo nowadays that more people are actively avoiding being seen as racist. In other words, everyone is much more aware of racism than they are of sexism so they're correcting more for the former than the latter (yet anyway, there's hope for the future)	So a Caucasian women can't experience racism? As many has said it is often a combination. That I'm slutty because of my colour. With many from within certain cultures a Caucasian is worth less because of "low morals" which really just ebbs up in their view of sex. Wherever there is diversity a Caucasian is more likely to be raped. Just the fact that you excluded Caucasians from this post is racist. Especially the modern extension of racism which is one person being treated a certain way only based on the ethnic background of that person.	1
Do women use reddit to look at men?	I subscribed to r/massivecock for a while, but then unsubscribed because I sometimes go on reddit when the kid's around. Not sure how much of a representative sample I am, though.	In a sense, I do. I'm subbed to /r/Ladybonersgonecuddly and /r/LadyBoners so I guess look at dudes when they come up on my front page. And sometimes I browse porny subs that have dudes in them. But that's not the primary reason I use Reddit. It's more incidental.	0
What's the most insensitive thing you asked an adult as a kid?	My daughter is amazing at saying awkward stuff. She's five. Just last week I was picking her up from school. She has been asking a ton of questions about the equality movement ever since they studied Martin Luther King Jr. Her best friend is also the only black kid in the entire school. So a week ago, she hugged her friend goodbye and as we walked away, we passed her friend's mom making her way towards the school pushing a stroller with her friend's baby brother in it. My daughter turned to me and loudly said "BLACK PEOPLE HAVE BLACK BABIES!" Nice...	Thank god I just asked my parents, but when I was about five my cat got neutered and I asked them why our neighbors (6 or 7 kids) couldn't do the same thing.	0
I love watching Cameron Diaz shop for groceries while drinking wine in The Holiday. What insignificant movie scene is your favorite?	The "I'll show you how valuable Elle Woods can be" montage scene from Legally Blonde. Nothing can get me as pumped and ready to kick ass on an exam/paper as that one scene.	In Annie Hall, when Woody and Diane Keaton are sitting in a park in NYC and he's making up hilarious imaginary lives for the people who are walking past them.	1
"What is wrong?" "Nothing." Where does this stereotype come from?	It comes from reality. I've had this exact conversation with almost every single woman I have dated. Now, what are the root causes? As some have mentioned, it may stem from the idea that women are too emotional and should stop being that way. Another explanation is that they are looking to avoid confrontation. Another explanation is that the woman has not completely formulated what she wants to say, so this is a stalling mechanism. In my experience, this has usually been the case.	I say it when I don't think I'm justified in feeling a certain way. I'm afraid of making mountains out of molehills and starting something that doesn't need to be started. It's physically difficult for me to say anything when I feel like that. Like I want to say it, but my mouth won't move. But then my boyfriend will say something like, "I like to think I can tell you anything. And I want you to feel the same." And then I eventually open up.	0
Females of the military, how bad was/is the sexual harassment/discrimination you had or are facing?	My friend has a wife that is in the reserve. Whenever she gets back from drill, for the next month or so she gets constant Facebook messages and texts from dudes saying shit like "yeah I know you have a husband, I don't care", "come on, let's just fuck, I won't say shit", and "baby there is no way your husband will find out, I know you want it" Oh yeah, of course, constant dick pics and body shots. On one hand, it's sickening, on the other hand. She's kinda trashy. I think she welcomes it and enjoys showing her husband to make him jealous... Still though...	Pretty rampant. On the mild end of it, things like being asked who's dick I sucked to make rank so fast was pretty common. Bets going around to see who could fuck one of the new arrivals first, shit like that. I didn't realize how bad it really was, though, until I hit the higher ranks and had junior sailors coming up to me wondering if they should report being raped, assaulted, or harassed. Most never report. Then there's the problem with women regretting sleeping with someone, or using rape charges to get back at exes or one night stands that didn't pan out. The whole thing is a fucking mess.	0
What were some yellow flags about your boyfriend that turned out not to be a big deal?	I'm pursuing a career in academia, and my SO only finished one semester of college before he dropped out. At first, I worried that I wouldn't be able to connect to him on a intellectual level, but turns out he's really smart and is constantly educating himself through reading, watching documentaries, etc. Knowing him has made me much more conscious of the ways we as a society put people in certain boxes, and I'm trying to be better about it. Don't judge a book by its cover!	My boyfriend is from a very small town in the Midwest, which was a bit foreign to me since I'm from a big city on the West coast. But he and his family are actually very worldly and well educated and I was concerned for nothing.	1
Anyone else extremely uncomfortable how so many people are acting because they can't harass fat people on reddit anymore?	something about it strikes me as really...sad. like i just imagine these flabby, skinnyfat weirdos sitting in front of their computer typing away about being mad that they can't talk shit about fat people on the internet. the level of involvement they have in just talking shit about fat people seems really weird. and sad. and puzzling like, who are these people. what are their stories	I do not understand how people aren't clear that the issue with the bannings is not that the banned subs expressed abhorrent opinions (although they do), but that as a practice they supported or condoned harassment of other users. *That* is the problem. If you want to hate on fat people in your own sub without brigading or stealing users' images to mock, you're a shit person and your life is a joke, but whatever. It's the harassment that's the problem. Also, the concept of "free speech" relates to the relationship between citizen and state, not internet rando and social media site.	0
Have you ever found out someone's impression of you was completely off?	One of my friends told me that she avoided talking to me for a long time because she thought I was too cool. I have literally never in my life been too cool for anything but school.	When I was at a bar with my then-future-roommate she asked if I was interested in anybody. I happened to be into someone that she knew so I told her who. She then said "Aww, she's really nice, but I don't think she's the kind of girl who sleeps around." Absolutely blew my mind that she thought I was some kind of player. I can be very friendly and open with guys and girls I'm not interested in, but once I am with a girl that I am interested in I get very shy. I wonder if other people think I'm super successful with women and if that influences what they think of me...	1
Women with IUDs: yay or nay?	I have mirena. My sex drive went way up, my periods are usually light, and for the most part I can't even tell it's there. However, it caused me to break out around my chin (never had problems with acne while not on birth control or on the pill). I occasionally get pretty bad cramps that seem to come out of nowhere. It probably needs adjusted. And doggy style feels like he's falcon punching my uterus, usually.	Skyla checking in! Was on oral contraception for a few years about 4 years ago. Was without since. Tried Nuvaring on doctors rec and it was the worst month ever! Went with Skyla iud once the issues were treated, and I've had it for a few months. The insertion was very uncomfortable but not painful or scary. The cramps were quite bad here and there for 2 days. Spotting pretty consistent but getting better. Period lighter and easier, diminished pms symptoms which is good. And I'm losing weight, have great skin, and all the things that made oral BC and Nuvaring not work for me aren't a problem with the iud! PLUS I still have a good sex drive. Yay!	1
Married redditors, how did you and your spouse decide last names?	We wanted to have the same last name, he had a professional career with his name already, I didn't. I took his name.	I was born with 5 names and the only thing I cared about was no hyphenating. I was still in grad school upon marriage, published under my maiden name. So I was adamant about keeping my name till graduation, then just.... Kinda never legally changed it. A family name is important to my husband, so I use his informally and socially, but kept mine legally and in my career	0
Could you see yourself living in a "tiny house"?	I bet those are death traps. Im just guessing but i bet the people building these cut corners. If I had to live in something small I'd just get an RV	No. I feel cramped in a small apartment. I would go nuts in a tiny house. I do enjoy looking at them, but I wouldn't want to live in one.	0
Redditors who married someone of a different religion: What kind of wedding did you have and why?	Went to a Hindu/Jewish wedding the other day - it was quite a nice blend of the two cultures. The bride (Hindu) wore a sari and a Star of David necklace and the groom (Jewish) wore a kurta and a yarmulke. Apparently getting married under a canopy is present in both cultures, so there was that. Then they exchanged garlands and walked around a sacred fire as per Hindu custom. Then there was an exchange of rings which I believe is part of neither culture per se but more of a secular thing now. Then the groom got to break a glass as per Jewish culture. It was a really nice ceremony, actually!	Husband is no longer Catholic but there was some pressure to have a Catholic wedding. I was raised Pagan. We had a nondenominational wedding in front of the Welcome to Las Vegas sign! Fun wedding.	1
What is the most fucked up thing a guy has ever said to you?	I work as Princess Belle at children's parties, the dad of the birthday girl leaned in and said "Well, Belle, my cock is quite the beast." **At his own damn daughter's birthday party… what is wrong with you?!**	"You're the second best sex I've ever had and it's because I was in love with that other girl." My boyfriend said this when we're FWB, he met is as compliment but I loved him even then and it fucked me up to pretty terribly. Even now he can't seem to keep his foot out of his mouth.	1
What is a common sentiment on AskWomen that makes you roll your eyes?	That playing videos is the same as any other hobby and how dare anyone judge anyone for doing nothing but playing video games all day. Or for playing them for three hours a day. Or for anything. Like, go for a fucking walk. Pick up a book or five. Make something. It's not going to kill you to be something other than glued to your chair.	"Just get an IUD!" Yeah no, I'd love nothing more (except maybe a tubal) but in the US you can't get an IUD on my lack of income and health insurance. But Planned Parenthood will give me pills for free, so please just answer my damn pill questions and stop recommending an option that is not open to me.	0
I just had two cupcakes while trying to maintain a strict and clean diet, they were stale and tasted like shit. Ladies, what have you done recently as an instant gratification which immediately backfired and you now hate yourself for it?	Once I had a midnight craving and decided to eat a large apple to satiate my hunger. Midway through the apple I was full and wanted to sleep. I drowsily force fed myself the rest of the apple. So much regret.	Every single day: picking at my face because that will totally make the zits go away right? But I love the feeling of getting little tendrils of sebum out of my pores :(	0
Did you have a friend when you were younger, who at the time didn't seem like a bad friend, but when you look back, they really were kind of shitty?	My (supposed) best friend in high school. Got me into some really shady shit and fucked up my life for a while. Nearly tried meth because of her.	I thought because she was my childhood best friend since birth I owed her my friendship. One day it dawned on me how shitty of a person she was to me and I stood up for myself and "broke up" with her.	0
What is your opinion of Trigger Warnings?	The politically correct side of me thinks that a trigger warning is easy to do and shouldn't be a big deal. But the other side of me thinks that a vast majority of people abuse it, and it casts a bad light on actual PTSD sufferers. Case in point: TW food, TW diet, TW spiders. I mean I don't like moths, but seeing a moth isn't going to ruin my entire day. I think, especially with teenagers, there is a certain vogue surrounding being damaged, and unnecessary trigger warnings allow people to win the Damaged Olympics.	I think it's hilarious how the people who get so offended by them are the ones who are all "if you can't handle it don't go on the internet!!!!1!!!1 2edgy4u".	1
Why are you proud of yourself right now?	Thank you for this thread! We all need to appreciate ourselves sometimes. :) Tomorrow's my 20th birthday, and I've been really worried my depression would get in the way. But, you know what? I'm not going to let it. I bought myself a cute new dress today and picked out the makeup I'll wear. My fiancé is taking me out for dinner and a movie and I plan on looking fabulous and having nothing less than a blast! He got me a Disneyland ticket for a solo trip in July, which is something I've never done (but totally always wanted to do). So I'm also pumping myself up to go be independent and have a great time with myself then, too. Feeling good about life right now. <3	I successfully rehabilitated a mourning dove with head trauma even though I have very little experience with birds. I learned how to tube feed her!	0
What on Earth do y'all do with your stuff ( like keys, phone, wallet) at a club?	When I used to go to the bar I ran a tab. I carried in my card and handed it to the bartender, then all I had to do was keep up with my car key because I kept everything else in my car. Then I'd wear my key like an ankle bracelet on a budgee type cord.	My technique definitely isn't best, but I usually use my bra. Debit card slid under one armpit, phone under the other (screen side out to avoid sweat getting under the glass) and then I normally have my normal bag with my keys, flat shoes and other stuff in which I will put in the cloakroom (I assume these are also a thing in the US?). Or, alternatively, take a guy and utilize his pockets and treat him like a bag. No shame. Though regardless of where everything else is, my phone will always be in my bra. My phone and I are very attached to each other and I get vaguely panicky if it's not in my immediate surroundings, especially if I'm drunk.	0
Who is the richest person you know and how is there life different from the average persons?	My uncle. He buys everything in cash: nice cars, expensive trips, expensive clothes. He has a couple of very nice homes that he had built for him and his family. He takes family out to nice dinners and trips. He has no debt and paid for all of his children to go to college. He came from poverty. He, my mom, and their siblings were raised by a single mother who often neglected them and allowed them to be abused by her boyfriends. He worked his ass off and earned his way through college, eventually starting his own business. There's not much different in the way he lives, aside from not worrying about money or whether he can afford something.	My family. Cheesy answer, but I really believe that "some people are so poor that all they have is money." My family has community, support, love, health, happiness, solid marriages, happy kids, fun, lots to talk about, a bit extra for emergencies and fun, education, and each other. We really do "have it all." That, to me, is the richest a person can be Our lives are different from other people because we have support. We know how to navigate bureaucracy. We have a safety net. We have people to fall back on. My siblings and I all lived together at one point or other even when we didn't "need to." Money can be stolen or dissolved or taken at any time. Wealth, however, never can. And that, to me, is worth milions	1
Does anyone else feel like they can't vent to their girlfriends about crap their SO does because they don't want their friends to hate him?	I'm not personally much of a venter in general, but I am frequently vented to. My experience, in general, has been that people who vent about their SOs usually only do that. So I'm never listening to a cute story about some minor romantic gesture or about a hobby they've started up together or whatever. It's just all negative all the time. So if I'm not also friends with their SO, this is literally all the information I have about them. As a result, my impression is obviously going to be negative. I can't speak for all women, but I actually like cute stories and seeing my friends happy. Really I'd rather listen to that than venting about some dumb argument. If the venting has to happen, I'd like to hear both the good and the bad (unless the good actually doesn't exist and my negative opinion is warranted).	Never had this problem before. I think maybe you need to find new friends you can be more personal with and not judgemental.	1
What are some safety tips all women should know?	I'd recommend being armed and alert 100% of the time you leave your house. If you can't/ don't want/ are not able to carry a pistol, then at least mace, in hand, every time. Not just most of the time. Walk with purpose. Don't keep earphones in. Unless you're in the vast minority, you probably cannot beat a male- likely with nothing to lose- in a fight; use the "flight" part way, way before the "fight." Safety is way more important that manners or offending someone - if a stranger or party or situation feels uncomfortable or makes your Jimminy Cricket tick... LEAVE!	I think it's worth mentioning that you are statistically more likely to know the person *assaulting you. So I would be careful of who you hang around with, let walk you home, meet online etc.	0
What is your favorite book that nobody knows about?	Everybody knows about it, but I wish more people actually read *The Autobiography of Malcolm X*. It's so profound, and he was such an important figure in the fight for equality. I despite that he's basically been reduced to as a comparison point for Magneto in *X-Men*. He was so much more than that, and the fact that he's treated as some sort of foil for MLK Jr, instead of an ally is a damn shame.	*East* by Edith Pattou. It's a young adult book but remains one of my favorites. It combines a number of myths, fairy tales, and legends, and pulls them together so seamlessly that you only notice once you're well versed in mythology. I feel like I discover something new every time I read it.	0
Ladies who left college without graduating, how did it turn out? What are you up to now?	I'm not a lady but I did drop out of university. Was studying history. It sucks! Trying to find a crappy job but so far in vain. *Halp!*	I am back in school and doing way better than I was. I am really glad I left because I am actually pursuing a degree I really enjoy now. I dropped out after a semester, worked several jobs until I found a decent one with benefits. Realized I detested the career field and really wanted to keep learning, and went back into college around age 24.	0
What's something you thought only existed on the internet that you've experienced in real life?	False rape accusations. Attempts at, or actual, 'anchor babies.' People that lick their fingers before separating cash or pages of books - fuckin' ew. People that compare having pets to parenting in a non-ironic way Hombre hair coloring. I don't see why you'd dye your hair... in a way that looks like you can't afford to keep up the roots	Overweight young men in fedoras/trilbys. Once you know to look for them you start to see them here and there.	0
Has someone ever rejected having sex with you for something petty (like size of your nipples or what your vagina looked like)?	People don't reject because of petty reasons,but for personnal tastes. I surely had been rejected a few times, and it's not to me to judge if it's petty. The right man will enjoy my body	I have asymmetrical inner labia, and one side sticks out a little past the outer labia when it's not tucked in. My last boyfriend didn't completely decline to have sex with me, but he was very obviously put off the first time he put his hand inside my underwear. He later told me that it kind of freaked him out (his words), and that he hoped I'd eventually have surgery to correct it.	0
What's your favorite food/drink to eat during a movie/Netflix binge session?	Disgustingly cheap chain restaurant pizza. Crazy bread is choice, but lately I've had to settle for Dominoes because there is no little caesars nearby.	I will have a glass or two of red wine or if I have a snack, plain popcorn as I can have a decent amount and only eat 100 calories :) Overall I just avoid snacking in front of TV these days though.	1
Happy (U.S.) gay marriage day! Lady-lovin-ladies, what would your ideal (and now legal!) same-sex wedding look like?	I'm currently with a man that I love, but I have the potential to love women as well. I can't wait to find my soulmate, whoever they are, and ~~obsessively control~~ have our wedding! Congratulations to all the women here who can finally realize their dreams! :)	Well, since the government is coming in to divorce me from my husband and force me to get gay-married, I might as well start taking advice from here and plan now. (/s)	0
Ladies who have vaginismus and other sexually hindering conditions, how does this effect your relationships?	I have vulvodynia, which basically means that I have pain down there for no reason. For me it made even just walking painful, and it was uncomfortable to wear tight clothing. Using tampons was torture, nevermind sex. Luckily for me my gyno prescribed me a med that got rid of 90% of the pain. It also seems to be related to my anxiety, as the higher my anxiety the more likely it is that the pain will flare up. I am able to have sex as long as we take it super slow, which is annoying, but luckily my boyfriend is patient.	A girl I dated a while back had this condition, and it was horrible. I myself tie emotions and sex in a way I've found few men do (at least from my own research) and so it was particularly rough on us. To the point after a few months we simply had to end the relationship over it. Granted, I was rather sexually inexperienced at the time, and we weren't sure how to handle it. But it's still a very difficult hurdle to work through.	1
Your thoughts on a guy asking his future fiancée's father's "permission" to marry?	It's misogynist as hell. If my partner even tried to pull that crap, I'd dump him on the spot. There is no reason to even speak to anyone other than the partner before proposing.	I know some people who insist on it because it's very meaningful for them, usually as a way to involve their fathers in the whole thing. Like, it's a big deal to their dads, so it's a big deal to them. In my case my husband talked to both my parents, and just said, "How would you feel if I asked her to marry me?" I liked that better. I do think it's nice to get some family input if the woman in question is close with her family - he's going to be joining the family, after all, so it impacts them too. It's not necessary or anything, but it's a nice gesture.	0
Does anyone else take offense to all the "real women" conversations that get so much traction these days? Do we objectify ourselves?	Skinny shaming isn't that high on my list of concerns. Like.. obviously I don't support it, but it's really a drop in the ocean compared to what fat women face, so concern about it seems a bit hollow to me. Skinny is still the ideal, skinny women are still depicted all over the media as the perfect kind of woman, women are still starving themselves and developing EDs to be skinny.	It only bothers me in that I think it's stupid. We are all real women, we are all just different; thick, thin, no make-up, make-up, wrinkles, gray hair, colored hair, etc.	0
Anything creepy or unexplained happen to you lately?	This morning I woke up an hour earlier than normal to go to work. I had been hoping to go for a run before work, but I ended up passing out on the couch instead. I woke up at 0500 hearing a small kid crying. My youngest is 4 years old now and this was a newborn sound. I wandered all over the house listening to this before figuring it out as being outside our front door. I stumbled outside and the noise shut off like a light switch. None of my neighbors have newborns, so I assume it was an animal of some type. I hope.	Started seeking God again lately, went back to church this Sunday. Felt really good. Starting fresh again. I need guidance in my life right now. But I've been having really creepy dreams. Last night I had a dream, I was at a friends house with a few other people, and I felt the presence of demons all around me. They were possessing my friends, and when they tried to posses me I told them that they couldn't because I had Christ in my heart. I think Gods trying to tell me I'll be alright with everything that's going on in my life. Coincidence? I don't think so.	1
Do you think that female characters are judged more harshly than male characters?	I think they have the same problem other uncommon/minority characters have, which is that they're treated like they're supposed to represent ALL members of their group instead of just themselves. White male protagonists are individuals; everyone else has to be an emblem of some kind. So they get slammed for not being a good representation of their group, or people project their issues onto them, or they otherwise get a bunch of baggage attached to them.	That's because they're often written as complicit but let someone else do the actual dirty work (Skylar, Lady McBeth...). People don't like that.	1
What ways are your pets assholes?	My roommate's cat is the devil reincarnate. Walk past her? My leg just got clawed. Go to the kitchen? She screams incessantly. Go to let her out? She stares out the door for 30 seconds before haughtily deciding it's not good enough for her. THE LITTLE SHIT.	My Border Collie should have been a Jewish grandmother, because she is amazing at making my husband and I feel guilty. "Oh, you're going out without me? That's alright... I'm sure I'll be ok. But just in case you come back to my rotting corpse, know that I loved you very, very much"... I hate it. HATE IT!	0
How do you tinder-date safely?	I forward the guy's contact details and photos to a friend, and let them know where I will be and what time I plan to get home. That just covers your bases if something happens and you need to be found. On the date, I make sure we meet somewhere public, and I don't disclose where I live until I'm sure he's all right. I met my bf on tinder and on our first date we were joking about how we had sent our friends each other's photos in case we got murdered!	If you are legit worried about being "murdered by a stranger on the Internet," online dating maybe isn't for you.	1
Among people you know, do women sometimes treat their male partners in a way that would be considered inappropriate if the roles were reversed?	The dumb, incompetent husband is the only negative stereotype still widely used and accepted in media and marketing for a reason.	I know a few people like that. It's also a common joke that women have to "train" their husbands. I think that's ridiculous. My husband is his own person, I married him for the person he is. The only time I really ask him to change his behavior is if he does something that hurts my feelings, which is not very often. I don't see the need to boss him around like a child or a dog.	0
In what ways do you "bully" (jokingly) your pet?	He always gets "hungry" and starts meowing when I walk into the kitchen (even if he's just eaten), so if he meows too much I start giving him frozen veggies. He looks so excited for food then instantly disgusted.	All the time. I remind my derpy male cat that I already performed the ultimate misandry by taking his balls off literally. He usually just mews at me for treats after that.	1
I once pulled a knife on a guy to get him to back off me. What's the craziest thing you've done after saying 'no' didn't work?	Yesterday I got out of a cab when he was stopped at a red light. He kept asking me for my number, made me take his number and repeat it to him, tried to force me to call his number from my phone. Asked me where I lived, where I worked, said that, "we can be friends, right? We should be friends." Insisted I should call him if anyone ever threatens to hurt me (??). I tried to call someone on my phone so he would stop speaking to me but he just kept asking me to hang up so at a red light I left him a ten and got out of the car. He followed me in the cab for a block or so, so I went into a bank and he drove away. UGH.	When I was a kid, out to recess with my buddies, We had one table we all liked to sit at. One of my friends thought it would be funny to lay across the bench and take up 3 spaces. Being a kid, I told him 'move, or I'll shit on you.' He looked at me like 'yeah, right.' I decided it was time to nut the fuck up, I pulled my pants down just past my ass, and squatted over his face. Just as the turtle started poking his head out, he screamed and got up. My butthole puckered and retrieved my shit. Guy never doubted me again	1
I'm so bored at work I just realized I spent half an hour reading the patent for stuffed crust pizza. What is some weird stuff boredom had led you to do?	I was once so bored with life that I bought a road vehicle that's borderline invisible, extortionate to insure, and offers no crash protection whatsoever. it changed commuting from a sequence of rote movements to an excitement-packed thrill ride. will that bmw pull out in front of me? I can't get out of that car's blind spot--I hope he knows I'm there. did that van forget to cancel their signal, or are they about to merge into me? I don't know, but I'm dying to find out!	A few weeks ago, I was super bored with life and decided to catalog all 480 some books I own into a spreadsheet. Now I can calculate the percentage of books I own that I've actually read. It's 41%	0
Women who've lived in multiple cultures where dating/sex/love was treated differently, what have your experiences been like?	I was pleasantly surprised in New Zealand. Not only are people there more upfront about sex, but there's not a lot of "pretending to be roommates" or sleeping in separate beds when you visit your parents for appearances sake. I also got a much more casual picture of the dating scene. If you like someone, you ask them out. There's not quite as much dithering about and thinking *omg my life will end if she doesn't like me back...* And guys didn't act emasculated if women did the asking.	I haven't lived in different cultures, but my mom is from a different culture and had tried to push her cultural beliefs on to me. Things like "don't start looking for a husband until your 20s." Just that sentence alone shows what kind of differences there are. It's made my life difficult because my mother is very nosy and controlling and thinks any way but hers is wrong.	1
What does depression feel like to you, personally?	It feels like I'm struggling to stay afloat in choppy waters. No matter how hard I tread, I keep getting sucked down. ... this is why I take meds.	Like all the colour has melted out of the world, and there is this glass wall around you that allows you to be in the world but not really engage with it. And everything is muted by the voices in your head telling you how worthless you are, how pointless everything is, how little anything matters. It also feels like being so tired your bones ache, all the time.	0
Women who have their nipples pierced, what's your experience?	>Do you like them? I love them! Don't regret it at all. > How much did it hurt? It hurt really, really, really bad. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. After the initial piercing the pain wasn't too bad, they were slightly sore for a couple hours and then they were just fine. > Was it worth it? Totally. The healing process is veryyyyyy long, and I still occasionally get little crusties on the jewelry (pretty much only happens after someone has put their mouth on my nipples during sex) but I think it was definitely worth it.	It hurt. I've had mine for years... So all I really remember is that my leg flew up in the air and my piercer asked if I wanted the other done. I kept my eyes closed and told her "yes but hurry!" Totally worth it. Healing is a pain, but I love them and finding awesome jewelry for them. ;-) I had always been a bit ashamed of having a small chest, the piercings helped me reclaim pride in my body, to be honest.	1
How do men ask you out?	Well, the only one to ever succeed did so because we actually knew each-other and he asked me to something he knew I was personally interested in. Strangers asking me out or asking for my number will never be accepted.	Most recently, I went to a bar with a girl friend and as soon as we entered this guy immediately started chatting her up. I was standing there, bored, for at least two minutes before that guy's friend started talking to me. I actually couldn't hear him over the loud music, but I liked that when most guys would just start yelling or take the opportunity to get inappropriately close, he kept his voice level and remained respectful. His friend wanted to leave after a little while, and the guy I was talking to calmly and politely asked for my number. I was amazed at how confident he was--he acted like it wasn't a big deal at all, as if he were asking for a friend's number. I gave it to him. He texted me the next morning asking me out. We've been dating for a few months now.	0
What stereotype about women do you conform to?	* I own way more clothes and shoes than any one person could possibly need * The Twilight movies are my worst guilty pleasure and IDGAF who knows anymore * I constantly anthropomorphize animals and objects when I think they're cute * I scream and run away from most bugs * While I don't *love* it, I get a lot of satisfaction out of cooking/cleaning/caring for my SOs * I have perfected the skill of being friendly and polite in person to people I can't fucking stand; most people I actively dislike don't have a clue that I dislike them at all * I have had a legitimate chocolate emergency before wherein I ordered $25 of chocolate and paid $12 to have it delivered to me within 2 hours via Amazon Prime Now at 11PM	I love love love make-up, I'm seriously emotional at times, and I was in a sorority... And I have an English degree, which I always assumed was really feminine. And I love dresses and heels way more than I should. And babies. I want all of the babies. But I also like superheros (and cosplay), attempt to use logic over reason, and have been kicking ass and taking names in Math classes since I was young.	1
Do you repeat to your SO secrets that other people told you in confidence?	Unless I feel someone is somehow in danger, I keep the secrets that people trust me with. I can't imagine telling my SO someone else's secrets unless that were the case. As for my secrets... I don't really tell many people my secrets. I generally expect that my best friend might tell her boyfriend anything I don't specifically tell her not to, but it doesn't bother me because he's a close friend of mine, too.	Yup. My friendship with an SO will always beat out my friendship with anyone else. Your secrets are also not safe from my best friend. Luckily I choose people who don't spread gossip, so it ends up staying between us. :b No I wouldn't tell the friend beforehand. Yes I'd do it even if they told me not to, and I'd add "So-and-so told me not to tell you" to the information I give him. Yes it depends on what it's about: if it's interesting, I'm telling; if it's not, there's no point. And yes I'd fully expect someone with a SO to tell them my secrets.	1
Does it annoy you when family or friends take candid pictures of you?	It is annoying, but whatever. Unless they end up on social media without my permission. My mother is notorious for this. She'll post horrible pictures of me, and when I had a Facebook, tag me in them constantly. She still can't seem to understand why I don't want unflattering photos of me up for all to see...	Taking the pictures, doesn't bother me. Whatever. Posting horrible pictures of me online without asking my thoughts bothers me a lot. My mom keeps posting horribly ugly pictures of me to her flickr, and they come up when someone googles my name. So like a prospective employer sees her stupid candid shot of me finding a key lime pie gross at Christmas. UGH.	0
Have you ever felt too "ugly" to be in a sexual relationship?	Whoa. Please seek professional help and I say that in the kindest way I can. I'm guessing you're far prettier than you give yourself credit for - so what's going on? This makes me sad and I think your statement requires far more attention than input from Internet strangers. It worries me because no one else can love you until you learn to love yourself (warts and all, so to speak). This can be easily fixed! Things are not as bad as you may think they are! Hang in there, tootsie pop!	Yeah. I mean, I don't think I'm hideous or anything, but most of the time I can't wrap my head around the idea of someone actually wanting to fuck me.	0
I'm going to have my period on a 30 hour flight to Sydney. What bad timing stories do you have?	I've spent the last week looking for a decent moisturiser since I've run out, and finally caved and dropped £10 on a really decent one with SPF20 in it! Today, I got sent a sample to blind product test for two weeks... of facial moisturiser -_- at least this means I won't have to buy any for about half a year or so, but still, gutted by the timing.	* I got braces put on the morning of school pictures in 6th grade. I finally got them taken off the day after school pictures in 9th grade. * I had to complete a huge two-day test online for a big job opportunity. Unfortunately the 2 days of the test also happened to be my college graduation weekend.	0
Ladies, what examples of "office politics" have you come across in your career and how did you deal with it?	A coworker will never discuss problems. She will go directly to our boss and complain or go on a rant during a meeting. Most recently, my boss approached me suggesting I do something. Something she asked me to do that morning. I explained once again that it violated policies to do that again so soon and we would either have to order more of a resource than she initially requested or get approval to make an expensive change made to our existing protocol.	I will advise you to be careful in defending yourself, OP, as an employee with years of trust built up can easily spin something like that too make you look like not only did you do a crappy job, but now you refuse to take responsibility for it. Make sure the manager is flat lying about receiving it, rather than spinning it as a quality judgment on what was received. You can be in the right and still get screwed.	0
How does the feeling of sex with condoms compare to sex without condoms for you?	Guy here, I'm not a fan of condoms. I rather not have sex than have sex with condoms. Gf is not on bc so condoms are our only option. I've been kind of avoiding having piv as much as possible because I hate it. I try to kinda steer things towards hands and oral stuff only.	It absorbs all my natural lubrication so it gets rough reaaaal quick for me. Not a fan of condoms at all.	0
Reddit admins just announced that subs that promote raping women and the like will be banned. Will this make reddit a better place for women?	Personally I don't support the banning of any subreddit which is not actively promoting distasteful content outside of itself or consisting primarily and deliberately of content that can only exist through exploitation, abuse or any other deplorable behaviour outside the confines of the subreddit. I don't believe /r/rapingwomen falls under those criteria (it's self-admittedly a satire sub) and thus I think it ought to simply become unlisted (or whatever they're going to call it). That said, I am definitely in the very pro-free-speech camp, and I'd support anyone who decided a place that allowed such discussion is not for them. I just don't think said people should choose whether or not to blanket allow discussion of controversial topics.	I mean, it is not going to miraculously solve all of reddits problems, but it is a step in the right direction. Just because it 'might not change anything' doesn't mean that not doing anything about it is the best approach. Kinda mad that Ellen got so much backlash for banning 5 subs, and now the original co founder is banning things and there is no where near the level of backlash. Also, I am getting so much entertainment over this reddit drama.	0
Whelp, I just read a job posting for an "entry level" position that required 4-6 years of experience. I'm done for the day. What's boggled your mind and/or frustrated you today, AW?	You guys are so supportive of each other. As a man, when I have a shitty day, I get to "console" myself with the fact that no one cares. Sure, if something absolutely life changingly horrible happens, I have plenty of people to turn to for support. But just everyday average shittiness? I've got no one.	I was just ranting about this today. 4 year degree? 2+ years experience? Great! We will pay you slightly over minimum wage! Ugh.	0
What is the toughest thing for you in a relationship?	Opening up. From my experiences with past relationships and dating I now feel really uncomfortable opening up about myself and just talking about myself, my past, and my life. If someone doesn't ask me something I'll probably never tell them. It's really hard because I want to tell my current SO everything but I don't know the time or place, or how to bring up I want to talk about my life story.	Because I've dated men and women, ingrained sexism. Guys I date know I'm a feminist, but will often be unintentionally sexist or have preconceived gender roles in their head. The women I've dated haven't been as overt in their sexism, but their sexism doesn't affect me as their partner to the same extent since we are the same gender. But when I encounter it, I really have to remind myself that it doesn't automatically mean they are misogynists, they just picked up some crap in life somewhere and need reeducation.	1
Fellow ladies with a "high number" of sexual partners. How have SO's reacted when you told them. Or do you have a no tell policy? Also do you have any regrets?	Men who have a problem with my (high ish)number usually have other serious character flaws that would preclude any kind of relationship so yes, i have told people i dated, none who were a good person otherwise had a problem with it. I am highly incompatible with the type of guy for whom numbers would be a problem, anyway. I don't play numbers games on reddit because of ad hominem dudebros but like you, op, i started really young but other than that feel my number is highish normal- i just had a head start on some people. I too feel that it has shaped who i am and how i see sex and relationships, so i really would not change it. I have more regrets about my marriage than i do about the first time i had sex or the amount of people i have had sex with.	I haven't been asked any of that in so long. My husband doesn't care about my number and doesn't want to know. Sure i regret some of it but mostly i just don't think about it anymore because i don't care. My mother used to call me a slut for having sex with men outside of a committed relationship but she's cheated twice, that I'm aware of. So i guess it's ok to have a lot of sex with different people if you're IN a relationship, according to her. I've never cheated. So i have my morals in tact at least.	0
What is the worst thing you've ever overheard after the other party forgot to hang up, buttdialed, or thought you were out of earshot? How did you handle it?	My ex butt-dialed me once. However he left a voicemail, and in the message he was talking to his cousins about beating some guy's ass. A few days later, he tells me that he got into a fight and I was a wreck. It was the start of me realizing that I couldn't be with this man anymore	My parents broke up when I was in high school. My dad moved to a 2br apartment, and I would come stay with him every other week. The divorce was a huge blow to my mom who started dating and drinking a lot. Well, one day I was at the apartment by myself and checking the phone messages. There was this one new message that sounded like a buttdial, but I was curious so I kept listening. I could hear muffled voices. And then moans. And then unmistakeably my mom's voice. She had recently started seeing a new guy, so I'm assuming he was the male voice I could then hear. I'm still not sure if this was unintentional or if she wanted to shove this in my dad's face as retribution for him leaving her. I'm hoping for the former, but it's definitely haunted me ever since.	0
How does your SO initiate sex? How do you like it?	My last SO never did, and I preferred she didn't, anyway. i'm a domme. I liked taking her any time I felt. And, most of the time, she liked me doing it.	I'll be relaxing in the living room. He'll come out of the bedroom, and with a smirk say, "can I borrow you for thirty minutes?". Yep. That's how he does it.	0
Ladies, have any of you ever made the decision to step down as a bridesmaid / opt out of a wedding party?	Slight rant... I have a group of friends who is super close; Megan used to be a part of it but has slowly drifted away. Sarah got married last year, didn't ask Megan to be a bridesmaid because we never see her. Megan is super pissed, Sarah apologizes and we do find her a way to be in the wedding (carrying the bride's train). This year, Emily is getting married, and she made sure to ask Megan to be a bridesmaid because we do miss her and she accepts, is super excited. We start having bridesmaid meetings because our outfits and everything were left pretty much up to us, Megan never shows up to any of them. Always has an excuse. Stops even replying, and decides to drop out of the wedding without even talking to Emily. We found out through someone else. What the fuck, Megan??	Three times so far! Each time I didn't think I should have been asked - one was a girl from high school who is helped out s lot back then but hadn't seen in years, two was my boyfriend's friend's fiancée and she just didn't have many girlfriends, three was my flat mate's fiancé and it was because they were gender biased and he couldn't have a girl on his side. Didn't even go to any of the weddings.	1
What part of everyday adult life is the worst for you?	Having to go to work everyday. I don't even hate my job, it's just the fact that I have to go there 5 days a week or I'll starve to death that drives me crazy.	The "something's wrong I have to fix/pay for" whack-a-mole someone mentioned. I don't have the energy for it like, AT ALL.	1
Have you dated a younger guy? If so, what was the age difference. How was the relationship?	I've almost always dated younger guys, though that was by accident, not planning. If it's just a couple of years difference, it's no big deal - were essentially peers. I dated a guy for 2 years that was a little over a decade younger, with me in my mid-40s and him in his early 30s. That was fine, but in many ways we broke up because I needed him to be just a bit more of a grown up than he was.	My ex fiance was 6 years older in age, but some days seemed like he was younger than me in emotional maturity and mentality. I also had an FWB who was 9 years younger than me and while I thought everything was on an even keel, it wasn't and I had to stop seeing him because he was having a hard time understanding why not all FWB arrangements don't transition to relationships. :/ Most of the guys since have been no more than 4 years older/younger than me. I'm 32, and it seems like a comfortable distance right now. Maturity wise, I get along, but in terms of life goals I'm just not always in the same place and that's the bigger make or break than a birthday.	1
I once complained that the woman using the public bathroom was taking too long and it turned out to be Michelle Obama. What minor, coincidental experiences have you had with celebrities?	The Royalton in NYC back when it was new and chic (1997-8-9?). Had to help Christian Slater find the bathroom. It's all mirrors and he had to take an immediate shit or die. He was um sorta tweaking. Happy to have been the one to push the right mirror and save the day. Oh, and I chatted up and fucked Willow Bay that same night, in the same bar (I had a room). By far the best conquest of my life, look her up... National news babe.	I was leaving a concert and turned to chat with my date, the person on his other side was Ben Gibbard. My only response was "Oh my god." Date turns to his right and says "Oh my god." Ben Gibbard "Oh my god!"	0
So I now have TWO IUD'S because my doctor didn't take mine out before she put the new one in... What's the most wtf medical appointment you've had?	Nothing quite as traumatic here but the Dr googled what dosage I should be on for one medication. And another gave me enough painkillers to either kill me or set me up as a drug dealer. Seriously. It's like two years later and I'm still finding them.	I was once told that my pinky finger needed to be amputated. I had gone in to talk to the doctor about pains in my ribs. He had the wrong patient chart.	0
Ladies, I got broken up with. But juicy secrets always seem to bring me up. What is the biggest, juiciest, moistest secret you know and how did you learn it?	I dont know if this is juicy enough but here it goes. I have a male friend, lets call him X, who is probably secretly bisexual/gay. I learned this from another male friend, Y, after they had gone camping together in a large group of friends. One night after everyone was going to sleep after heavy drinking X went into Y's tent and started groping him and coming on to him. Y pushed him off and asked him to leave. They never spoke about it after that and acted as if it never happened, but according to Y it definitely did happen. And X wasn't confused thinking that it was a girl because X was saying/moaning Y's name when he was in the tent...	One of my coworkers (N) at my last internship got pregnant by her best friend's fiancé. They had been sleeping with each other for awhile, and they all worked in the same area together. N passed out at work a few times, and found out she was pregnant. She ended up flying home way early saying that she had diabetes because she couldn't function at hey job anymore. She's decided to follow through with the pregnancy but hasn't told anyone, so all her facebook photos are zoomed in to her face. But recently someone tagged her in the back ground of a picture at a BBQ and her baby bump is large and in charge. Her best friend commented with a simple "wtf?" Before it got deleted. I can't wait to see how this turns out.	0
Claiming Aspergers as a cop-out for being a jerk? Have any of you noticed this trend?	I dated a guy who was actually diagnosed (well, after we dated) and he wasn't any more jerky than other dudes his age (and 20 year old college kids tend to be immature jerks). I'd say his demeanor was much more kind, like he actually gave a shit about what people thought of him.	I've never had anyone actually claim they had aspergers, except as a joke. Maybe they were attempting a joke/acknowledgement of their assholeness?	1
When did you last say "fuck it" and went along with something that probably wasn't a good idea, but did it anyway?	Had sex with my FWB, I really need to stop because I have strong unreciprocated feelings for him. I didn't want to, but then he suggested sex in the shower....... it was really good and fun sex. Sigh we'll chat next week, he'll tell me he doesn't feel the same way, then I'll be heartbroken for a bit. Wicked fun.	Last weekend my girlfriend and I capped off a long day of day-drinking and Netflix binging by demolishing a large pizza and six Dunkin' Donuts in one sitting. I admit that it was my idea, but I still probably shouldn't have gone along with it.	0
Older women of Reddit: What was the key to your successful marriage?	Disagreements are going to happen. It is most important that when you least understand each other, respect each other. 27 years and counting. It is worth doing right, all the best to you.	Not a woman. Not married. But a great advice I read somewhere on similar lines was - Don't use sex as a reward you give your husband for playing along or start witholding it when you don't see eye to eye. It should always be about something that both of you enjoy doing together. Don't use it as a cookie to train your monkey.	1
How much do you care about orgasming during sex?	idk like a 7 maybe? Only because it's very easy to make me orgasm. I'd rather have a nice long session where both of us feel nice and intimate with eachother and don't orgasm rather than a quick pump that lasts two minutes that I do orgasm from. That being said I always orgasm from any sex tbh so it's not an issue.	ITT- a bunch of women who sadly have not orgasmed. Seriously ladies set aside an afternoon, with our without your ~~man~~ partner and get to it. Hell, set aside several afternoons. Orgasms are life changing. As for those myths that women can't. They're myths created by men so that they can get theirs without doing the work to get their partner's off. Ridiculous BS.	1
Ladies, what products have tried recently that are complete game changers?	Not a lady, but my girlfriend bought an epilator(sp?) and it has been awesome. She gets around a thousand times more leg massages now that she's not all prickly. And I get these weird hairs on my upper arms and that thing has almost taken care of those which I love. It hurts like hell but is totally worth. Especially if you want calf and thigh and foot massages nightly and your SO is like me and doesn't like massaging sandpaper.	I switched to buying Old Spice men's deodorant. I like the Wolfthorn. All the lady deodorants don't seem to last, even the clinical stuff. My friend recommended it (she uses Foxglove) and I don't think I will ever by ladies' deodorant again.	0
My husband said to me last night, "if you're having trouble sleeping, put some vodka in your butthole". What has your SO said lately that resulted in you blankly staring at them?	That he was planning on moving in with his mother after his dad dies to take care of her. For potentially decades. I had to explain to him that caring for an old person who has memory issues already at the age of 60 and who has Alzheimers in the family is not a thing you can do and also have a career. And also that I would really not be okay with that living situation.	In response to asking how his evening went: "Not bad. They crashed a ship into an ocean to try and wash it. Pretty much the high point." Took me a few moments of utter confusion (we don't have a ship or live near the ocean) to remember that he'd run his ongoing Star Wars tabletop game with his friends that evening.	0
Ladies in an interracial relationship, are there certain realities of your life or perspectives you have that your partner will never be able to understand? Moreover, if there are, can you make it work with that barrier?	Standards of beauty. I recently went natural/big chopped all my chemically straightened hair. My white husband wasn't the most supportive at first (I've had long, relaxed hair almost my whole life--so this was a big adjustment, even for me). It took him some time, but he now loves my hair.	Boyfriend is black and I'm white. Pregnant with his baby right now. Had no issues in any sense regarding racism so far. Hoping it stays that way. No issues with culture either as we were raised in the same place with the same culture. Everyone loves him as do I. Best relationship I've been in. Dated an Indian and Chinese guy and had huge amounts of issues with both them being disgustingly racist, racism towards them and cultural differences. Chinese culture was the worst for me as women are viewed as submissive scum. Never again will I put myself in that fire.	1
Have you learned something disappointing (not a deal breaker) about a SO early on in the relationship? How did you handle it?	He got a tattoo. Knowing I am vehemently against tattoos. It's not a deal breaker, but oh my god it was so disappointing. Still bothers me when I see it, but I'm working on it.	You all are talking about all this serious shit and I'm here in my happy corner with my boyfriend who hates pie.	0
"I feel so fat/ugly" - What is the appropriate response to these statements?	Gee, why would a woman feel fat or ugly in a society that tells her constantly that her entire value is based on her looks and she's not worth much?	I usually go with ignoring it, personally. Or switching topics. I find myself saying these thing sometimes because I... feel ugly? I mean. It's not that complex. I don't really care if the person I'm talking to totally brushes it off, it's fine. It's not like them saying "oh no, you're beautiful!" is going to make me feel any less gross.	0
Is there something you thought made a person more attractive, but then when actually experiencing it you realized you didn't like it?	First, to the OP: thanks for making it *person* not *guy.* My answer? Not wealth as in money, but, like, "uppity" for lack of better term. Turns out, I'm podunk as fuck and if I can't wear jeans to it, I don't really wanna go. I tried dating an 'east coaster' that liked to go to Polo matches and Broadway plays. Just... not my cup of tea	For lack of a better term, intellectualism? I used to think I was really attracted to well-read, "cultured" people who could wax poetic about, well, poetry. And art, music, etc. Oh man I was wrong, there is nothing more boring than dating a smart person who wants to talk at you like they're defending their thesis. Don't get me wrong, the people I date are still intelligent, but they're also *interesting* and good at socializing and can make and appreciate lame jokes and read trashy novels and fanfiction with me.	0
Am I the only woman who is totally finished at 1 orgasm? Anyone else like this?	this is why there can be no conversation on sex. you can't say shit without someone feeling inadequate. irl it's like women don't have orgasms at all. women who feel annoyed by that so they speak up on the internet. that's all it is	Me. Me. Me. It always blows my mind when women talk about having 5,6,7,15 orgasms. Like wtf is your vagina made of??? It takes considerable effort for me to cum even once. I'm a one and done person, orgasms are intense and I get super tired and kind of lose interest in anything sexual after I cum....maybe I'm part man.	0
Was just in a deep conversation with a coworker, which resulted in me following him into the mens room. What have you had a mental fail at recently?	The exact same thing happened to me last year, when I followed a coworker into the women's room. However, HR deemed that to be sexual harassment and I was fired. Go figure!	I'm blaming my mental fail on being sick and hopped up on cold meds (summer colds are the worst ugggggh), but this morning I got my coffee from Starbucks and as the barista handed it to me and told me to have a nice day, I said "you too, I love you, bye." And then it was an awkward pause before I walked away. Whatever, he deserved to feel loved this morning.	0
What is the worst advice you ever received from your parents?	My parents seem to be under the impression that the job market is exactly the same as it was when they were first starting out in the late 70s/early 80s. Also my dad yelled at me for not PHYSICALLY going to companies to give them my resume (like I'm a door to door salesman). That's not how this shit works anymore and he doesn't get it.	When I was younger my mom said that you shouldn't marry someone until you have experienced every season with them. I thought it was poetic at the time but I now realize she was basically saying to marry someone after only knowing them for a year! Hell no!	1
Women who pick the bathroom stall right next to one that is occupied when there are others available, WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?	Right? Everyone's asking why you care but it has nothing to do with being shy or ashamed...it's about choosing to go to the bathroom 6 inches away from someone in the same room when you could have gone further away...Good for you that you're comfortable with the fact everyone shits. Now be courteous and go away.	I tend to just grab the first one that I come to that isn't gross. Whether or not someone is in adjacent stalls doesn't even factor into it.	0
Those of us in not-America, what are the issues facing your part of the world?	Issues, you say? Well, there's the issue of people dividing the world into America and not-America. That's quite a big one. I'm British. The biggest issue here right now is that the Tory government is persecuting the poorest and most vulnerable members of society.	We just called an election in Canada. I'm not thrilled with any of the candidates and it makes me sad. We're also so goddamn apathetic we won't have a great voter turnout anyway (we never do). Also there are fliers circulating equating the Liberal leader Justin Trudeau with abortion because he is pro-choice. The fliers show his face and a super graphic dead fetus, and they're turning up on people's doorsteps to disturb everyone. Some mail carriers are trying to refuse to deliver them, but that brings up all kinds of free speech issues. I don't like Justin Trudeau at all (although I agree with him on abortion) but this is beyond inappropriate.	0
What's a hilarious/odd mental image that you can never "unsee"?	A local radio station pointed out that the song Pumped Up Kicks sounds like they're saying "faster than my puppet" instead of "faster than my bullet". I can't unhear it!	You know how dogs drag their butts across the floor? An ampersand looks like a stick person doing it. Can't unsee it. &	0
What is the most difficult thing you told your family/friends? How did they react?	I told my grandmother that I was raped (a week after it happened). She literally told me to get over it (using expletives). I ended up driving to a local park, crying, and pondering suicide. Needless to say, it didn't go over well.	I had to tell my parents that their youngest child (me) has cancer. That was the worst thing I ever had to do in my life. Worse than actually having cancer. They hugged me and said they'd take time off from work to come down to where I lived and be there for me after the surgery. The next day they went with me to my childhood doctor to get my medical history printed out. They were at my side when I told my brother and they were sitting next to my bed in the hospital when I woke up from the surgery. I will never forget that. And I will never be able to make up for what they went through during that time. I'll keep trying though. That was more than four years ago and I am fine now.	0
What are some of your female life pro tips?	Please, please, please, wrap up any sanitary item that you are going to throw in the trash. At my work we have several young college girls and I left a discreet note by the trash can asking them to do this. Nobody wants to look at a bloody item. *shudder*	Stand up straight and walk with authority everywhere you go. It makes you feel like Wonder Woman and people will ask you for directions even if you have no idea where you are.	0
What's a good mix dresses, skirts, blouses, slacks, jeans and tees for a girl going into the 4th grade?	I would say more casual stuff like jeans and t-shirts. A few nice special occasion outfits. If she likes to wear dresses and skirts, then more of those. Definitely a good pair of sneakers. At 9 years old, she will be able to tell you what she likes, and as an adult you know what is practical. I work in an elementary school and I would say most 4th grade girls wear a mix of jeans/shorts and skirts with cute t-shirts and sweaters. A few very athletic girls wore mostly track suit type pants and t-shirts. Let her pick her outfits within reason but make sure to get a variety :)	Let her pick out her own clothes. Strangers like us cant know her style, she might not even want skirts.	1
Would you send nudes to an SO? If so, what are your expectations on what they should do with them after a breakup?	Yes. Honestly, I expect them to delete them, because it's fucking weird to jerk it to an ex. EDIT: The degree to which some people in this thread think they're entitled to seeing a woman's naked body because she showed it to them before is fucking astounding.	I send nudes to anyone I have a sexual relationship with. I told my ex when we were dating that I didn't care if he held onto the ones I sent him if we were to breakup but that, of course, the expectation would always be that he wouldn't distribute them. I *do* expect him to delete them once he has someone new because I know I'd be pissed as fuck if I found out my boyfriend had nudes of his ex.	0
I'm a woman. I get turned on more by pictures of naked women than men. Is this normal??	My wife is like this. She is straight and has no desire to be with a woman, however, she can see a sexy woman in a porn and she thinks it's hot. We've watched lesbian porn before and she's dug that. It's understandable as the female body is just much more attractive than the male body.	Yes, it's normal. I tend to be the same way. I've seen studies that explain it this way. Heterosexual women sometimes feel a lot of anxiety about looking right when having sex. We may be more likely to be turned on by the sight of an attractive woman than by a man because the fantasy of being that woman makes us feel free to express our sexuality. EDIT TL;DR To a horny straight female, a hot naked woman is the subject of her fantasy, not the object.	0
Ladies who struggle to get dates/male attention, how do you feel when you're dismissed as "not real" or the exception?	It makes me feel like absolute shit. I hate the fact that I'm actually jealous of girls who are street harassed because I know that it is an incredibly violating thing but I can't help but think "what the fuck is wrong with me that it isn't happening to me"	This is so controllable it isn't even funny. As a stripper, I can assure you, EVERY WOMAN can get hit on, you just have to increase your marketability.	1
Women who have been blamed (explicitly or silently) for a dead bedroom, what is your side of the story?	>I'm inclined to think that if it takes two to tango, it takes two to stop tangoing. Not saying you're wrong. But you need to think this through a little better. It really only takes one to stop tangoing: your partner don't want to tango no more, they'll walk off. Unless you're proposing putting a gun to someone's head, it really does literally take two to tango, and only one to stop.	Ours was for a period of time. Contributing factors - I had an awful pregnancy. By the second trimester we were fighting almost daily. I couldn't take medication and was depressed. The only "intimacy" we had was attempts to initiate sex with me, but when the last hours were spent arguing that's just not gonna work. Following that, I got on meds. They killed my sex drive. Newborn was more than SO could deal with, so he started just not being home. Would go out as soon as he walked in to avoid helping with baby or house stuff. Came back in wasted, again would try to initiate sex when I was on about two hours of sleep, heavy medication, and pissed off. We actually did resolve both the built up resentment and lack of sex, but it took time and work.	0
Let's be honest...how painful is childbirth?	I'm not exactly an expert here, but you're getting your private parts ripped open essentially. I'd imagine it hurts like hell.	I've only given birth once but I had an epidural. Started out not very painful, like light menstrual cramps every few minutes. Then got progressively more painful. Once I hit the "I'm not sure how much more of this I can take" pain threshold, the anesthesiologist came and gave me my epidural. Easy as pie after that, I didn't feel a thing. I was singing along to the oldies station I had playing on the radio between pushes and chatting with my stepdad.	0
I just trusted a fart I shouldn't have. Ladies, what has been your most recent mistake?	I'm pretty much a failure at most things. This month I put my hand in hot tea instead of the pringles can, accidentally punched my boss in the face while stretching, have banged my shin enough times that I can't really wear shorts, dropped a bodywash container on my little toe, modified a base file on a server at work instead of my private copy and didn't realize until people were saying theirs wasn't working (snuck back into the file and fixed it), deleted the name of a public file and had no idea what it was called so had to leave it named "I'm Sorry".... And I'm only halfway through the month!	I'm in NYC and I went to get a pedicure. I instinctively turned on the shitty massage chair and they apparently charge for it. Not a huge fail, but really?	1
Women with low libidos, does it bother you if your SO masturbates a lot?	I get that sometimes you need a little extra to get into the mood, but that doesn't mean you should push the responsibility of sex in a relationship to your man. That's not fair. Not everyone's libido is the same. If your isn't the same as his, you should be ok with him "putting matters into his own hand" as an alternative to meet his needs, and yours.	No, do what you gotta do. >Would it make you feel less validated/desired if your SO just masturbated a lot more to compensate for your low libido instead of trying to initiate sex/make you feel desired? Sounds like your SO is trying to be respectful and not push you into having sex because he knows your wants/needs are lower than his. If you want to be desired, you could initiate sex.	0
Has anyone encountered more misogyny from women?	I feel as though it's common for people to feel the need to keep members of their own gender "in check." As such I've noticed that a lot of women say sexist shit to other women, and a lot of men say sexist shit to other men. I'm not a fan of it and I try not to feed into it though.	Not personally, no. It greatly depends on perceptions and worldviews and family beliefs and stuff, though, I'm sure, as a few people have called my family dynamic 'sexist,' from Mom, Dad, and siblings alike	1
Is anyone else baffled when they see people on reddit talking about how a lot of women don't realize how much men need to feel desired by their SO?	I was just thinking about this the other day when someone told me that I like people too much! When I like/love someone, I show it. I show it like crazy. I express my adoration openly and I will very happily move mountains for them. But then I'm told that guys like the chase and by showing all of this affection I'm not letting them "win". That guys need to feel like they're winning and that they've earned something in order to value it. Therefor, if they don't feel like they've earned you, they will not value you. We've all been getting mixed messages here! I imagine there are plenty of women who think they'll scare a man away by showing "too much" love and affection. Just show the people you love that you love them and if they don't like it they can fuck off. Edit: missed a word!	that's completely foreign to me. when i have a boyfriend my life pretty much becomes "Destiny's Child - Cater 2 U"	1
What is the most mortifying thing you ever did?	At least you can pass that off as a joke, OP! Haha I've done so many mortifying things. Welcome to mild social anxiety.	When I was in 2nd grade I used to think that if I cover my nose with my hand then nobody would know I was picking it. They knew. :(	0
What are your thoughts on BoJack Horseman?	I am obsessed with Bojack Horseman. Stick it out through the first couple of episodes, trust me. I did not expect it to have such depth. The episode where Diane's dad dies (not really a spoiler) is when I really fell in love with this show. I'm not sure that Zeldas will like Bojack at all though. You might have to be a Zoe to really get it.	I watched about seven episodes. It was fucking stupid and I don't know why I kept watching for so long. One of the worst shows I've ever seen.	1
What is the pettiest thing you've done to get back at/mildly inconvenience someone?	(Male, but sex isn't really relevant for this question, I think) I rarely get angry. I mean, the last time before this one was two years ago. Last week, a coworker said mean things to me (not about me, just *really* bad words). I didn't know how to react, since I just don't get angry. So instead, I 'punished' her for making me have to find a way to punish her. Didn't talk t her for a week. After that, I bought candies for her and shared with other employees.	I have two boxes of paper clips in my cube, the shiney newer ones and some grungy tetanus-y ones that came with my cube. When the CFO annoys or inconveniences me he gets his Monday morning reports with a tetanus clip.	0
Do you enjoy being naked but don't enjoy seeing yourself naked?	I always love being naked, but whether or not I enjoy *seeing* myself naked largely depends on what kind of body image day I'm having. I usually enjoy it, but some days I just feel like a manatee.	I've gotten to the point where I'm okay with seeing myself naked because I'm okay with being naked and I don't feel like I need to apologize for, like, existing. I don't look in the mirror and think "GODDAMN WHAT A HOTTIE." But I also don't waste my time pinching and poking and ranking what I don't like from worst to least terrible. Life is short, nobody gives a damn about how my tummy folds.	1
Ladies, what useful/memorable piece of relationship advice do you swear by?	It's not how he treats his mother, it's how his *father* treated his mother, that's how he's going to treat you (ultimately).	My dad once told me 'if you don't want your son to grow up like him, he's not the one'.... It's so obvious, but it took hearing those words out loud to get it to sink in.	0
What's your embarrassing childhood story that your family always brings up?	In my family's dining room there is a buffet (a piece of furniture, not a restaurant) that has a bunch of family pictures on it. One of those pictures is of a cute smiling little baby girl, which people usually assume is my sister. It's not though, it's me. I have a cousin that was born the day before me, and one time she and I were getting babysat by our aunt as our parents went out golfing. Our aunt decided it would be funny to switch our clothing, so she did. My dad loves to tell people about that and how they called me Lucretia because of it. I didn't even have any sort of control during my embarrassing story. I was an adorable baby though.	Crackers. On my 5th Christmas, my mom wrapped a stuffed elephant in a cracker box. When I unwrapped it, I yelled "**CRACKERS! I GOT CRACKERS!!**" Now I get a present in a crackers box every year. I'm 35 years old.	0
How often do you catch people checking out your SO?	I caught *myself* checking him out once... We were at Barton Springs and he'd gone to change back into his clothes. I was standing with my SIL and looked up and spotted this insane gorgeous dude. Huge muscles, tall, broad shouldered, Sandy brown hair, kinda douchey yellow muscle shirt. I leaned over to my SIL and was like 'damn he's hot...' and then as he got closer, 'oh shit, that's my husband!' In my defense, I'd never seen the shirt before. It was super douchey.	The GF - once in awhile, especially if we're hanging out with her other partners. ;) The BF - no clue. I'm still in starry-eyed NRE with him and don't notice anything but him when he's in the room.	1
What made you get divorced?	The people we grew into were not compatible. We spent the majority of our marriage living as kind-of-friendly roommates. We were together about 10 years, married for around 7 or 8 of those. I realized that I would be happier alone and single than staying in a relationship that was completely unfulfilling with a person who was not compatible with me. We discussed it and decided that we wouldn't have even dated if we met as we were then, so there wasn't much of anything to hold us together. We divorced - and I was right. My life has been amazing since then and I am now married to someone who is very compatible with me and our relationship is very fulfilling.	Guy here. My STBX and I grew apart. Together for twelve years and married for ten. The things we had in common when we met went away as we changed. There was no cheating, beating or drinking as they say. We also found new hobbies that held no mutual interest. It is an amicable divorce and although sad, we both want each other to be happy. We never had kids which makes things easier.	1
I don't drink alcohol and people give me a hard time about it. How do you feel when someone tells you they don't drink?	How old are you? I find the amount of shit you get for it decreases as you get older and it becomes more likely that you're in AA or pregnant or on medication or don't want to cope with hangovers or whatever. There are tons of reasons not to drink, many of which are pretty personal, and as people get out of the "Woohoo! Alcohol!" phase they start to figure that out.	That's a pretty big dealbreaker for me as far as dating or best-friend-ship goes. It limits potential group social activities, and I firmly believe that wine is one of the most important aspects of a romantic dinner.	1
How did an abortion affect your relationship?	I've had two abortions, both very near twenty weeks, both surgical. One to save my life, one due to disability of the fetus. We had already established prior to the pregnancy that I would get an abortion in case of bad test results. My husband was and is completely supportive. We are still together. No regrets, no depression other than wishing that the fetuses had been healthy, and our relationship is still strong. Don't be afraid. You have plenty of time to have a child when you are ready for it. Having children changes your life forever and is not something that people should feel forced into due to societal pressure.	I knew 100% that I didn't want anymore kids. We had one kid already when I was 19 and he was 21. Well two years later I was pregnant. I had an abortion at 5 wks. He was completely ok with it and supportive. Our daughter is 9 now and we are both still sure we're one and done. I've been using a long term bc with better effectiveness rates. We've been together for 11 years and married for 2. We've gone through so much over the years, the abortion was just one more thing we were able to work through.	0
How much watermelon is an appropriate amount to eat in 36 hours?	As much as you physically can. When it starts to make you gag, have one more bite and wait an hour. Then repeat.	You should eat something else. Too much of anything isn't good. Although watermelon is "healthy" and contains a lot of water it still has a lot of sugar. It's all about balancing your diet. I'd go with another snack.	1
What new things did you learn about your SO or your relationship after moving in together?	I haven't officially moved in with my boyfriend just yet. That's happening next week! 😄 but I've basically been living with him the past two months. I haven't really learned anything new since I started going to his house after work instead of my own apartment and my dog is now living at his house . . . Eh, turns out he really enjoys my pup and is so sweet. He bought her treats and is treating her new tricks. I wasn't expecting that. Besides that, nothing else was new.	I found out mine is a hardcore snuggler in his sleep. I mean, ***hard core***. Like, arms and legs wrap around me like vines. It isn't a bad thing, most of the time, it was just unexpected He also found out that my socks can end up literally anywhere. For whatever reason I can't control them	0
Do any of you orgasm too easily?	It's not quite that easy for me, but I'm still definitely a lightweight. And since I'm trans, it's pretty much one and done. I worry a lot about it, but so far it hasn't been a problem with any of my partners. I just do my best to make sure they're satisfied first.	I could orgasm from things like that, but I'd have to be putting in at least a bit of mental effort. I can basically think myself off. That said, getting off when I don't want to would be super irritating.	0
Ladies of AskWomen - Have you/do you ever make assumptions about a man based on the car he drives?	When I'm driving and pissed off, these are the following assumptions I make: huge giant pick up truck = dude with small penis nice sports car = old dude shitty looking car driving slow = someone who looks like a hipster douche SUV tailgating me = uptight looking female (usually on her phone)	If there's something that stands out, yes. If it's just an average car, nah, whatever. **Student with really nice car:** "Wow, I didn't expect that. Must have been a birthday gift, 'cause I'm pretty sure he's broke." **Student with shit car:** "Ah. Typical student car. Probably got it third-hand from his grandmother. But hey, it runs!" **Guy with crumpled car:** "Ouch! Looks painful. I wonder if he got in a crash." **Guy with very big car:** "Woah. Dude must have insane parallel parking skills."	0
Women who use dating sites, what determines if you reply to a message on a dating site?	The things I would consider, in order, when deciding if I wanted to respond: * Do I think he's attractive? * Do I feel like he actually read my profile and is trying to start a conversation? * Can he compose a message with complete sentences and correct grammar? * Do the answers to his questions (I was on OkC) indicate any incompatibilities I'm not willing to compromise on? * Do I like his profile? Generally, though, everyone would get a reply, even if it was just "Thank you, but I'm not interested."	The message they send me is a huge issue. If it is a "what's up" or "hey", they get deleted right away. That is not how you speak to a lady you are attempting to court. And it's just really annoying. Women get bombarded with messages, some are rude and distasteful (never ever respond), some are just hey (never respond). The one's I respond[ed] (no longer on dating sites) actually put something unique from their profile in their message, pointed to something in mine, and seemed genuine - not like they copied and pasted the same message to 80 women.	1
Ladies, has a man ever gotten angry/hostile toward you after you've (politely) turned him down?	Yes, at my bachelorette party. I refused all the drinks he brought me and then he got angry and shoved me when I refused him sex. I had the bride-to-be sash on and everything. He said I owed him sex for all the drinks he had bought, the bouncer literally threw him out of the bar. When we had to leave because the bar was closing (it was about an hour later), the bouncer also checked to make sure he wasn't just hanging out waiting for us.	Yes. Constantly. Do you want a 'wider, more diverse group' to express their experiences or to express the answer you want? I read your post as 'i don't like/believe what the women on my facebook said, so i'll ask here to get a different response" Which is messed up. Accept what those women told you. I really hope I'm wrong and misreading this though. oh well.	1
Women who chose a college major that everyone told you would be a bad idea - how did things turn out for you?	Undergrad: Scenography. It was the best time of my educational life, and I learned so much that's applicable to other fields and directly to life (like carpentry and electrics - those things are *useful* on a daily basis in a way that differential calculus never will be). I was constantly told that I should have gone into STEM (my graduate and post-grad degrees are STEM, btw) and that "doctors and scientists make life possible." I always retorted with "yes, but artists and the arts make life *bearable.*" I've had more theatre-related jobs than I have STEM ones, and I enjoy every moment spent working them.	I majored in social work and have a BSW. Everyone told me I would never make any money and here I am... in my 30s and still making $35k with $40k in loans. I am also just very burnt out on the bureaucracy and wish I had just majored in something more practical and lucrative like accounting.	0
What do you think is behind redditors' obsession with 'rational' and 'logical' discussion, and the dismissal of emotions even when they are appropriate?	Two fold. One because I've noticed emotions is often used to describe only specific ones. Anger is somehow excluded despite it being a very strong emotion. Two is I'm guessing based on how they've learned to debate and discuss. The way I was taught was that if you lose your cool, if you show your emotional investment in a topic, you lose on the basis that it's no longer a discussion of the idea alone, but the idea filtered through your feelings on it. That's still a valid discussion, but it is a very different one. It's the difference between discussing a topic when both parties have no skin in the game and discussion a topic that is near and dear to both parties.	I think that it's an example of white/male privilege to be able to insist that someone be unemotional about things like sexism and racism. If it doesn't effect your life, it's much easier to keep emotional distance, but that doesn't make you better at deciding about it. Privileged people tend to think it does, though, until it's something that does effect them and does give them emotions, then they realize that first hand experience can be important for forming an opinion. I also think men tend to put anger in some other category besides emotions. Being angry is normal, being sad or scared is emotional.	1
Have you ever felt used during sex? Like the guy was basically just masturbating with your vagina?	Yeah, I've had sex that felt kind of like that. Luckily, he realized afterwards that it had been a little too one-sided and offered to make it up to me in other ways. He was really new to sex in general, so I just considered it part of that and didn't think much of it. He was a really nice guy, and quickly corrected the problem.	No, absolutely not. I've never slept with anyone who didn't care about me and treat me with respect and mutual pleasure. One reason I don't sleep around indiscriminately, because I don't want to feel used	1
What makes a guy boring to you?	Just generally not being compatible in terms of interests, communication style, sense of humor, etc. Doesn't mean he's a bad person or anything, but I'd say the overwhelming majority of people just don't interest me that much.	Being too eager about spending time with me. Like when we're having dinner one night and he texts the next morning about meeting up in the evening. and on the next day. and on the next day...	1
What's your laughably horrible worst date story?	He picked some fluff out his bum crack, asked me if I knew what it was, then sniffed it. I just got up and walked away. I couldn't even make an excuse to leave.	Oh my God, I win! Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.	1
Have you ever had a friend you liked but hate who she is in social media?	>She even felt I was distancing myself (cause I didn't like her insta picture, and she noticed) and even sent me flowers. If not liking someone's instagram pictures occasionally is distancing yourself from them...I've distanced myself from my mom and like all of my friends. What on earth? Why is she keeping track? Also, sending flowers because you didn't like her picture is a *super* guilt-trip-y way for her to react.	I had a friend that I enjoyed working with, and we eventually became Facebook friends. Completely different. Super poor grammar, in the form of "ebonics" and textspeak. And her attitude was a little worse online as well. The kind of ghetto/ratchet personalities I tend to avoid. I put up with it, but I'm not all too happy seeing her posts.	1
What's the most hurtful thing your SO has ever said to you without realizing how hurtful it was?	"There's no point in talking to you when you get like this." There's always a point in talking it out.	I'm really good at doing my makeup, and used to enjoy dolling up for parties and such. He said, probably without realising how much it hurt, that without makeup you're a 4, but with makeup you're a 6 or 7! That still haunts me, years and years and years later. Needless to say we're no longer together, but I still find no joy in dolling up and making myself pretty anymore.	0
Openly bi/lesbian ladies, how old were you when you came to terms with yourself and what made you realize?	Seventeen. Finally realized why I'd watched *all* of Shakira's music videos, and that the "admiration" I had felt for a couple girls since the beginning of high school was more like a crush.	Despite intimations from a very young age, it wasn't until my teens I realized I was bi after crushing on and fooling around with folks of both genders. In college I realized I was trans after learning the miraculous new word "transgender" (the 20th century was a dark and ignorant era for us). It wasn't until my 30s, after a series of fucked up relationships with dudes, that I decided to give up on men altogether and live happily ever after as a lesbian.	1
My landlord came to do a "walk through" that actually turned out to be her giving her son a tour of the place I very much live in to see if he wants it. What is your latest "what the fuck is this shit?" moment?	My birthday. We had all planned to go out, and I recommended drinks before going to a club where this live band was playing. The day of my birthday, I texted everyone, but received no replies, so I assumed it was off. But, I received multiple snapchats from those friends celebrating without me, complete with drunk videos of themselves having the time of their lives. It was like, "Really?! Why would you do that?"	Sorry, I don't meant to be rude, but isn't that the point of a walkthrough? To see if a possible tenant wants to lease the place?	1
What are the most confusing "signals" a guy has given you?	I had a guy who would tell me he loved me then ignore me for a week. Then he'd see me somewhere randomly and tell me how beautiful I was. Then he'd ignore me for another week. And it was just set on repeat for awhile. I was sooo infatuated with that asshole.	Recently I met a guy who I was super into. He started texting me in a way that gave the vibe he was into me, not in a booty call way but in a "hey how are you?" relationship way. I was excited to go to a party where I knew he'd be at. We had a great time at the party but..Well this other girl was very drunk and all over him and it made me upset so I had to leave. As soon as I get up to go he gives me a bear hug. ???!? Idk my brain still hurts. Also alcohol.	1
Ladies,how has your SO comforted you in a time of need?	I really appreciate: 1. My husband taking care of practical things so I have less to worry about. 2. Little gifts like a nice notepad or a magazine. 3. Asking if I want a hug. What *doesn't* help: 1. Useless platitudes like "everything happens for a reason". 2. Being told that there's always someone worse off than you. I am not that someone else, I am me and this is my stuff and if it's hurting then it's hurting. 3. Trying to give me solutions if I don't want them.	He will do my dishes (we don't live together) or cook a meal if he senses I'm stressed. One night, his parents both made some rude comments while I was over, and he took me out for pizza and beer just to get out and be away from a situation that was making me uncomfortable. Honestly, just time together, rubbing my back or my hair, is very soothing to me.	1
What do other women do that embarrasses you as a woman?	Whenever girls share those "when I say go away is the moment I need you to stay the most" or the more tongue in cheek "women's dictionary" posts or anything like it. I don't think they realize it just makes women seem crazy and unable to convey their thoughts as they are. Please stop trying to make women look complex in a crazy kind of way. It just comes back to bite us in the ass. As a girl who IS very straight forward and have people always bugging me because obviously I mean to say the opposite of what I'm saying, this is VERY annoying.	Well it doesn't *embarrass* me, but as far as "setting us back," I do believe that 92% of married women in 2013 in the U.S. choosing to take their husband's names perpetuates the idea of women being every so slightly less important than men in society.	1
Is anyone else sad about the cruel jokes about Kim Kardashian?	No. Not as it pertains to her anyway. When people are rude to everyday normal pregnant women? Yes. But I couldn't give two shits about someone whose entire fortune is based off putting herself in the public eye in EVERY POSSIBLE WAY IMAGINABLE.	I think on the one hand, fat shaming a pregnant woman is really cruel. *But on the other hand*, this is a woman who exists in the public eye, and part of her persona (which she's specifically curated) is being glamorous and fashionable. And holy shit her pregnancy clothes are fugly. Like, really terribly unflattering. So I don't think "Hahaha, Kim is fat" is okay, but I do think "Jesus what the fuck brown monstrosity is she wearing?!" is fair game.	0
Women who went from very dysfunctional relationships to a very healthy one, what was the biggest surprise/eye-opener?	Seeing their name on the call display, or their car in the driveway at the end of the day, or hearing their key in the lock is never accompanied by anxiety or a sinking feeling.	It is not actually normal for a partner to be so jealous of your past relationships that he sex-shames and abuses you. A good partner doesn't give a shit about your past.	1
Why are there so many female women's rights activists/feminists that are transphobic?	I have yet to encounter one of these supposed "many" transphobic feminists, but I sure do hear a lot about them from anti-feminists, so I'm starting to think they're just part of the "radical TERF feminists boogyman" that anti-feminists like to talk endlessly about making it seem like they're all over when really they're just a tiny subset of nutjubs which every group of any type has.	Well in 2nd wave feminism there's this big idea that differences between men and women are mostly social constructs and not inherent in brain structure. 2nd wave feminists don't believe that it's possible to "feel" like one gender over the other and if you do it's because society has forced us into this false gender binary. So many of them don't think that it's possible for someone to be trans.	0
For those of you who were in an abusive relationship, when was the first instance of abusive behaviour?	Telling me that he didn't care about something I was really passionate about and didn't want me to talk about it in front of him. Also, telling me he thought less of me because I was considering doing grassroots activism as a post-college job.	He spit in my face in public. I walked away from him and he yelled after me. I stopped walking away so he would stop causing a scene and *somehow* at the end of the night he managed to get me to apologize both for making him spit in my face and for embarrassing him by walking away. Abuse, whether mental or physical, is a piecemeal process and will make you a total stranger to yourself - I still am horrified at the things I used to put up with and still have trouble figuring out how I let things get to severity they got to.	0
Have you or someone you know been a victim of revenge porn, what happened, what did you do?	When I found out my ex posted pictures to several different sites I went straight to the police to file a report. I had a protective order against him (he was abusive) and I felt like this was a violation of that. The detective flat out told me there was nothing they could do. She said they couldn't prove that it was him that out up all the pictures. He has posted my name, my Facebook pictures, where I lived, and all the explicit photos he took when we were together. She told me next time I shouldn't take let someone take pictures of me so this wouldn't happen. I was MORTIFIED. I felt that he still had control of my life. This was a year go, and he's still posting pictures. I feel so lost and powerless against him.	when i was in highschool, i had a crush on an older guy that was a senior when i was a freshman but had since graduated. he ended up going to the army after graduation, and one particular night BEGGED me to send him a sexy pic, swearing up and down he was "all alone" in his "bunk." Maybe 30 minutes later i get a text from a coworker of mine that also was alumni of my high school asking if i had a red bra on. this dude wasn't deployed at all, he was at a poker game five miles away, and showed everyone the photos. Needless to say i was mortified, and very hurt, seeing as this was before FB and i just trusted he was away.	1
Ladies that transitioned from working to homemaker, what is the good, the bad, and the ugly?	Please remember to put money away on her personal pension during the time she's a SAHM. Sahms often get (accidentally) shafted that way, and can end up outright poor in their old age.	I don't like the term homemaker-- I prefer female stay at home dad. This way I'm respected for opting out to focus my kids & artistic projects instead of vilified for being a regressive dullard. :)	1
What's the most bizarre question/generalization about women you've seen in this sub?	There was that one guy who thought women in his class were wearing the same color shirt as him to attract him. His thought process was basically "I was wearing a red shirt and then the next class this woman was wearing a red shirt, she totally wants the d, right?"	There actually was a girl that stated here that she did in fact do that. It is as disgusting as the girl who stated that she would reach a finger into her vagina to massage a very stubborn poo out of her poohole. I have never done either of those things. That is grotesque.	1
Does anyone else masturbate with cloth covering your business?	> The only way she can do her business is to put some type of cloth over her clit and rub it down to O-land. Is that the only way she can get off? :rolleyes: What about you *doing* that? :D :P	OH. I was like "what the fuck, that's a thing?!" until I realized that my lip (it's a rather generous one, sorry for the TMI) acts as a cloth for me, haha. If I didn't have my trusty lip, I don't think I'd be able to get off without some kind of... cloth, I guess. That would be waaaay too sensitive.	0
Whats something you and your SO are constantly at odds about?	We get along very well 99.9% of the time. We're never "at odds" over anything. We'll disagree on how to accomplish a goal sometimes, but we usually find that a combination of both our ideas works pretty well. Maybe your SO had an unfaithful SO in the past? That could make someone paranoid about their partner being on the phone when they're supposed to be sleeping.	If a day goes by that I don't have to put a diet ginger ale can in the recycle bin or pick up a pair of motherfucking socks, it will mean he has moved out.	0
[Serious] Married women of reddit, how did your maid of honor handle your bachelorette party? What did you do? Did you enjoy it?	My friend was the MOH for her sister and set up a bridal themed scavenger hunt throughout her hometown. The girls were split into teams and had to find everything on the list and bring it to the final location. At the end was a spa retreat, and they got their nails done and blowouts. Ended the night by going out to dinner all done up from the spa, and having a big sleepover at one of the bridesmaid's homes with a little champagne and cake. Low key, has a little glitz and glam to it, and can be perfect for this size group!	I didn't have a bachelorette party. My fiancé and I went on a date the night before and partied together. It was perfect for us.	1
This shirt is more sheer than I realized and I'm only halfway through the work day. What's your most recent wardrobe mess up?	I once shook the hand of the President of the United States wearing Superman boxer shorts. Totally slayed it. Edit: under my suit!. Perverts!	My first shift as a waitress I was wearing a really tight skirt with tights on underneath and knickers on top of the tights to hold them up (trust me it's genius). For like an hour the skirt, having ridden up, was around my waist and I was just walking around with my Superman-style get up on for all to see - I didn't notice because I had an apron/pinny thing on so it wasn't noticeable from the front. The restaurant was managed by my stepbrother, I was dating one of the chefs, and was very close friends with a waitress, and not one of those fuckers was brave enough to tell me my arse was hanging out. I literally only found out when I went outside to serve in the beer garden and felt the breeze on my little lady.	0
What is the correct response when a 9 year old girl says she is "trying to lose weight"?	If it's someone else's kid? "It's always a good idea to try to be healthy. I'm trying to be healthy too. What kind of healthy food do you like to eat?"	A 9 year old girl who weighs 105 lbs (47.6 kg) is definitely overweight and definitely needs to lose weight. It's good that she is conscious of that. However, if I were her parent, I would do my best to do that without making her feeling ugly or affect her self-worth. If she tells you that again, say something along the lines of "well, you should make sure to eat plenty of fruit and veggies then" or "drink less soda and more water". Give her nutrition advice instead.	1
Has anyone of you ever woken up because you had a very intense orgasm in your dream?	Yep. The stimulation and orgasm I experience in my dreams (usually prompted by a full bladder) are out of this world intense. Wish I could replicate it in waking life! They happen at least once a month, usually when it's been awhile since masturbating. It's been happening since I was quite young.	This is also why I feel female sexuality is more mental than anything. Physical can only get you so far.	1
Have any of you ever met a "redpiller" or someone who would qualify in real life? What's the story ?	Yeah one guy. He was in my lab group in college. Smart guy, just really socially stunted. It's sad because anyone could tell he didn't have a whole lot of confidence, and the whole "alpha-male/ladykiller" schtick was just a way to compensate. Unfortunately those types often come off as clumsy caricatures of the real "casanovas" they're trying to emulate. It's hard to make fun of them in real life. Mostly it's just depressing and you don't want to think about them too much because it's a bummer.	Isn't this one of those things where you only notice it if the guy is bad at it. Almost all of these comments are about socially awkward guys, who then try and compensate with trp stuff, but they are still socially awkward in the first place. Do women think/realize that it is effective when done right (even though that's entering no true Scotsman territory)?	1
[Serious] What does an abortion feel like?	I want to ask a few follow up questions: 1) Did you tell the guy? (one night stand? boyfriend?) 2) If you did tell them, did they go with you to get the procedure/meds/clinic in general? 3)What did you learn from all this experience? (i'm not trying to shame you or anything, just wondering what you think you could have done differently before)	surgical, 2009. was lightly sedated. it felt like really intense cramps and a little bit of scraping. i cried after. i cry a lot, tho. then, overwhelming relief. some loneliness. mostly relief. i felt loopy for the rest of the day, and then sore and crampy for a day or so after. felt kinda "raw" inside for a little while? the nausea stuck with me for a few more days while my body got back to normal. i threw up a ham sandwich.	0
Any "right person, wrong time" stories?	I met my boyfriend when I was 14 and he was 17, at the time he had a girlfriend. We clicked right away and became good friends but knew that a couldn't be together because of said other lady. Well to make a long story short, we celebrated our 7 year anniversary yesterday :)	I literally just had the "it's not you, it's bad timing" conversation less than an hour ago. I understand. He has a lot on his plate and more coming his way. I get it. He doesn't want to string me along if he can't be there for me 100%. I truly appreciate his honesty, but.....it hurts Trolls, it fucking hurts.	0
Do you ever feel uncomfortable hearing some men talking about sex in a predatory way? What drives this behavior?	In all reality this is done by both sexes. Some times your personal ideas don't match with others, that is part of the beauty of life.	I used to bartend and I had co-workers tell me that customers had said these sorts of things about me on multiple occasions. It made me feel like absolute crap. That these people I'd been nothing but friendly were talking all this disgusting, disrespectful stuff about me behind my back like I had zero sexual agency. Made me want to shower for an hour and then wear a burlap sack for the rest of time. I think it shows a huge lack of empathy and inability to relate to women as people. I've never heard anyone I respect talk about women this way. I assume they don't think of women as equals.	0
How sick are you before you decide to call in to work?	There are three solid rules: If I am feeling so unwell that I can't concentrate on something like writing notes even with medication, if I am worried I have something contagious that could harm my coworkers' children (e.g. something with a bad fever, strep throat, pink eye, gastro), if I would need to make frequent and unpredictable bathroom trips. Or any combination of the above. If you work in customer service, especially serving food, or if you work in a medical profession with patients who are in compromised condition, I think it's totally cool to stay home for anything that might be even somewhat transmittable.	I stay home from work when I'm feeling even slightly sick. I always resent it when people come into work sick and I catch it, so I'm not going to do that to other people. Sick days exist for a reason. On the other hand, I would only miss class if I was dying because professors give no shits.	1
Pet owners: What does your pet do that makes you smile?	My kitty is a complete and total cheese fiend. Any cheese left unattended in the house is his. He's not as pushy about getting food from you as some cats, but he's really sneaky. He'll try to lull you into a false sense of security by being super snuggly, then take a lick of the cheese while your guard is down. Either that, or he'll remain out of sight and when you forget and leave the room for a minute BAM he's face deep in your cheese. There have been times when he's been so sneaky about it the only reason I knew he'd done it was the tongue marks on my cheese.	I'm so sorry for your loss. My dog makes me smile every time he sits down. I don't know what has happened to his body as he's aged, but he always lets out a fart when he sits or lays down, and then he looks over his shoulder like "what the fuck was that?" I don't know why, but this still cracks me up every time.	0
Has your partner ever told you they found you less attractive after you LOST weight??	Yes, he has. I'd lost far too much weight accidentally due to other factors in my life when I was very busy and skipped meals often in order to study and work. I thanked him for his concern and honesty and put on some weight. If you can't tell your SO how you feel about their body honestly, then the fuck kind of relationship is it?	I have a friend who was 300+, dating a thin girl who liked bigger guys. He hit an emotional moment of severe depression and decided to start losing weight, during his insitutionalization after an attempt, she cheated on him, and then again as he was losing weight. He became very cynical about women in general and upset but fueled his desire. Many years later he is a crossfit instructor, 180ish and very fit with a new girl who seems to be perfect for him. People r shit.	1
What term do you use to describe your relationship to your pet (e.g. "I am my dog's ________")?	I'm my cat's owner. I am not her mother, her mama, her mom or her parent in any way. That is gross to me, and I always correct the vet techs who refer to me that way. I love my cat to death and she is the closest thing to a baby I'll ever have. I love her so much and she gives me a reason to get out of bed on my worst days and I dote on her. But I am *not* her mother in any way.	I am my cats' housekeeper, doorman and chef. Just kidding, I am their person, and they are my prisoners with Stockholm Syndrome.	0
Would it be an issue if your SO didn't want to wear a wedding ring once you were engaged/married?	Call me cheesy, but I think wedding bands are romantic. I don't see it as cheating prevention, but rather as a sweet gesture, i.e. "I'm proud to display that I'm bound to my SO for life." Yes, it would be an issue for me if my SO didn't **want** to wear a band. However, if he were in a particular situation in which wearing the band posed a danger, then I would demand that he take it off.	My parents have been married 33 years and my dad's never worn one. I don't care if my future husband wears one, because let's face it, a little piece of metal doesn't make a man honourable. I will probably wear one because I get hit on mercilessly.	1
How often do you have sex vs how often would you prefer to have sex?	Whenever I can and way more. When I get to be with my "FWB," I guess you'd call him, we have sex anywhere from six to nine times a day for three days, but I'd prefer at least steady two a day every day.	I have sex once or twice a month, at the moment. It's usually once a week. I prefer every day, maybe every other day and 2-3 times a day on weekends.	0
What's something obviously designed without the input of any women?	Jars. And soda bottles. Can't we really come up with something with more grip to make it easier to open without requiring a boyfriend? Damnit!	Girly versions of things. There are sometimes practical considerations like making things smaller, or easier to reach, or lighter.. but never pinker. And they're so, so often pinker. Pink hammers, pink drills, pink golf clubs, pink sports jerseys (so no one can tell who you support from a distance), I'm pretty sure no one ever asked for these things to be the *only available colour* most of the time.	0
Childfree women: what was the worst thing anyone said about your decision to not have kids?	I only sort of can answer.. Regarding fostering and not having bio. kids, anything referring to my family as broken or incomplete or when am I having ~real~kids.... Insulting on so so many levels. I reply in a way that reflects the asker: the douchier they are, the more kurt I am	I have an adopted child. I've been asked multiple times when I'm going to have a real child. Seriously. Once my parents said it. in front of her and they were banned from seeing her ever again (I cut off contact from them years ago over stuff like that). I get asked if I have a medical condition or I get asked if I don't want to ruin my perfect body (from creepy guys). The crazy thing is: I have a daughter! I raise her! She is my soul! And people still say these things!	0
Do you judge people who wear the same clothes two/three days in a row?	It's unsanitary (to a certain extent depending on what you do), so I would think that you don't have enough clothes and would probably feel bad for you. I don't judge genders differently.	Eh, I wear some clothing items several times before washing them. Like, the weeks I'm working I'll go to work in the same clothes (sweater + trousers) all week, because I wear a uniform at work. At uni I do change my top every day. I feel like people don't notice your jeans as much. They don't know if I'm wearing the same pair of black jeans as I did yesterday or if I own 10 pairs of black jeans.	0
I just found out I have 10 cavities. How has life disappointed you today?	My boyfriend told me he's going to Africa with his family for Christmas and New Years this year. I live in the U.S. and I'll have no way to reach him when the ball drops.	I transferred $4000 to a closed account by accident and now it's gone missing... How can it go to a closed account?? Why the fuck didn't it bounce?? Why was I dumb enough to do that????	0
What's an issue that society is in complete agreement about, but you're skeptical?	I say this as a genderqueer bi/pansexual person: I don't agree with the seeming majority of the LGBT+ community that a person's sexuality is basically the main part of who a person is. I don't think it's necessarily healthy or beneficial to describe one's self first and foremost by your sexuality. It is part of who a person is but I don't really agree with the huge focus on it as a defining characteristic. Edit: a word	In America at least, I'm totally against this new social justice movement going around. People are losing careers and being ashamed into not speaking their minds. People will throw their arms in the air to not censor movies, music, and art, but God forbid someone thinks Caitlin Jenner is mentally ill.	1
In the last three weeks I've been laid off from my job, my SO ended things, and I'm moving back to the suburbs to live with my parents. How do you cope when nothing seems to be working out?	For me, video games distract me from such issues. It can take some effort to get into, but you can usually get into a "zone" where you're just completely involved in the game and distracted from whatever is troubling you. I find this works better than stuff like inbetween jobs and the like that others have suggested, presumably since video games can leave you without any downtime and are actually fun as opposed to just work. Although it probably comes down to personal preferences, too.	It always passes. It fucking sucks, sometimes for a while, but eventually it just becomes a memory of "that shit sucked, glad it's over now." I know that's cliche advice but it's totally true. A year and a half ago I moved across the states after a breakup, sold my house, and had to love with my parents for a month before getting into my apartment. I remember being in Butte Montana and I've never felt so alone in my life. Now I am gainfully employed, own a home in Seattle, have an awesome little dog, and am planning to get engaged. "This, too, shall pass," is solid advice.	0
Do any of you NOT work out? How do you feel about it?	I usually do not work out. I feel fine about it because I am thin and pretty healthy anyway. Sometimes I think it would be nice to put on some muscle, but I would struggle too much to eat at a calorie surplus, so meh.	I am currently not working out. I hate working out, and often I'll go force myself to do it because it's good for my health. But it's really never something I start to _enjoy_ and minor things such as it being too hot or cold out, or a schedule change, will cause me to stop. I am generally happier when I don't have to go work out honestly.	0
What annoys you more than any fucking thing in the world?	People who sing along to shitty music on the radio. Not just a chorus here or there but singing every song from beginning to end. And on that note, pop-country music makes me want to slit throats.	People that congregate in front of doors or walk abreast on the sidewalk really slowly so that it takes forever to get around them. It's just a totally different mindset than I have, which is to always be looking around to see if I'm in the way. In a twisted way, I wish sometimes I was more oblivious.	0
How should a guy initiate the first kiss?	Look, there's nothing foolproof. If you're looking for body language and situational cues you're on the right track, and if you sometimes get "the eyes" and sometimes get a kiss, you clearly don't "always" fuck it up. Personally, I don't mind at all if a guy asks if he can kiss me or says he wants to—much prefer that than a guy I'm making awkward polite chitchat with while his friend shifts my friend at a bar suddenly trying to shove his tongue down my throat—but again, it might not work every time and that's kinda just something you have to deal with.	If this sub has taught me anything it's that you ask her, then get express written consent, signed and notarized.	1
Halloween is coming up! In your opinion, what is the sexiest costume that a man could wear?	I'll be going as the perfect physical, mental, and spiritual being. The truth, the light, and the way. I do this every day naturally but I'll do it in a sexy way on halloween. So that's what I suggest.	Ancient warrior of some sort. That would do it for me. Egyptian, Greek, Celtoi...doesn't matter. It hits all the right notes. Anne Rice vampire, yeeees. However, funny is sexy too. Though a guy in a sexy costume would make me turn me head, I'm also less likely to approach them. Funny is more approachable.	0
Is anyone else jaded from the dating scene?	I feel the same way. The big problem that I keep running into is either I'm interested in them and they're not interested in me or vice versa. It's never both parties being interested in each other.	After reading your replies here I am thinking you feel this way because you have no idea what you want. You switch back and forth between appearing to want a serious boyfriend and having a fling with your current guy. No wonder guys run from you like animals from the forest fire. Guys who are looking to just fuck are not getting it from you and moving on, and more relationship oriented guy can see that something is off about you and don't want to see you again as well. Figure out what you want and focus on getting that. I think you are going to be much happier then.	1
What is your personal Planned Parenthood story?	I LOVE The Hood. I have an alter ego named Kiki who is an older jewish lady from New York. I regularly prank call my hood ladies and try to order birth control. They love it, they say it breaks up their monotone day. Anyways, since day one they have given me un-judgemental care. For me though the biggest deal was my first Herpes outbreak, they were kind, gentle, and had no judgement. I can't coo about my Hood enough, they have been there for me thick and thin.... Actually I owe them flowers.	When I was 20 I was in a horrible, abusive relationship and I got pregnant even though I was on birth control. I went to planned parenthood and found out. I scheduled abortion services which killed me emotionally. The women were so supportive and told me that at any time I could leave because I was clearly upset. It was the best decision for me and made me feel empowered to leave the relationship I was in. I truly appreciate the women who were there for me and supported me.	0
What is the dumbest thing your SO has been mad or annoyed at you for?	A few responses from my husband. I got a ticket on my way home from a friends house while he was deployed, I told him and he wrote back "You can even be trusted!" Uh... trusted? With what? Following the rules of the road? Obviously we know that! I got a ticket! Recently he's out to sea again and last week I fell while holding my open new macbook pro, the screen cracked in a few places. "I'm never ever buying you a new laptop ever again. And I'm not paying to get it fixed" :O That was a bit extreme. "Don't feed the cat with those small plates, we use those!" Should I not wash the kitties bowls with the same dish sponge either?	One of my exes got pissed at me for going on vacation with my family for ten days. It was my birthday present and they offered to pay for him and get us our own room and everything, but he said no. He called me and yelled at me several times and finally I broke up with him a week into the trip.	0
Have you ever lost attraction to an SO over something that was outside their control?	Yes. He was quite short but otherwise attractive and funny so I gave him a try. I just couldn't find him attractive though. I couldn't see him as a man. Also his dick was unfortunately proportionate. I feel so bad for the guy	Yes! One of the first guys I kind of dated right out of high school. Sweet guy but had a falsetto'ish voice. I really tried to get over it but no, just couldn't. I sadly did the fade. Ran into him years later and nope, still couldn't get over it.	0
Has anyone actually had TSS from tampon use?	I did and almost died. I used kotex, only had it in five hours. Spent two weeks in intensive care. I only use pads now and urge you to do the same.	I've never known anyone who had TSS, though I do have a weird recurring paranoia of it myself, despite the fact that I regularly sleep with tampons in and apparently once was paying so little attention that I accidentally put two tampons in at once and only noticed when I pulled on one string and two of them came out. God knows how long that first one had been up there. Anyway, you're probably fine. Just change it regularly.	0
How old are you and how much do you have in your savings account?	I'm 23, have about $700 in checking right now and no savings account. And I owe $80k in student loans.	22 and -$650. -$70,000 if we're counting student debt. I'm so jealous of everyone who replied. But one day. One day, I will be free.	0
What are some books that every woman should read?	A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini. Gives a woman's point of view in a place where woman have no rights(Afghanistan). I highly recommend this book to everyone.	Taking Charge of Your Fertility, by Toni Weschler. Even if you don't plan to have children. *to note: I'm not sure that transwomen will get much out of it, and I apologize for leaving y'all out.	1
Do you think most men are physically unattractive?	TIL: Most women find personality much more attractive than physical looks. I can finally eat that extra piece of cake!! ahha	I think most men are just kind of neutral. They aren't gross to look at but they aren't what I consider hot either. And that's more of a personal preference thing. My baseline for attraction with men I don't know is neutral, and many will become attractive once I get to know them. It's very rare that I'll see a man I don't know and instantly think he's attractive. It happens, but not often. Edit: I do think the majority of men I see out in the world could stand to put a little more effort into their appearances. Wear clothes that fit, for example. It does wonders.	0
What is something that's constantly brought up on reddit, but you never encounter in real life ?	Trusting a fart and pooping yourself. I have a pretty finicky digestive system and weird poops galore, but...I know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em.	(surprised to see some brogressiveism on this sub wow) i've never encountered "misandry" that reddit loves to claim feminism actually is	1
When you are in a relationship do you still accept offers to have coffee or "hang out" with other guys?	Depends. I have male friends with whom I drink coffee, go clubbing, everything. But if it's someone I just met I'd make sure he knows that I have a boyfriend, just to prevent awkward situations in case he was thinking about being more than friends. But when it's clear that I have an SO, I see no harm whatsoever in drinking coffee with a guy.	Yeah, but only someone I am already decent friends with. I am bi so if my partners had issues with it, then i could never hang with my friends.	1
What's the most hurtful thing anyone has ever said to you?	Years ago I dated this guy who was incapable of expressing affection or initiating sex or looking me in the eye and thought that buying me expensive gifts and insisting on paying for everything would compensate for that. Years later his best friend, who I *thought* was also my friend, called me a gold digger. Repeatedly. The real kicker was that there was a time when I had all the intention, drive and motivation in the world to go out and get the six figure salary necessary to support my ex's lofty creative delusions. Kind of embarrassing for me to admit now, really.	When I was 13, it was a thing to have your phone number in your status on MSN. I didn't have any friends but as a 13 year old, I was trying to fit in, so I put mine in my status. One girl's display name had a bunch of different people's names in it, indicating that she was having a party. I got a message from them saying, "omg LOL who the fuck would want to call you???? :D:D:D". I started crying and just said "i don't know" and removed it from my status. It was hurtful because it was true, I had no friends, and no one who would want to call me. Someone pointing it out was humiliating. The girl was a bridesmaid at a wedding I attended last year and it stirred up a lot of bad emotions.	0
What's an aspect of female anatomy you are surprised many men or women don't know about or are overly squeamish about?	I'm beyond the point of surprise, but too many men and women are insufficiently aware that "female anatomy" is a meaningless term since many women have penises and many vulvas are attached to men.	I hate to generalize but I think a lot of men just think 'Tits are great!' and don't realize what a burden they can be or how much they can hurt at times. My SO doesn't really take it seriously when I mention they are super sore and can't be fiddled with.	0
What's the most awesome thing anyone has said to you?	When I first started dating the boyfriend, I asked him if he was sure he wanted to keep seeing me considering the distance. There was something about how casually he said, "Yeah, you're worth the effort" that made me a ball of happiness.	My husband and I walked out of a gated condo complex to a surface street in Vegas near the strip and this group of drunk people are walking by, one of them, a big shirtless guy turns to us and yells "TITTIES IN YO FACE! TITTIES IN YO FACE!" It was alarming and so unexpected at the time but we often laugh about it and say it at random inappropriate times.	1
How many of you stalk ON FACEBOOK - Exes, exes new partners, Exes...exes, People you don't like? How far have you gone? For how long? WHY?	I don't even use facebook.. it's toxic, in my opinion. I try to allow people to have their space and privacy and tell me things as they choose to, not stalk around trying to be nosy. A couple times in the past I've quickly checked on people just because they had been out of my life for awhile and wanted to see how they were doing but nothing creepy. That's one of the reasons I try to make it difficult to search for me, honestly. It's fucking unnerving thinking friends, family, or a partner might try to look that deeply into my life without me knowing. It's nothing I wouldn't tell them anyway - it's just the idea of it.	I stalk everyone, all the time. Seriously. Once, I got as far as my ex's ex GFs old Livejournal that hadn't been updated since 2008. I'm a master stalker and i'm not ashamed.	0
When it comes to dating, what do you think is the biggest misconception men have about what it's like to be a single woman?	The " Why are you not in a relationship?! You're great!" *women don't have to be in a relationship throughout their lives* Some are single because they *wanna* be.	That we have orbiting men around us all the time and that we aren't rejected. My friends have had men 'ghost' on them frequently after what they felt was a great, successful date. This ignores women who appear unapproachable, unattractive women, or even average/attractive women who aren't social butterflies.	0
What can you eat a lot of without it adding up to a lot of calories?	You could eat stuff that is high calorie so it fills you up longer and the you don't have to or want to eat a lot of it.	Celery. Carrots. Sugarless gum. Salsa. Tomatoes. Spinach. Green peppers. Cabbage. Radishes. Most things I don't really want to eat (love tomatoes, though!).	0
What are some cute things your SO does that makes you appreciate them more?	He stays downstairs with our baby so I can get some sleep before he goes to bed. Our son is a noisy sleeper so even when he sleeps I sometimes can't if he's close by.	He leaves for work at 6am, I have to get up at 6. Before he leaves he wakes me up with coffee and lies down with me for 5 minutes for cuddles. I love that	0
Women who live alone, what are some of your tips/advice/life hacks/etc for other women that live alone?	I'm very much an extrovert, so I find living alone a bit challenging. Find scheduled ways to see people in the evening -- TV watching with friends, or bar trivia, or a class, or something. Otherwise, I crave going into the office just so I can have social interaction.	The last thing I wanna do when I'm sick is go out to the grocery store. Keep food on hand (soup, crackers, etc.) that you like in case you come down with a flu or cold.	0
What are some free/inexpensive things you do when you're low on cash but still need to get out of the house and have fun?	There are 2 theaters near me that have $5 movie days. I'm sure if you look there's at least one in the area that offers the same deal.	Hike, take pictures, or a combination of both. For instance, I've texted a friend and asked them to give me random items for a "scavenger hunt" that I'd take pictures of for proof to show them I found it. Stuff like a lady bug, wild berries, a spider web, etc. (mostly natural things because of the locations I choose to go to). So then I go off looking for the things they told me to find.	0
This morning I heard a guy catcall a woman on a bicycle. He was driving his employer's van. His behaviour disgusts me; should I contact his employer? Or just let this go?	Let it go. It's not your problem and I don't really know what the employer should do. That's just my opinion, it's one of those annoyances that happen.	If you decide to make the call and need to describe what happened, the whistle was probably a "wolf whistle." Just so you're not stuck trying to imitate the whistle at some supervisor who takes the call. :)	0
Hey Friends. What responsibilities are you hiding from today?	Work. I have a lot of shit to do but I do not want to do aaaaany of it. I'm sitting here on a YouTube journey through 90s and early 00s pop music instead.	well, i'm on reddit at work but that's kind of normal... i watched two drug deals happen right outside my work window today and i did nothing. next time, however, i will not do nothing.	1
I'm afraid I'll never own a home and never have money for retirement. Any other ladies in the same boat?	I'd like to highly recommend the book *I Will Teach You To Be Rich.* It's full of practical advice with specific steps to take. It's easy to get overwhelmed with finances. But you can do it, OP! Do it for your future self.	I feel the exact same way. I feel like I'm a good 5 years behind everyone else my age. I know that not all people in their mid 20's are doing well, but I never meet anyone who is doing worse than me :(. I've never even had a full-time job (I've applied to thousands of jobs and still only manage to get the low paying part-time jobs) so I'm not able to save up. I'm currently working part-time and I'm barely making any money. I really don't think my life is going to improve. Why is it so difficult for me to get a decent paying job with benefits?	0
What has your ex ruined for you?	video games - I don't play, but I will never ever date a guy who plays video games as a hobby.	People named Kevin. My first two exes were both named Kevin. Now I just feel immediately and unfairly suspicious of people I meet named Kevin.	0
Women past child-bearing age: If you never got married or had children when that is what you really wanted, how do you find satisfaction within your life?	ITT: Women upset with the wording. What if she said: Women who really wanted marriage and children but couldn't (for whatever reason), how did you fill that void? It's not that great of wording I guess, but I don't think she's trying to offend you all.	I have kids and and find the wording of this question, implying a lack of satisfaction with a woman's life sans motherhood, to be offensive. I do hope that you didn't mean it that way. But even having kids, I find implying that my life's satisfaction revolves around them to be an incredibly limiting and one dimensional idea of me as a human.	1
How do you keep a cool head during a date when you feel like jumping your date the moment you see them?	Honestly, if your sex drive is this different... Is see that as a red flag. Don't opt in to a dead bedroom.	On my fourth-ish date with the guy I'm seeing I was very much under the impression he wanted to go slow. Like, so slow. Like, he had barely touched me the previous dates. I would've thought he wasn't interested if he hadn't also talked to me frequently and planned every date. Well, on that date we talked about what we were looking for. Then he wouldn't keep his hands off me! So, it could be that he's just not sure where you're at and is just waiting for the ok. As for actual libido killer, eat gross food. But, then if things do go to sexy time you might still be uninterested...	0
My ex's family called me to apologize for his behavior and tell me how much they loved me and were going to miss me. What're your small victories for the week?	The bank gave me back my money in full!! I accidentally transferred it to a previous travel card that was closed, and when it didn't bounce I had to spend hours on the phone tracking it down. 2 weeks later it's back!! I'm not poor anymore!!!	Sat down to read the newspaper yesterday morning and saw a douchey former classmate from highschool was arrested for heroin.	1
Did you grow up as the "really pretty" or "really smart" girl? What was it like?	"really smart" - top of the class without opening a book smart, perfect SAT scores smart, finished two hour exams in twenty minutes smart. It was ok. I've never wanted to be stupid, and I'm also pretty - even if not exceptionally so - so I don't really feel ugly. I *do* wish I'd had to study at some point in my life before the age of 20, because fucking hell, I had no idea how to.	I won't call myself the "really smart" girl in school, but I was the one that was just supposed to *know* everything and have all the answers. If I couldn't figure something out in groups, people would actually get snippy with me despite the fact that they weren't doing any better. It was frustrating.	0
What issue related to feminism or gender equality are you on the fence about, and why?	I would like to see a lot less male bashing. It sucks to observe because I have a son, a step-son, an SO, a brother, friends, co-workers, and clients who are good men and I hate to see all men lumped together as the ultimate evil force. Equality doesn't come by *taking* from one group and *giving* to another group; it comes by making opportunities accessible to *all* groups. Bashing men does not further the feminist cause, and it's a big reason why moderate women like myself stay as far away from the movement as possible--because we have men we love. It's also why men who would otherwise support the cause shy away--because they themselves don't want to be subject to the unfair vitriol.	Embracing periods. I'm all for making them less awkward to talk about and less disgusted by. But free bleeding, period art sets, saving your blood, worshipping menstruation as this big ideal of femininity - I don't get it	0
Are you currently dating a man shorter than you? What's it like?	I just went on a first date with a guy that was shorter than me. I also was in heels. Other than the initial observation ("Oh, he's on the shorter side!") I didn't really notice much. He was attractive, he was interesting - height is generally not something I dwell on much.	My ex was three inches shorter than me (I'm 5'10). It was fine when we kissed and the sex was good too, but next time around I'm definitely sticking to my rule of dating a guy either my height or taller than me. The taller, the better.	1
Women who haven't been in a relationship in a long time, do you feel uncompelled to remedy that?	Pretty much, yeah. Singleness is a comfy enough default for me, so I don't see it as something that needs to be remedied.	I've more or less defaulted to it. I've gained weight, hit 30, and am therefore finding ways to be content with being forever alone.	1
Have you been with someone older (7+) while in your teenages years? Did you regret it after growing up?	Since some people want a bit more information on my situation : I am 15, he's 24. I'm not that worried about it, except of course for my parents reaction. He's more worried about it being wrong than I am. I also seem to see a lot of posts here agreeing with the fact I shouldn't be with him. I just have trouble understanding why. He really makes me feel happy. I just don't feel attracted by people my age, I find them too immature.	When you're 15 and dating an older guy, you feel like the coolest girl in the world. When you hit your 20s, you will realize just how creepy and weird that guy must have been.	0
What makes you feel discouraged at work?	When some people can get away with certain things that not everyone can. At least once a day someone does something that makes me think "I'd get in SO MUCH TROUBLE if I did that!"	I work with kids as a speech therapist assistant/student. I work with three different kids. Two of them are so sweet. They are tough to work with but their sweetness makes up for it. They give me hugs and so many smiles. One of their moms told me that her child says my name at home and it made my heart melt. One of the kids is not very lovey though. He is just tough to work with without the incentive of him being sweet. He just wants to do his own thing without me. I like helping him but I get much more satisfaction out of helping the other two kids.	1
Ladies, what back-handed compliments have you been given?	*I thought you were such a bitch until I actually got to know you.* I've gotten several variations of that comment over the years. Resting bitch face is real. :(	"You really seem to have it together for a 20-something". I'm 26, and to my way of thinking I *should be expected* to have my shit together, but apparently I'm alone in that.	1
Ex dumped me a week after he arrived in a another country as an exchange student for 4 months, not even two and a half weeks later he's in a relationship. What has an ex done that made you think, really dude...?	this thread makes me sad.. im a guy and these dudes sound like total assholes i got cheated on and id never do it to anyone	Soliciting one of my close friends for a hookup via Facebook within a week of us breaking up. REALLY DUDE?!	0
What are the seven erogenous zones as mentioned by Monica in 'F.R.I.E.N.D.S'?	1. Left eyeball 2. Nasal philtrum 3. Right elbow 4. Right buttcheek 5. Left buttcheek 6. Popliteal fossa 7. Underloaf	Guy here... in my experience a woman's erogenous zone is.. her whole body. While some parts are more sensitive than others (And there are plenty of good lists so far in this thread) most women love to be touched everywhere. Meaning, let your hand travel from spot to spot in contact, not just jumping. Let her feel the anticipation of your next stop through her skin. My SO goes crazy when my hands are on her stomach and she doesn't know if I'm going to move down... or up.	1
Do you cuddle when you sleep? Or are you are non cuddler?	I'm a cuddler, my boyfriend is a non-cuddler. Also, he's a SUPER light sleeper, and I snore. So this is how we fall asleep pretty much every night: 1. Him on the outside of the bed, me on the inside. 2. Fan directly by his face, blowing at top speed to help drown out my snoring. 3. Earplugs in his ears to further drown out my snoring and any other noise. 4. Me sleeping with my back to him so my face doesn't dry out from the fan *and* to redirect my snoring away from him. 5. Butts touching to accommodate my need for physical touch. Also, though, we spend 20-30 minutes cuddling and kissing and talking before we get in our sleep positions mentioned above, and that helps me get my cuddles in too. He loves snuggling, just not when he's trying to sleep.	On the one hand, I like it as it helps to settle me and stop me from tossing and turning so I can get to sleep faster. On the other, it can get too hot and there's times where I just have to be in a different position. My SO is a total sleep cuddler though. He'll be sound asleep and I'll make a tiny movement and suddenly he's cuddling me so hard that I can't move an inch. He's totally unaware of it as well which makes it cuter.	0
Do you experience secondhand embarrassment? When have you felt the most embarrassed for someone else?	Yeah, my mom doesn't always think before she speaks. She often asks women "when they are due" and doesn't realize they're just overweight. :/	Yes. So much that I want to find a way to fix it. Sometimes I will stop watching a movie or something because I know something embarrassing is coming up and I don't want to see it.	0
Sharing a room with male higher-up on business trip?	That's absurd. An individual room per person no matter the gender is the only professionally acceptable way. March right up to him right now and say "I will not be sharing a room with you on our trip, that's absurd" OR "I quit, you disgusting pervert." Your choice.	Yeah, no. This can't possibly be right. This HAS to be a misunderstanding. Go see your boss and clarify this. Make sure you make no assumption and no accusation. Just simply state: It looks like you only reserved one room. Should I reserve my own room, or have the plans changed and I'm not going? If he specifically states that he expects the two of you to share one room, tell him in no uncertain terms that you are not comfortable with this and will not share a room with him. If he has a problem with that, go to HR and/or get the hell out of that employment situation.	0
I told my guy friends I hadn't been on a date in 6 years and got a lot of sympathy looks and sighs for it. What is something you've shared with your friends thinking it wasn't a big deal, but they reacted poorly?	Told some housemates in casual conversation that I'm introverted. Wow, they did not take that well and spent forever insisting that I wasn't. It ended up leading to genuine conflict. It was weird.	How is not going on a date in 6 yrs not a big deal? Unless....you dont want to go on dates	1
What fashion trend do you hate and wish would die out?	So just because you don't have a "romper body" you think they should go out of style for everyone else too? That's pretty irrational.	Painted-on eyebrows. Got thick eyebrows? Great, rock 'em. Want to fill yours in a bit? Looks awesome. Painting them on so you can't even tell there's hair... looks a bit too cartoonish for me.	0
Women who had an affair: what did/do you think of the man you cheated on?	You know what, he was really nice. We had a good relationship. He was nice to me, we had fun together, etc. But I didn't love him, and I don't think he loved me. We were more like good friends that had a lot in common and our relationship had no passion. I had no ill thoughts of him, I was just young, naive and bored and I fell in love with someone else and was too immature to understand I owed it to him to wait and be honest rather than going behind his back and acting on it first. It's been damn near a decade, but I still regret it.	I've never cheated and it kind of annoys me when they say "my relationship was falling apart". When my relationships were falling apart, I fixed it and talked through our problems or we broke up. I never resorted to cheating. I just don't get it. I guess I have too much of a conscience.	1
Ladies, did you find your SO physically attractive the first time you saw them?	Only a little bit. He's just your typical tall, lanky guy, so nothing special. I only started dating him because I pitied him a bit...and yet, here I am, two years later, and we're planning to get engaged. The more I talked with him, the more attractive he became. To most of the world though, he's nothing special.	When I first saw him in person, yes. The pictures on his on his dating profile didn't do him justice, though, so before our first date I was kind of on the fence of whether I found him attractive or not.	0
Morning ladies! What's something you do that might sound "crazy" if you said it out loud, but seems totally rational to you?	I spend a lot of time planning hypothetical scenarios, like arguments, people randomly attacking, etc. It keeps me occupied in the shower or if I am in public and I'm bored. Of course, I am a pretty paranoid person, so this may genuinely be crazy, but it has come in handy from time to time	I like to bring tea or coffee into the bathroom when I poop. I'll sit there and drink the warmth in. I am convinced it helps me a little when I am constipated because coffee and tea relax me while I drink them.	1
Are white lies okay in your relationship or do you expect complete transparency?	I would want complete honesty. My SO likes to tell me white lies. And I catch him on it. It drives me insane. I'm not upset but it's annoying. Because we have to have the conversation all over again. Just tell me the truth from the beginning.	Meh. I'm fine with lies about gifts, surprises, or how yummy the meal you prepared wasn't. But even beyond that, I don't expect complete *transparency*. Honesty is fine, but I don't need to know *everything*. I just need to have what you do want to tell me be true.	0
Have you ever had something happen to you (good or bad) that made you rethink your entire personality or identity?	When I learned I had Complex PTSD and what an emotional flashback was I gained a huge insight into my personality. The same was true when I learned what dysphoria was years ago. Now I realize how much both emotional flashbacks from my childhood abuse and the pain from gender dysphoria have "guided" my personality throughout my life since early childhood. I don't think "rethink" is a good word for it. I think "understand" is a better word for it. Knowledge truly is power, and having words for what I am going through and to realize its already been study in depth makes me feel very empowered. I can see better truly who am I outside an emotional flashback, and the varying ways my persona shifts when in an emotional flashback. Fight, flight, freeze, and fawn all display different behaviors with me.	I'd been taking medication/receiving treatment for depression and bipolar disorder for almost 12 years when my psychiatrist suddenly died in 2013. I was unable to find another doctor accepting new patients that took my insurance and I couldn't afford the intake appointment for the ones that didn't. When I ultimately decided I'd just see what happened if I stopped taking anything, I realized I had no idea what I was like without it. I ***definitely do not*** recommend doing this, as it could have ended extremely poorly, but it ended up being very positive for me.	0
My fellow pad wearers- are you sick of other ladies telling you that you need to use some other kind of period protection? Just me?	It's likely that they think poorly of pads because they haven't tried many. They probably only had experience with those disgusting and terrible disposable ones, that come unstuck from the underwear and get stuck to the thighs, pants, and pubic hair, and also always smell terrible. They probably haven't tried the cloth pads that are fleece-lined, have have a charcoal layer, and fasten with a clip, or the panties that have pads built right in. That said, if you can feel your diva cup, you're probably doing something very wrong. A lot of people don't read the directions.	Yes! I've had so many women tease me about wearing a pad,some of them calling me a "grandma" or making jokes about how I must not be able to take a dick. So now I have some pads in my car and my purse at all times so I never have to ask anyone if they have one. EDIT: Wow so many replies! You guys are all so sweet. Just wanted to say,that dick comment came from a drunk girl at a bar so it wasn't really that big of a deal but still,very rude. And yes,people are ignorant and feel like they have the right to comment of your personal preferences but like I said I just keep my pads on me at all times so I never have to listen to another stupid remark.	0
What is the difference between your salary and your partner's? How does it affect your relationship if at all?	The guy I'm seeing right now makes A LOT more money than I do, but also lives in a more expensive city so it's not as bad of a difference. He always wants to pay for things and most of the time doesn't let me pay him back or split it. I guess that's his choice but I feel like I'm taking advantage of his money, even though he says I'm not.	My fiance makes about double what I make. I'm super happy for him because he enjoys what he does. I felt the same about his job when he was making half that much. I will say that with a caveat though because if you're not married and the difference is huge, it could potentially cause problems. Not too long ago, I was a broke college student that could barely afford rent while he was already working successfully and making a decent salary. I felt badly often because he wanted to go out on dates and spending $20 to me was a big deal. He offered to pay always but it still didn't make me feel very good about myself.	1
Sex with your skirt on, hot or not?	Hot as long as the clothing isn't damaged. I'm all for being spontaneous and having a quickie, but if he rips/tears/damages my clothes then I get cranky.	I'm a guy and going to answer. It's my number 1 fantasy and works in so many scenarios. Like we're both at home, she is doing something on the kitchen counter, I bend her over, get frisky Or at work with a co-worker, or at school.	1
Alright Ladies - What is on your list of red flags to look for on the first few dates?	Not respecting small boundaries I set and being rude to servers and baristas are big ones for me. If they push me on small boundaries, I expect the same on important ones.	How he speaks to the waitress at dinner. If he is polite and leaves a good tip, good sign. Ask him to defend his favorite song. Purposely disagree and see how he argues. I love doing this.	1
Men here on AskWomen, has browsing this sub changed your views?	Yes. Probably the most important I realized is that every woman has different preferences, so whatever insecurities I have that I can't change doesn't really matter. I just need to be the best I can be and hope someone out there likes my particular combination.	In a way yes, I thought I held feminist views until I started following this and other female orientated subs. Now I reject "feminism" and prefer the term egalitarian.	1
Have you ever been forbidden or discouraged from doing something because "girls don't [fill in the blank]"?	When I was eight I really wanted to grow a beard. A big Santa beard! I told my mom about my aspirations, and she told me I couldn't since I was a girl. I was devastated, and thought she meant that I wasn't allowed to, not that I physically was unable. That's all I have. My mom and dad were pretty accepting and thought my brothers and I should learn things equally.	*Women don't shoot themselves.* Only a woman who had so completely lost any sense of self, gone absolutely crazy, would just a gun to take her own life because *A woman wouldn't leave such a mess for someone to find.* She was suffering from life-shattering delusions, and her gender didn't change how she felt. **Suicide is suicide, no matter the gender of the person.**	1
Ladies, what's your greatest Liz Lemon moment?	When I worked a terrible stressful job with ridiculous overtime I once came home, got into a bath, and ate hummus.	I had a guy ask me, in the course of a conversation, if I was single. My response was to rant about how I didn't need a man and people need to get off my ass for being single. He was trying to ask me out.	0
Is it rude to presume a gift will be given at a Renewal of Vows, and to specifically ask for cash because you "have it all"?	Yes. Super presumptuous. I would not in a million years bring a gift to a vow renewal, and the assumption of getting one would be insane to me. I can see certain guests bringing them because hey, event, let's be nice to our friends, but.. to assume that everyone's gonna bring one and hey actually guys, just money will do? That is some *craziness*.	I'll repost my answer... I don't think there's anything wrong with that. People have birthdays every year and other still tend to buy them presents... So I don't think expecting that some people would give "second wedding" gifts.	1
How often do you orgasm simultaneously with whomever you're having sex with?	Pretty much never, my current partner and I have been together for 2+ years and I think it has happened twice? Those times were amazing but I don't really get off from piv, so it's just not expected.	I'd put it at 95%+ of the time. My orgasm is almost entirely controlled by hers, I have a very hard time getting off during sex if she doesn't orgasm at the same time. Thankfully there's plenty of opportunity since she is multi-orgasmic.	1
What are subtle signs that someone isn't a good partner?	Anybody can be partners with anyone else. Partners aren't just bad in the sense that a tomato is bad past it's expiration date. There are layers to people and this is really just an incredibly immoral question at worst, and ignorant at best. Diverse people means diverse needs in a relationship. There's also the evolution of a relationship where people grow from the needs of each other. Don't just blanket this under the sense of a "normal guy". No one is normal and we are all flawed in one way or another. I'm sorry to rant but the point of view that this question even comes from is intolerance.	Always feeling like you have to apologize for them and their behavior at social events. Happened a lot with one of my exes, I feel like I had a mental block about it.	0
How old are you and what is the biggest struggle in your life right now?	28 (29 in a month) here. Right now, it's that my husband and I have been not-trying (ie: not actively preventing) to get pregnant for two years now with no luck and it's really starting to wear on me. His younger sister just announced that she's having a baby in April. I'm happy for her but it also reminds me of how much I want it and how scared I am that I can't...	I am 61. I quit working several years ago to take care of my MIL until she died. Then took care of my own mother until she died. Now am stay at home housewife trying to find purpose and relevance for the next stage of my life. I have all the time in the world and no idea what to do with any of it. Not true- I have hobbies and things I enjoy doing. I'm just at a bit of a crossroads right now and having difficulty adjusting to not being needed as much any more. Husband is wonderful but I am alone a lot. First world problem to be sure.	0
What are some things you would tell the 14 year old version of yourself?	JFC stop eating so goddamn much. You're better than this. It'll save you a lot of bullying and heartache later. You're objectively attractive and you've spent your childhood thinking you're destined to be the ugly fat friend who will never find love. Don't date anyone until you meet your future husband, or at least don't date these specific people. Work harder in school and at least go to community college, dad offered to pay for it but you were so busy goofing off that you never went. It's okay to question religion. It's okay to question sexuality. Also, here are the sports results for the next 13 years. You know what to do.	You have all the power to you in the world. Focus even further on robotics, do FRC earlier. Be more of a leader in robotics, go get the Gavels you deserved in MUN. Don't worry about the girls that laughed at you and teased you and were mean to you because they didn't like you. Commit yourself to mathematics and CS. No reason you shouldn't have gotten a 7 on the Math HL exam. Or the CS HL Exam. Or the Chem HL exam. You want to go to MIT. Stay Salty, and stay hungry. Yes HS was easy, but you can't stay complacent.	1
I'm a man who never approaches women because I don't want to seem like I just want to get them in to bed. What says to you that a man is just being friendly and not looking for something more?	Why are you bending over backwards just so that no random woman thinks you're trying to get laid? (Nothing wrong with that by the way). Just be your self and if that's "creepy" to her, move along and talk to someone more deserving of your time	I have had many rewarding and interesting conversations with men I don't know, and the thing that all of those conversations have in common is that the guy never brought up my appearance or complimented me on something physical. In a museum, taking about the artists in the current exhibit; at a fundraising event talking about why we were there and why it was important; in a particularly long queue, talking about the weather and how ski season should be coming up soon, and hey! wouldn't you know we both snowboard. Those are all examples of recent conversations I've had with men I didn't know that have been pleasant and didn't trigger the feeling that I was being sussed out as a sex partner.	0
Have you ever met someone who had little to no self-awareness?	I work with someone who not only *can not* shut up but is completely unaware of how much time passes while she is yammering away. She really thinks that time just stops and never understands why she can't finish things during her shift because, in her head, she was always busy. To be fair, she is part time and spends most of the day at home with a three-year-old so I can kind of understand the dam burst that happens when she is around adults again. I'm just tired of cleaning up after her.	I know someone who thinks they're better than everyone else because they don't drink or smoke...but they have never done anything with their life, nor even graduated high school. This person is ignorant child who acts like their due their respect, but doesn't respect anyone else.	1
If make-up became mainstream for men, what new beauty norms would you expect/want to see for men?	I'd love to see better skincare all around, not really makeup. Sunscreen and some foot lotion could make such a difference.	I'd hate to see that happen. I don't find makeup appealing for either gender, and it would suck if men started to feel like they had to wear it.	1
How can I deal with being ugly?	Start dressing for yourself and not in ways that you think will be pleasing to others. Find outfits that you personally just adore regardless of what others might think of your appearance. Wanna try some fun new mapeup? Dont wanna wear any at all? Do what feels right. The resulting confidence will make you feel better/happier and actually make you more attractive to other people. Sounds cliché, but clichés exist for a reason.	I think the fact you were able to post this and try to take a step at self improvement is beautiful in and of itself.	1
Any other Canadian women excited by our new Cabinet having 50% women for the first time in our history?	I'm very excited about the women and First Nations in the Cabinet. One of the MPs from my province (B.C) is a FN woman (Jody Wilson-Raybould) with an amazing background, who I'm very hopeful about specifically.	What people SHOULD be excited for is having the best people for the job. Picking 50/50 just to say you have equal half men and half women is irresponsible. I want the best people on the job. Whether thats 100% men, 100% women or any split in between I don't care I just want this country fixed and prospering again	1
What are your bad breakup stories?	Geesh, a lot of these stories involve cheating and obsession. I hope you ladies don't generalize most men to be this way!	I broke up with him, he cried, wouldn't leave, proposed, then would turn up at my place randomly *for a year* asking me to marry him/suck his dick.	0
Do you ever inform people "I HAVE A BOYFRIEND" when they ask you polite questions?	I have a friend who likes to say to managers "Hey, X did a good job helping me today" whenever we're out (even if they didn't really do anything at all), so he always asks workers what their name is. Women workers respond "I have a boyfriend" about 50% of the time. It's always awkward.	It's such a double edged sword. I don't yell "I HAVE A BOYFRIEND" in someone's face if I'm having a conversation with them. But if I'm at a party conversing with a guy, I might casually slip in "oh yeah my boyfriend told me about that" or something along those lines. My friend on the other hand HATES doing that so she's been called a tease a fair amount of times. It's to the point that I feel like I can't make have a conversation at a party with a guy without feeling guilty.	0
What's the worst thing your (ex)SO has ever said to you, and did your relationship recover?	We were watching Love Actually and he said that he identifies most with the story of the guy who's in love with his best friend's new wife, because he still loves this friend from high school even though she's married now and he's happy with me. He was drunk at the time, and we all have our pasts, so I'm not too upset about it. I don't think he'd cheat on me, even had he the opportunity, but it does make me sad sometimes. And I can't watch Love Actually any more.	Our biggest argument of the relationship. She swears I had an old iPod classic when I had my truck but that old iPod died long before I ever got my truck and I upgraded to an iPod touch. The relationship has recovered from that and I love her dearly.	1
Is anyone exhausted by the constant maintenance and grooming 'required' to look and feel good?	First of all, multivitamins don't really do shit. Your body can only process so much, and the rest is just clogging up your liver. As for the beauty routine, I feel like that's something that should make you feel pampered, not feel like a chore! I don't wear makeup and I wax a handful of times a year, and I definitely do not feel not put together. The best thing you can do for feeling fresh and awesome is give your body some daily exercise. There's absolutely no need for all this other crap on top of it to be beautiful.	I go through periods of feeling disillusioned with it all. Then I get lazy and stop doing some things. A week later I realise that my legs are itchy from being unshaven dry from not being moisturized, and I don't want to touch my hair because it's been over a week since I washed it. Then I regret my laziness and start up again. It's a never ending cycle. Most of my routine is for ongoing comfort, so I try to keep that in mind.	0
Do you have any non-standard 'rules' for your relationship?	If either of us makes a kissy sound, we have to drop what we're doing and kiss. The other person has to come to the person who made the sound (so it's a good way to lure someone to bed...). Even if we're mad at each either, or tired, or stressed, or busy. We didn't really explicitly set this rule out but we started doing it and it's like an unspoken rule between us. It's a tool.	I guess this isn't a rule for a specific relationship, but my girlfriends and I (most of us are kind of dating around, just having fun) have made a pact that none of us are allowed to date a guy whose favorite tv show is South Park, Family Guy, or another similar "adult" animation.	1
Do you behave less friendly to men after having experiences of them taking it as a sign of interest?	100% yes. I'm a pretty bubbly person, but smiling, eye contact, friendliness, and compliments have all been interpreted as a sign of interest. I'm still a friendly person, but I've learned to be more aloof and standoffish out of necessity. I think I might have resting nice face.	No. I'm friendly and nice and like being that way. I don't approach people but with classmates, acquaintances, friends of friends, delivery people, strangers that are being nice, etc. I act friendly and nice (especially as I'm overcoming my social anxiety). Unless 100% of the men I encountered took it as a sign of interest, I wouldn't change my ways. It's who I am.	1
Does anyone else keep buying nail polish but hardly ever use any?	Yes, of course, there's always that chance I'll HAVE to paint my nails a horrendous burnt orange. I have more nail polish than I care to admit..	I don't buy anything I'm not going to use, if I find an item that I haven't used in a certain time period (Depends on item, nail polish would be like 4 months) I donate or throw it away. Rarely happens though.	1
Does anyone else ever feel "responsible" if their friends aren't having fun at something they chose to do/didn't like the food at a restaurant they chose, etc?	Part of me knows I shouldn't take it so personally. The other part of me thinks they should know it is rude and not complain about an activity I chose. Worse than friends, my ex used to do this. Ugh. He complained about my indecisiveness and complained when I did choose a place. Ass hole.	No, not really. Not everyone is going to like the same stuff. I'd apologize, suggest we could do something else, or insist that they choose the next activity/food place/whatever.	1
Which monthly subscription services do you use and are they worth it?	I subscribe both to ipsy & birchbox, is it worth it? It can be hit or miss but I do feel for only 10$ each I get my $$ worth, ipsy is more makeup geared where as birchbox has more of a selection of skin care and hair care. What I've been trying to do with the excess bags/products I don't like is throw some tampons/panty liners in the ipsy bags with some makeup products I've received (and haven't used) and bring them to my local shelter for women.	I just subscribed to two pet boxes...can't say yet if they're worth it though based on the reviews, one is okay and the other is really good. I bought both on groupon though lol (save20 ! for extra 20% off locals lol!) so a $25 box is actually only costing me $8.99 right now. I've used them in the past and while a good value, I usually cancel after. I only like to subscribe to them when I can get the boxes at an extra low rate lol. I recognize that the items are already cheaper because they're bundled into a "mystery" box, but still lol.	1
Married women of AW, what are the hardest/toughest parts of marriage?	The toughest part for me is only getting to have sex with one man for the rest of my life. I suppose I could cheat, but that involves effort and lying and I just don't have the time or the patience to deal with potential drama. I do have an excellent vibrator though, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.	* In-laws * Children * Division of household labor / chores * One partner getting laid off / unemployed for a long time * Budgeting finances * One partner getting a job offer in a different state / country * Coping with physical / mental health issues * Agreeing upon parenting styles	0
How old are you, and what's something you recently learned about yourself?	27, and I learned two weeks ago that I'm gooey! I probably have been my whole life, but only realised now. Edit: I meant "gaaaaay" lol, but I'm keeping gooey	I'm 21 and I recently learned that I'm far too involved in my job and my hobbies and myself to ever be suitable for a relationship.	1
How well suited would you be to life as a vampire?	I fucking love garlic. Can I consume my human blood while I'm an animal? Morally I would have trouble killing another human being, but I wouldn't mind sneaking into a blood bank or something and having my 25% there. Humans usually die if they lose around 2L of blood, so my 25% would only be 500mL which is only stealing one bag a week. I know blood supply is short, but I guess it's better than actually killing someone. Besides the garlic love and the killing part, I think I'd manage okay.	I have really bad seasonal depression, so I would be the mopiest, emotional vampire ever. Think twilight but so much whinier. Can I take vitamin D supplements as a vampire?	1
Ladies in interracial relationships, have you gotten any backlash from family/society in general?	White guy here, but married to an Asian woman. Been together 20 years and I can honestly say it has never even been mentioned, much less been an issue.	I'm a white woman married to an Arab man. Don't even get me started. "Does he make you cover up/cook/stay at home? Does his family accept you? So are you... muslim...? Are you allowed to do X?" My husband is an atheist. If my dad had still been alive he would have given me no end of shit for it. He was mega racist. Thankfully since he's dead that is not an issue and all my other family don't see it as an issue to bring up in the first place.	0
Lesbians how much flannel do you own?	I'm a gold star lesbian, meaning I've had no sexual contact nor have I made out with a male. Though I did once kiss a boy on the playground when I was younger. I digress. I own zero flannel, and zero plaid. I've got short hair, dress like a tomboy, and own tons of beanies. I also dislike Tegan and Sara so I'm pretty much not following the lesbian rulebook aside from lusting after and having sex with females.	Queer Floridian and it is way too hot here for flannel. Sports jerseys seem to be the gay girl uniform here, and I don't own any because I hate sports.	0
Is it just me, or is any other Lady out there annoyed with men doing the whole "demand" or "beck-and-call" style dating behavior?	I think that there is a fine line with this. If you already have a built familiarity with the other person, I don't see a problem. It could seem more enthusiastic and fun to just say "get in loser, we're going shopping!" However, if someone I barely knew or had just met came up to me and said something along the lines of "We are going on a date Friday. Be there at 8." without really establishing that you're someone I'd want to spend time with.... Well, that's not very cool.	Ok, maybe it's only me, but most of the girls I'm involved with know that I'm only joking when I say stuff like that. Like I will first ask "Are you busy? Wanna come over and hang/go out tonight?" and if she says "No, I'm busy with dinner with my family" or w/e I'll joke around and say the whole "nah, ditch dinner with your fam." I only use this if I know the person and she knows me, cause I say stuff like that all the time but never seriously. I can't imagine people actually saying rude shit like that seriously.	1
What's your most cynical opinion on dating/relationships?	My cynical opinion is usually about my own relationships. I'm waiting for the day my SO moves on to someone better than me. It's inevitable.	If you're dating a person, and they realize they don't see it going anywhere and break it off, get the hell over it.	1
Women (and men) of AW, have you ever been stalked on Reddit?	I had posted a pic of a new tattoo on Reddit once. A user made a comment, and some other user said "here you go" and had found and posted my cell number.	Yep, I've had people go through my history and downvote pages of comments. I actually don't read my PMs at all, because soon after I joined Reddit it became obvious that users saw them as a way to harass me. (I get targeted primarily because I openly identify myself as both a healthy-living fat person and as a health-studies researcher, and I often intervene in Reddit discussions that disseminate false information about fat people, lifestyles, and health. The anti-fat trolls on Reddit are *really* dedicated to shouting down any negation of their "fat is unhealthy" and "calories in, calories out" myths by actual science.)	1
Who is hotter: Aragorn or Legolas?	This was on a buzzfeed quiz!! my boyfriend and I got into a tiny fight over it because I think Aragorn is hotter and he thinks Legolas is hotter	Aragorn. That introduction scene in the Prancing Pony where you just see his eyes under the hood is *swelteringly* hot.	0
What tiny thing annoys you but you can't rant about it to your friends?	The spread of misinformation on social media is probably my biggest pet peeve. People will learn something from one source and panic a ton of their friends without ever even bothering to do a little more research, see what official news sources say, or reading past the headline in general. Absolutely cannot stand it. I feel the need to fact check for people but I'm sure I'd be just as annoying in return. I can't rant about it to my friends because it happens every fucking day and they'd get sick of it.. Also I can't figure out why I care that some acquaintance I seldom talk to and all their gullible friends are misinformed. **Edit:** Also guess what it's almost 2016 and as it turns, west coasters DON'T all have radiation sickness/cancer from Fukushima. So glad half my Facebook friends *"vowed"* to move east to avoid the Fukupocalypse.	"He or she deleted me on [Social Media Site]" no they didn't the unfriended you. You were not deleted. Deleting implies destruction of data.	1
What's everybody buying their SO for Christmas??	Eh, we don't really do Christmas gifts. Christmas is stressful and terrible enough without having to add another dimension to it. Our gifts to each other are trying to save one another from stress!	I'm a HUGE reader, but my boyfriend really isn't too into reading. But we're LDR, and whenever we visit each other he loves to listen to me read out loud, so I've slowly been introducing him to all my favorite books. For Christmas, I've been making a few audiobooks by recording myself reading, for him to listen to while we're apart! A super cheap gift, but I've been investing a lot of time, and I hope it's going to mean a lot to him :)	0
What do you consider the top 5 biggest stereotypes made by men towards women?	Online: 1. Alpha FUX beta BUX. 2. Gold diggers. 3. Feminazis. 4. Women get laid way easier than guys. 5. Women are irrational. In real life the stereotypes I encounter aren't as farfetched but maybe that's because of the people I encounter on a regular basis.	I'm too lazy to list five things, but I am really tired of hearing that all women care about is money. Like, no. We don't all max out our credit cards on Gucci and expect a man to pay it off for us.	0
Have any of you ladies ever gotten an STD? What happened?	Yes I was young and naive. Chlamydia twice from the same guy. First time I took the pills and got some for him as well. Second time I did not get any pills for him, I told him, and then I left him.	I have herpes. I got it from a one night stand. We didn't use a condom because I was heavily intoxicated and dumb. I've only had one outbreak and I've been tested for everything else and I'm clean. Maybe the reason I am okay about it is because I know it could have been much worse. I could have gotten HIV. Herpes isn't bad at all. I've had the one outbreak and never another. I disclosed to all my other partners and they did not give a shit. Granted, I got it in Germany and in Europe herpes is a lot less stigmatized. No one really cares. My current bf got it from me despite us being cautious and I felt bad but he doesn't seem to care. He'd rather not use condoms and risk herpes than use condoms. *shrugs*	1
When you first met your SO, were you instantly attracted to them, or did it just develop over time? How do relationships normally happen?	Saw my SO in first day of College, was like dayum. We were friends for like 3 years, now we're dating. Now I'm still like dayum whenever I see him.	We started dating because a mutual friend told me that he was interested. At first I was not attracted to him but I decided to give it a shot because my friend told me he was such a nice guy. It wasn't love at first sight nor love at first date, but I felt comfortable around him and every time we hang out I discovered a new aspect of his personality that I liked. He turned out to be a very sweet, compassionate and respectful guy. We complement each other in so many ways. I started to become attracted to him more and more every moment we spent together. We've been dating for more than a year now and I couldn't be happier! Even though I wasn't attracted to him when I first met him, now he is the most handsome man in the world to me.	1
I've eaten Chipotle 5 out of the last 7 days. What objectively embarrassing accomplishment are you proud of right now?	I figured out if you pour PBR into a ginger ale bottle, it looks just like ginger ale. It makes day drinking in public a breeze. College student.	I've been eating totally natural/fresh foods for almost a month, and then I ate Chinese food and got sick. I kind of see this as an accomplishment because my cravings for fast food/heavily processed food are pretty much gone at this point. I actually crave healthy/fresh foods now instead of just forcing myself to eat them because I should.	1
Anyone got a breast lift? Was it worth it?	I personally do not, but have a close friend who has. Her situation was similar to your own. Young, no kids, yet already deflated breasts. She got a lift with implants and absolutely loved them. No sensation loss in nipples. She said she would definitely do it again. Best of luck!	If you want breast lift *with* implants, I take it as your breasts are not too large. If you have average-sized or slightly big breasts and they're on the saggy side, you can actually lift them up with some exercises. While I haven't seen an example myself, a personal trainer had said you can ever make your breasts appear one cup size bigger by gaining some muscles on the chest area.	1
Does Porn ever depress you?	No not really. For some reason the semi-degrading forceful ish nature of mainstream porn turns me on. Revenge porn and the industries strange practices **Trigger warning** I have personally watched a "gangbang" video where the woman was clearly on a lot of drugs (was semi-unresponsive seemed to have a very high pain threshold and had poor skin condition etc etc) and was filmed with one camera in what looked like a basement on a single dirty mattress. I reported it but nothing came from it. **Trigger over** While I personally don't feel strongly either way about consensual domination seeing it seems to turn me on for some reason...	Cunnilingus is no where to be found, and when you do find it, it lasts like 15 seconds at most. The remaining 15 minutes of the video will be dedicated to a blowjob. I get depressed when I look for the most basic of acts dedicated to women's pleasure and can't find any.	0
Living with my best friend just turned into a nightmare. Tell me your roommate horror stories?	I had an awful male roommate for a while. He refused to pay his part of any bills and constantly ate my food. He tried to convert me to christianity constantly (I grew up christian, but I'm agnostic). That was bad enough, but then he started getting creepy. My panties started going missing. He ate my food, even when I told him not to. Then one day I came home and went to do yoga, and stepped in cum. He had cum on my yoga mat. I lost it. He was evicted shortly after that. I found all my missing panties, crusty, behind his bed.	I had a roommate who was a DJ (I'm sure you can fill in the rest) Additionally: He slept all day and spent the nights watching movies on his speakers (for some reason he REALLY liked Django Unchained and Drinking Buddies) Bonus: one weekend (I usually went home for the weekend but instead went to a friend's house and came back the next day) I found that he ate MY FOOD in MY BOWL and hadn't bothered to clean it. :/	1
What are some of the biggest mistakes you think your male friends make regarding dating/relationships?	This isn't romantic, but my male housemate constantly complains about my female housemate being passive aggressive. Only to me. Never to my female housemate. He just silently resents her until it builds into rage. He somehow doesn't understand that him never ever complaining about things that bother him is not, in fact, her being passive aggressive; it's just her having no idea that he's ticked off because HE is passive aggressive.	meanwhile I have more in common with my mom's 60 year old clients than any girl I've met my age (26). No girl I hang out with would ever want to go see the gallery of Winston Churchill's paintings, talk about Andrew Roberts, or visit the special exhibit on Prohibition	1
What's the worst place or context you've been hit on?	I was a waitress. Guy came in with two little boys. Proceeded to hit on me throughout the entire time he was there and then was like "you don't happen to have daddy issues by any chance?" The next week he came back with his wife...	I always get hit on by the 12 year olds riding their bikes on my street. I'm very popular with young black boys, I think it's adorable and shows good confidence. They're always so polite too.	1
What tropes in female characters annoy you?	The thing that annoys me more than anything else is when there is this badass female action hero character who does amazing feats of strength that I could never do, played by an actress with biceps the size of her wrists. Like, Gregor Clegane is played by a professional strongman champion, but Brienne of Tarth is a runway model. Just the idea that women are allowed to be strong, but they still have to look sexy and traditionally feminine. It's like "OK, sure we'll put her in this movie, but you know this is completely fantasy, and real women can't actually do this without elf magic, right?"	She's a wildly successful woman- a great job, great education, great apartment, great friends, great wardrobe, great car, but boy howdy, is she just a mess with men! When she gets near anything with a penis, she just cannot handle being a normal person!	0
Women in long term relationships, do you have days when you feel super in love with your partner?	I don't know if you call 3 years long ( we're living together for 2 years now), but I definitely know that. Some days I'm worried because we arent that 'sticky-loveing' couple anymore, but then we go out and people ask us how long we''ve been together '3 years' 'wow- I did not expected that, you guys look SO in love', so that's awesome.	Definitely. I mean, I'm always in love with him, but some days I want to physically cling to him, give him a billion kisses all over, cook for him, give him everything he wants, and sex him simply because I love him and express it to him by making him as satisfied/happy as possible.	0
Divorced Women of Reddit, What Are Some Things You Wish You Knew Before You Got Married?	I wish we'd been through a big fight. We didn't know how to disagree and go on. I just congratulated myself on how we never fought.	When you're dating, start a red-flags list on each guy. Do a lot of detached analysis before allowing yourself to get emotionally involved or making a commitment. Don't be desperate.	1
Do you ever feel like adult relationships are kind of...depressing?	I think adult relationships are awesome. As a teenager, they're about being cute and having fun and god forbid your boyfriend ever catch you with morning breath and messy hair. In an adult relationship, he's my partner, in every sense of the word. We've seen each other at our absolute worst, and we've worked our asses off to be the best we can be for ourselves as well as for one another. Adult relationships require a lot more, and they're far more fulfilling.	Sort of. At least partially part of the reason I haven't bothered and have no experience with them. At times I think with all I plan to do and accomplish, and how busy my life is now, I'd rather not complicate it more with another person's feelings, thoughts, and desires. It's hard enough with my own.	1
Have you ever been served something disgusting but felt compelled to eat it (meeting SOs parents, business dinner, etc.)? If so, what was the offending food and how did you deal with it?	went to thanksgiving with a friend i had a crush on. her mother was kind of wacky and crazy and she made this dish that she was bragging about all day and insisted everyone take a GIANT spoonful of, while she watched them. the dish? apricots and pureed sweet potatoes baked with cilantro, nuts, pepper, and sugar, in a big casserole dish covered with shredded cheddar. ... horrible.	I'm a super picky eater. I was at this nice restaurant and they had a special 4 course menu for the week and it was really cheap. I was really broke, and everyone else was going with that and talking about how they were gonna pick different things and share. So I went with it... I thought it would be ok. It wasn't. I didn't like any of it. I'm sure the food would have been amazing for someone who wasn't picky, but I am! Luckily, I felt bad and blamed not eating everything on the fact that I didn't feel good... but man. And then to make matters worse, my sweet friend paid for mine because he knew I was broke. I felt so bad after that.	1
What is your favorite standup available on Netflix?	If you're into strange humor and awkward delivery Eugene Mirman (voice of Gene from Bob's Burgers) has a standup out. Also, a lot of Bob's Burgers is on Netflix, if not all of it.	Aziz Ansari. Almost everyone else is either a white guy making fun of women or minorities, or a woman or person of color making white people feel comfortable laughing at them.	1
Adults of r/askwomen: how did you decide which town/city to settle in?	I'm opting for a house in the country rather than the city. I require peace, quiet, hiking, and gardening. 💮	This question seems adorably naive. It's like no one her is below upper middle class or something. Most people decided where to live based on where they already lived and where they could get a job. Or where they married someone that already lives somewhere. Most people don't decide to live much of anywhere, where they were born dictates it.	1
What's the worst gift you have received from an in-law?	* Meal replacement bars and diet pills * Bill O'Reilly book "Culture Warrior" * Underwear from the children's department * Sweatshirt with airbrushed dolphins and the word HAWAII in a rainbow (I've never been) * Sweater three sizes too large because "I told the sales lady you had very large breasts and she recommended this."	A Stephanie Plum novel. Great well intentioned idea as they knew I love reading but dear God was that book terrible. Also, the first year, my boyfriend told me they would send me chocolate for Christmas so I was surprised to unwrap a shower gel. All the other ones have been awesome though.	1
Asian women of /askwomen, have you ever encountered men that want to date you purely because you're Asian?	A fellow on OkCupid recently said to me that it's "that's neat that you are of Chinese origin. I don't know why but I've always wanted to be intimate with a Chinese woman, hehe" It makes me uncomfortable because it makes me feel like he expects that I'll have some defining Chinese characteristics.	Just saying, I've been fetishized as a white man a few times by Asian women. It's a two way street.	1
What was the "last straw" in your past relationship for you?	After years of neglect, I cheated on him. I cut things off once I realized how horrible I was. I came clean after I caught him cheating on me. We agreed we'd work on things. Caught him still talking to her after we had had a big blow up about the 6 years of a passionless marriage. I noped out of that marriage leaving almost everything I owned behind. It wasn't even the cheating. How could I be mad about something I'd also done? It was the lying.	we were together 5 years. he broke his arm the same week my mom committed suicide. our relationship had been falling apart the last year anyway, but he told me I "hadn't been there enough for him since his injury" and I needed to "move on and get over it already." my mother hadn't even been cremated yet.🙁 I moved out that day and left the majority of my shit there. it was hard considering I paid for the place mostly, but I had to go.	0
My pug barfed and my Roomba tracked it all over the room. Ladies, how have your loved ones let you down today?	my kitty puked up his breakfast all over my roommate's clothes and i didn't notice it until i was running out the door to work so i had to leave it there.	My dog is an excited pee-er. Or maybe a submissive pee-er. I'm not sure. We were told by our vet that it's pretty normal for pitbulls and he's barely a year old, so he'll probably grow out of it. Still, when the first thing you're greeted by when you come home is a leg covered in pee, it gets pretty tiring. He's perfectly house and crate trained, and he tends to be okay with my mom and sister who live with him full time. But when I come home to visit I always get peed on.	0
Toilet paper that doesn't leave "souvenirs"?	I use cloth for pee. That sounds weird to most people (and it did to me too before I tried it), but now I LOVE it. I cut up a pair of old flannel sheets into little squares, I use the square, then I toss it in the laundry.	Honestly I find that cheap toilet paper is the best for this. As shitty as the stuff is in public stalls, it never gives me clitty litter. Edit: something something can't believe I got gilded for a comment about toilet paper. Thanks, /u/lordvadr!	0
Have you ever lost attraction to an SO, for reasons that were out of their control?	The first part of the relationship was great. He's hilarious, spontaneous, smart, and fun. But once we had dated for a few months I realized he didn't know how to relax. In our relationship or just in life. He didn't know how to hang out. If he came over, I had to be "on" the whole time, entertaining him. If I didn't have a plan for the day or just wanted to chill, he would suddenly remember all the things on his to-do list, start making excuses, and leave. He was great at parties, but the lack of one-on-one time made me feel really distanced from him. So my brain started reassessing and my attraction took a nose dive. I still think he's an amazing person though. We just weren't great for each other.	What are some examples of reasons out of their control? (Just want to make sure I am understanding the question as intended)	1
What's something gross/unappealing about you, that any future/current SO HAVE to accept about you?	I pick my nose and hate doing dishes. Also my bedroom is constantly full of clothes, it's not gross or moldy food or used tissues or anything just, clothes everywhere. Oh, and I don't brush my teeth. Everyone in my family does and theirs are FALLING OUT and awful. Mine are a bit yellowed but otherwise perfectly healthy with 0 cavities in over a decade.	I have ingrown hairs all over my legs, so they're always filled with small red spots. I've had them since I was like ten and no amount of exfoliating will get rid of them :( But oh well, I'll still wear shorts because life's too short!	0
How many women who've had abortions would still have found a way to have one even if they were illegal?	This question is like many other times I have thought of women in the past. I would have done whatever I needed to do to make it happen. I would have been locked up and key tossed away, I would have been such the troubled maker. I only know this because I'm getting in trouble in this day and age! As my Doctor was telling me a semi no on something I was thinking to myself, Uhg, I hate being a good person because I could so get what I want by this way or that. Really though, I'm not a good person, I just happen to fear prison.	Maybe only the poorest women wouldn't, in my opinion, find a way. And even then, those women might try the most unsafe and harmful of options. If it were illegal for me to get an abortion, I have money that can pay for travel and a discreet doctor. If I didn't have money, I would harm myself and use known household methods. If that failed, I'd do anything to get myself beaten up and hope that would do it. There's always a way, and it depends on how much info you can get and how brave (I guess that's not the best word?) you are to go through with using the particular method.	0
AskWomen, what's your favorite way to live frugally?	I live in a tiny apartment. It's 460 square feet. I could afford something bigger, but why should I? For just me, it's got enough room for my stuff - plus, it's less space to clean!	I don't live frugally, I spend all my money and I own a credit card. It's dangerous. But I do attempt to look for all the specials, when I shop online I go to the sale section and scroll each page about 10 times. I do attempt to avoid full priced items if I can. I like to get more for my buck yanno?	1
On average, how unsafe do you feel around random guys?	Mostly I feel pretty safe. But you bet your ass I never give my number to strangers. That's a rookie mistake.	I don't trust any men ever. Even ones I've known for years because they often act trashy whenever they can. I have had a LOT of bad experiences with men (I mean a looooottt) so I am polite at first but cautious always.	1
What's the best way to use Tinder?	i've just started dating a guy i met off tinder. previously used it just for hook-ups. its whatever you want it to be really. i ignored all pick-up lines but some guys say they work for them so i dunno. pictures where you look hot are typically the best.	Group pictures where one cannot tell which one is you ARE THE WORST. Also posing next to an attractive friend. It's pretty bad when you swipe right for the friend... awkward. Try and talk to them, but not too much - actually make plans to meet and have that organic connection in person. Also, know what you want and stick to it. Hookup? Great! Not hookup? Great! If you're just seeing where things go, great, but don't lead people on. That's not nice. Just be clear and communicate that to the other person.	0
To those that have lived both in and out of the US, what cultural practices do you wish were more common in the states?	I'll explain with a story: I spent a summer in Valencia, Spain. I went to a bar often with a handful of Americans. We were leaving the country and wanted to go to the bar on our last night. We get there and it's closing early so the owner can start his summer vacation. One hot-shot I was with was like, *keep it open and we'll buy double what you make in a single night.* The guy had money to burn. The bar owner looked at him like he was crazy. He basically said, *no amount of money will keep me from starting my vacation, you crazy American.*	Things I wish on the US: politeness, the time taken to just be a tiny bit formal and make sure you say hello and how are you doing before you ask (ask, *not demand* - please and thank you!) for what you're after. The right of hospitality - like someone here mentioned for Scotland, this is common in most other countries: you're a visitor, you get a drink. Not offered, not wait to be asked, it's there and it's yours. Same goes for food. And finally, the right to just drop in on people, without having to call ahead and schedule something that fits into their timetables *and* yours and maybe just putting it off entirely because who wants the hassle? I didn't ever find something in US culture that I wanted to export to other countries.	1
Ladies, what weird or gross shortcuts do you employ when getting ready in the morning?	Do women have the same rule as most of my dude friends: if the jeans do not have stains on them, the jeans are not dirty?	Most of these aren't gross at all. Especially the hair washing. Its good to wash weekly or less for most people if it's not full of products (oily haired individuals may adjust to less frequent washing after a couple of weeks). If dry shampoo was that gross, why do they sell it? I maintain that peeing in the shower is disgusting, but it's not that far out there...	1
Do you ever have moments when you look at your SO and think….DAMN I love this person?	Regularly. One time I was super high, and kept going on and on about how cute her teeth and knee caps are...? I don't even know.	ugh. yes. all the time. Even just sitting here at work, i'll start thinking about him and be blown away. It usually happens too when he hasn't noticed I'm in the room or if he's just standing there telling me a story. I love to see his face light up. It's my favorite.	0
I've noticed that a lot of women women prefer reading/imagining their porn over watching it. Why do you think this is? And why do you think there such a strong preference among men towards visual porn?	A lot of visual porn is not made for women, the majority of it actually is not made for women. It's made with the goal of getting guys off and often isn't appealing because it comes across as fake, or the actors are unattractive, or the close ups are showing body parts that I'm not aroused by.	I think women get more into how a guy makes them feel and men are more about how the chick looks.	1
27 and having a double mastectomy due to cancer. Ladies with implant reconstruction, what can I expect that they don't tell you in the leaflets?	Good luck, and best wishes to you! It's a hard and brave thing. If you smoke, please stop now. One of the BEST things you can do to help your own healing and decrease the risk of complications with any sort of reconstruction (including expanders, flaps, or implants!) is to NOT SMOKE or use any nicotine/tobacco products.	It's probably radical of me, but if I had breast cancer and it was only in one breast, I'd probably opt for double too. Lower risk of recurring cancer, right? Best wishes, you'll be all right though! I was directing that towards the plastic surgery part. ;-) I've never had implants, but I do think that if you request the same cup size as before or smaller, it would probs be gentler on what remains of the breast tissue/muscle. As for nipples, they do very convincing tattoos of them nowadays. Good luck! Hugs to you.	0
I have 4 positive pregnancy tests with a paragaurd in. In what situations have you been in complete denial?	This happens more often than you think. There have been babies born with the device in their bodies. So definitely get this looked into asap..	Please don't stay in denial with this. Pregnancy with an iud has an increased risk of being ectopic. You need to see a doctor asap.	0
Ladies who read the label before buying a product: what ingredients/substances, both in food and cosmetics, do you refuse to buy?	I can't eat MSG, artificial colors, or almonds. Other than that I aim to keep me carb count low, I'm sensitive to sugars.	Anything with palm oil. I know there is sustainable palm oil but I still won't buy it. I prefer vegan items but I know that some of my all time favourite products do contain animal products.	0
I should've have realized when my boyfriend at the time said horrible things about his ex wife, ex girlfriend, and other ladies he dated, that once we broke up he would start talking shit about me. What has happened in a relationship that you overlooked but shouldn't have?	Hmm with one of my last relationships I said bad things about my previous partners but I have since had two partners and have not bad mouthed her to either. Right now I am in a long distance kinda stressful relationship so I bite my tongue with quite a few things in order to make the relationship work out. I probably shouldn't but I think only time will tell.	i had a boyfriend say "if you had your body, but (a girl we both know)'s face, you'd be perfect" and "i'll probably meet someone better than you in the summer". i was extremely low on self-esteem at the time, so i just agreed with him both times. i definitely shouldn't have. putting me down a lot = wouldn't have been a good relationship in the long run.	0
Ladies, what do you talk about with your SO?	Last night he & I discussed bar drinks (we settled on making bourbon & gingers), and then put the GOP debate on mute & guessed what they were talking about (complete with voice overs). It was SUCH a fun evening!	We talk about everything and nothing. The topics that dominate many conversations are how bad or good the flatulance is and poop. Full disclosure he has ulcerative colitis.	1
Do you want to "Free the Nipple"? Is it problematic for you that breasts are so linked to sex?	I'm not a fan of walking topless, because even when showing my nipples becomes legal, creeps gonna creep. But I think it's ridiculous than my female nipples are illegal while male ones are not.	I think it's a ridiculous non-issue that has gotten way too much attention from... certain groups. In terms of breastfeeding, I would like to see that get de-stigmatized. Otherwise, I don't think this is a worthwhile restriction to fight for/ against, whatever their goal is. People are restricted in a society, we can't just eliminate all the rules. E: The breastfeeding thing, though. Maybe I'm just crunchy or something, but just the other day I applauded a lady for breastfeeding at a pub. She looked so touched that I took time to tell her she's awesome. I really don't get how people can be 'against' kids eating lunch in public	1
How have you improved your relationship communication?	My boyfriend and I have recently started trying to set time aside on Sunday nights to talk about anything bothering us. He prefers talking about issues as soon as he thinks of them, but I have a lot of difficulty having calm conversations unless I've had some time to sort out exactly how I'm feeling about something. It was his idea to start scheduling a time that we could both talk about our issues because the way we'd been going about it before had been putting me under a lot of stress. I really like it because if we don't have anything to talk about, it's just time that we can spend alone together away from his roommates talking about lighter, happier stuff.	One thing I have found really helpful is to work on my self-awareness. Why *am* I upset right now? What would help me deal with X or Y? Sometimes I will directly say those things to an SO. "I'm in a really bad mood because of work today, and I need you to please agree that everyone's stupid and annoying for a little bit." It's been very effective.	0
What's the strangest/funniest reaction you've received after rejecting someone?	You heard me wrong, I said you were fat and ugly. If I'm so fat and ugly why don't you fuck off back to your seat and stop bothering me?	When I was using OKCupid, I once got, "I'm going to tell everyone I was rejected by the ugliest girl on this site!" Uh, dude, that insults you more than it insults me.	0
What are your "I can't believe I was in that relationship" stories?	Jesus. I was thinking about answering this question about this guy I dated for 2 years in college who ended up being a drug addict and was horrible to me. I googled him and just found his obituary. Shit.	generally a weenie- avoided confrontation, hated cheesecake, loved cats (i'm a dog person), and was really close with somebody else but "she lived too far away so nothing would ever happen". Looking back on it I remember thinking "Do I even LIKE him?". The answer was no, but I stayed and I have nothing but regret because it kept me from doing things that I really wanted to do at that time in my life. And in the end he was a not nice guy.	1
Let's not be serious for a second here: If you were in an RPG, what class would you be and why?	Y'all need to roll the dice and roleplay whatever dimwitted combination of improbable you happen to get. *Stop worrying; there are no winners, there are no losers. This ain't a game dear, this is a role play game. Woman up and roll the dice* -Me, a couple of hours ago	Reading through this thread is great and fun and fine and all until I realize, "Shit...this is why I can't find any tanks."	0
Girls who got straight A's in school, college, etc., where are you now?	My family was really toxic and I had a miserable, lonely childhood. Due to their high standards and threats if I didn't meet them, was a very high achieving student in high school but tanked in college. After college I did low-level clerical work and hated it. Then I met my husband, he believed in me and agreed that I could do more with my life with just one support person. So he paid for me to go to nursing school, where once again I was a straight-A student. I won an academic contest in my last that gave me a $3000 scholarship and a job interview at a local hospital. I got hired, and have happily been a nurse there ever since!	I'll answer for my sister, young twenties: Recently became a single mom with a 1 year old child, just got a Master's, dropped out of PhD program and can't afford to keep the house without financial assistance from the family.	1
My dad just bought about $90 worth of cheese for Christmas. In what ways do your parents or family members tend to go a little overboard for celebrations?	On Thanksgiving, my mother in law brought six 2-liters of soda in flavors my husband and I enjoy, "In case there wasn't anything we like to drink." Thanksgiving was at me and my husbands house.	Wow! That must be a lot of cans of spray cheese. (For the non-US Redditors: Only a tiny, tiny percentage of Americans eat spray cheese, although I'm sure most have tried it. We have artisanal cheeses made in a huge number of states are are equal to the best cheeses of the rest of the world)	1
Have you ever rejected someone for what seems like a petty reason but it's something that's really important to you?	I couldn't date a guy once because he was just TOO happy and easy going. One time I cancelled our date because I had to work and he was just TOO accepting. "Oh yeah that's fine, I totally understand, it happens to all of us, it's completely okay, we can reschedule.. and he went on and on" I mean, stuff comes up and plans change, and it's good to be acceptingand flexible, but don't ROLL OVER. It's okay to be a little dissapointed and tell me that. I just couldn't date him.	I was driving a dude to lunch and as soon as he got in he started changing all my preset radio stations and adjusting the bass and treble. I asked him to stop and he just laughed and kept going. Never again.	0
What's your funniest sex story?	I accidentally hit the wrong button on my Hitachi, bumped it up two levels and switched it to pulses instead of steady vibrations while I was giving head. I basically fell over and would have hit my head on the headboard but for his quick grab. And then I was exhausted -_- ...	Once I was having sex with this dude, it was all going below averagely until he started shouting "YES RUSSEL SHE'S LOVING IT! YEAH YEAH SHE. IS. LOVING. IT. UH UH UH UH! YOU DA MAN! SHE'S GETTING SO NAILED, SHE LOVES IT!!!!" No I was not loving it, and I was trying to fight back laughter as he flopped around on top of me cheering himself on. I told him to stop and get out of my house because I thought someone was coming home.	0
Did you ever get involved with a multi-level marketing company? What was the result?	I "sold" Mary Kay. I never actually sold anything, but i kind of loved it. My director is a great person, my sister's were awesome and i have everybody great presents that year. No regrets and would totally do it again. Love their products. But, i can see how if you didn't have a supportive team, but had people putting pressure on you to buy inventory instead, it could be an expensive nightmare. But, i lucked out and had a great experience.	I sat through three hours of an eight-hour seminar before realizing it was a pyramid company. I decided to leave after they asked us to provide a list of everyone we know, along with phone numbers and mailing addresses. The product was cleaning supplies.	0
How is sex after childbirth?	It feels about the same to me. It still looks about the same I think, I would have to ask my boyfriend what he thinks. I think we waited about 10 days.	Pretty much the same. Did not notice visual differences. Orgasm at the same rate. We were told to wait six weeks, but waited four because we are both bad at following directions.	0
What stereotype about men has the most negative effects on women?	That men are hapless at housework and childcare. Women are automatically expected to be maternal and the primary caregivers because our society acts like if you leave a guy alone with a kid long enough it'll end up sticky, starved, and tied to a car roof rack going "wheeeee!" as Daddy speeds along the motorway.	That women are less rational/are crazy. It invalidates us, and it's a convenient go-to for whenever some douche doesn't understand and/or likes what he's hearing.	1
How much of a man's attractiveness do you think is under his control?	My opinions: A guy with a 4/10 face (ugly features, no chin, etc) can look kind of okay with a good haircut, good clothes, and if he's tall, but definitely not "wow, he's hot". Similarly, a short guy is never ever going to get a "wow he's hot" response from me. tl;dr not to me, no.	It's very possible. Most guys who are unattractive simply need to lose weight, lift weights, get a new hairstyle, improve their hygiene, or a combination of those and it would take them from a 3 to an easy 7+.	0
I was once offered a free ticket to a concert, which I never made it to since I slipped on ice, broke my front tooth and had an ambulance escort me to the hospital where I received a public intoxication and an underage drinking citation. What would you consider your finest moment?	I was drunk in a bar in Korea. Went out to use the bathroom and slipped on vomit. My drunk mind decided it needed to miss the vomit and I proceeded to land full force on my elbow. I shattered it. Good news is that I didn't land in the vomit.	Nothing nearly so dramatic/bad, but going insane on the Yogg-Saron (an endgame boss in World of Warcraft) fight after I'd been repeatedly reminding my raid group (which I was leading) to keep an eye on their sanity meters. Got teased about that one for literally years afterward.	1
What are the most ridiculous "negs" you've received from guys trying to sleep with you?	"You seem great, I can't figure out why no one has taken you off the market yet" Uhh that's because I *am* great and I haven't found anyone worthy of "taking me off the market" yet.	"I don't really like redheads. I'll make an exception for you, though, because I like your boobs well enough to overlook your red hair." Noped right out of there.	0
Have you given more or received more oral sex during your life?	Given. All the men in this thread bragging about how much they go down on their SO are making me feel ill. I want to comment 'congratulations' on every single one of them. Prime example of extrapolating your personal experience to apply to everybody, ever.	Given. I find men treat getting oral sex as a stand alone item and giving oral sex as occasional foreplay.	0
Does anyone not have kids but still find themselves making decisions for future kids that may or may not even come into existence??	I don't. I'm about 30 now and I'm glad I have never done this because I don't want to make decisions and plan my life around nonexistent kids	Yeah. I'm spending some time watching my roommates two kids at the moment and in my head I am SUCH a backseat parent. I have kept all my opinions to myself but WOW, I had no idea I had this many opinions about childcare. So now it's sort of bleeding into other stuff, like I wanna travel loads so I'm thinking about international schools or boarding schools blah blah. Maybe I have caught the baby bug. Maybe someone needs to inform my SO.	0
anyone else not doing anything for NY?	I'm laying in bed, next to a box of Kleenex, trying to figure out what cold medicine I'm going to take while watching The Good Wife. I'm living the crazy life.	We're not doing anything because the kid won't sleep in. She'll still get up at the crack of dawn no matter when we went to sleep.	1
Is it OK if your SO's ex is now his/her best friend? Where is the fine line in all of this?	The line is trust. Do you trust your SO? If not, why do you stay with them? Why do they stay with you?	That would be a yellow flag or an orange flag for me. Not a straight up no from me but i would only be ok if i was already part of their friend circle and could see the dynamic to make sure there were not boundary issues or some other dysfunction. I know plenty of exes who are good friends but i also know plenty with boundary issues, some who are still fwb and stuff, being emotional backups for each other...i wouldn't want to be in the middle of such a deep connection, i am just not into that kind of drama at my age.	0
Girls on tinder, what do you look for in a guy's bio?	When listing hobbies, please list actual hobbies. No "chilling" or "gym" in fact "gym life" is an automatic pass from me. If you do work out, tell me specifics like "Oh I run marathons, or I fucking love MMA." If you just casually go to the gym, it isn't a super huge part of your life, don't include it to impress someone.	Im a dude in a wheelchair and i have "i love long walks on the beach, except i cant walk and i get stuck in the sand" Girls love something funny about yourself	0
I'm worried that I'm turning into the type of person who needs to tear others down to feel better. Have any of you ever stopped being bitter?	May I suggest you wander over into r/raisedbynarcissists? Edit: I think you would benefit from the perspective of knowing it's not in your head and you're not an ungrateful daughter. You'll find some good resources, as well as support and s safe place to vent. Good luck :-)	I find what helps me in this regard is to stay off social media. Social media can turn people's lives into a spectacle and I find it colors me against people I typically would have neutral feelings towards. Don't spend hours in their lives. Move away. Meet new people. Look for 3 good qualities in everyone you meet.	0
What type of guy is definitely not your type?	Off the top of my head--guys who... * smoke *anything* (so, doing drugs is also a big no) * are into men's rights bullshit/not feminists * are racist/sexist/homophobic, etc. * are obsessed with anime/manga/Cosplay/hentai/Japan * have an Asian fetish (ew, ew, EW) * are super religious * fit into the mold of a stereotypical "manly man" * are very politically conservative. I think I could *maybe* be alright with someone who is fiscally conservative, but NEVER someone who is socially conservative, blech * smell funky/bad Edit: Lmfao, some of you seem to think I hate Asians.... I hate people who FETISHIZE Asians, big fucking difference.	'Lad' types. I think it's the UK equivalent of 'bros' basically. Just lots of rude, loud behaviour disguised as 'banter' and lots of unfunny, often misogynist jokes.	0
Bisexuals of /r/askwomen, what are the biggest differences between how men and women eat pussy?	I've had more women than men down there, and I can't really tell which would have been better. I don't think gender makes a difference over experience and enthusiasm. Women who know their body well may intuitively be better at giving oral, but with communication either gender can be great.	Women are better. At least with enough frequency that it made me stop sleeping with guys (I'm a lesbian-identified bisexual, i.e. am sexually attracted to guys but don't hook up with them anymore). Although it's possible I may just have been with some really amazing women. Edit: And I know it's not just that I've been with crappy guys, cus my straight friends have had similar experiences!	1
How weird do you get when you're alone?	I deliberately amplify the sounds of my farts & burps and I sniff my farts. When around others, I make sure these functions go unheard/unsmelt. I also have this weird laugh that I do when I'm looking at funny things on the internet and I'll laugh hysterically by myself while staring at my computer screen.	Dude here... I make chewbacca noises when cringy thoughts pop in my head when I'm alone. I also sniff anything that comes out of my body.	1
What's something you did to try to fit in with the cool girls that makes you cringe?	Begged my mother to buy me Limited sweatshirts that were like $50 and way more than she could afford, because they were only what the cool girls wore. Freaking ugly sweatshirts too. Ate a bunch of oreos off a platter in the woods that the cool girls broke in half and rubbed dirt and pebbles into the white cream. In order to be a part of their New Kids on the Block Fanclub that met daily in summers in the woods behind our houses, I had to eat every single one while they sat there laughing at me as I gagged. I ate them all though.	Not a damn thing. I was the intelligent, goth/rock chick who sat in classrooms throughout school and made the cool girls worry. Hehe	1
Married women, what is one thing that you skipped on your wedding day that you do not miss? Or what do you wish you had skipped?	I cut out wedding favors because who wants a bar of soap with my face on it? And I cut out the father/daughter and mother/son dances because my MIL is a harpy from the deep who would take her moment in the sun and milk it (like commandeering a microphone and giving an inappropriate speech). We also didn't do cake but did donuts and churros instead lol.	I'm getting married this year and am skipping the following things, which I don't intend to regret: * Bridal shower * Rehearsal dinner * Formal reception after the ceremony (dinner at a restaurant with only 20 people instead) * A professional photographer & staged photo shoot * Engagement photos and Save the Dates * Engagement ring and proposal * Bridesmaids or groomsmen or any bridal party * An aisle and walking down it * A bouquet and a veil * Bridal lingerie * Getting ready robes or lounge wear * Professional hair and makeup All of this is just about our personal preferences and not cost.	1
At what point in the relationship is there implicit sexual permission?	>At what point in the relationship is there implicit sexual permission? Never. >When is it, or is it ever, acceptable to simply assume sexual permission in a relationship? Never.	I feel that there is never all-encompassing implicit sexual permission, but at some point you should know what your partner likes and dislikes and should have a general idea on their limits. Since it is impossible to go over every scenario ever, you should be able to make generally accurate judgement calls on these things from the likes/dislikes/limits you have explicitly discussed. Personally, I don't think it's odd for a partner to maybe touch a butt or play with breasts while the other is asleep and so if I had an issue with it I would likely bring that up before it happens. If I didn't have the foresight for that, I would not be upset if I had to swat a hand away groggily, especially since I know my partner would listen and he would never intentionally do something I am uncomfortable with.	0
What is something you'd like to say to a friend/ coworker/ relative/ partner, but can't for whatever reason? What is the reason you cannot?	Forget your boyfriend, he doesn't love you like I do and come back home because you're the only one that puts up with me and I miss you. I can't say that because she's my best friend and she's happy where she is. I don't exactly want to spoil things for her.	Honestly, sometimes I just want to gush to my friends about how much I love them and think they're amazing people who deserve all the best in life and I want them to be so happy. But I get self-conscious and I think that could easily be awkward for everyone so I keep it to myself.	0
What is the absolutely stupidest and incorrect thing/comment you have ever seen upvoted on reddit?	Someone asserted that Native Americans don't exist. Basically, my friend ID'd herself as Native American in the OG comment, and someone ranted at her that saying you're Native American is like saying you have Neanderthal DNA and that she was an idiot for believing that she was a made up race, and then called her an SJW/special snowflake. She still laughs hysterically when she brings this up and it happened like 2 years ago on AskReddit.	I might get downvoted for this, but I see a lot of fatlogic on /r/askwomen If you are okay with being fat, that's fine. But it's not healthy, and it's not an irreversible condition. Nobody is genetically fat, it frustrates me when I see people say there is nothing they can do and spout wildly incorrect information about nutrition and health and weight loss.	1
Ladies, what's your all-time favorite recipe?	For breakfast: Avocado toast. Just toast a slice of bread, mash up half an avocado on top, add two slices of tomato and some feta, and finish with a pinch of garlic salt and sriracha. So easy. So good. So filling.	Tie, between pumpkin chip cookies, and a chicken casserole recipe. I don't make it often, but when I do, people love it. It's chicken, shredded, with spices, covered in corn dough. What's not to like? I also have a vegan lasagna recipe that I've taken to parties and even the non vegans devoured it.	1
What are some things you admired about your ex you wish your current SO had or did?	A lot of women here are saying they wish their SO would do more sweet things for them. Is that all women care about? Being loved? Ever think of maybe giving your SO some love too, or do you just want to receive it? So many here are saying 'he took me on cool dates' or 'he complemented me'. Do you ever do stuff like that for your SO? Probably not, no. So imagine what that feels like. You're here complaining that your SO doesn't do these sweet little things for you when you literally do NONE of that for him anyway. It's completely one sided.	My ex was very touchy feely kind of guy and constantly complimented me and I sometimes wish my Husband had more of that [he is not a very romantic person]. But then I get over it when I realize how honest my SO is in comparison with my ex. I know he means it when he says something romantic. My ex just used sweet words to manipulate me instead of being straight so...	0
Has anybody else encountered guys who can't handle the sight of pubic hair on a woman?	Oh god yes I knew one like that. I myself prefer being clean down there but the way he emphasised on how disgusting and what a dealbreaker it was ticked me off. Stop seeing him real quick.	I had a great first date with a guy once, and we decided to fool around in my car afterward. He stuck his hand down my pants at a certain point, then froze and asked me, "Hey, if we continued dating, would you be cool with shaving this?" Points to him for getting that out of the way I guess, but also pretty bad timing. We didn't go out again, although it wasn't because of that.	0
What's the most cringe-inducing thing a guy you've just met has said to you?	This is my mom's story. My parents are divorced and she's gone on a few dates with guys that she met using online dating services. Story 1: My mom meets a man for the first time and really likes him. He's nice, funny, good looking, and he even insists on paying for the meal. The date is going perfectly right up until the end when the topic of gay marriage comes up. Note, my mom's sister is a lesbian and we live in an area where it's uncommon for people to oppose gay marriage. Completely deadpan the man said, "oh of course being gay isn't a choice, after all it is a genetic mutation."	Didn't happen to me, but a co-worker had a guy try to chat her up by complimenting the music we were playing in the café. And then tried to impress her with his music knowledge by telling her that the David Bowie song currently playing (The Man Who Sold The World) was 'actually originally by Nirvana'. And then argued the point.	0
Has anyone ever done a sleep study?	I tried to get a sleep study done as well because I did have horrible issues with sleeping. When I saw the doctor, he told me that my sleeping had less to do with sleeping issues like sleep apnea or narcolepsy, and more to do with my mood (like depression). I'm not sure if all sleep studies are similar, but he basically said I couldn't do the sleep study because I didn't have a sleeping disorder as mentioned above. Do you think you have a sleeping disorder (like falling asleep during inappropriate times, sleep walking, trouble breathing when sleeping, etc.) or do you think it has to do with your mood or lifestyle? I still did struggle with my sleeping issues, but I think it helped as my mood became better and my depression seemed to "go away".	I did this past August. Turns out I've had sleep apnea for most of my life but it was never diagnosed, to the point that I wasn't breathing for most of the time spent asleep. I also had major tonsil issues that were affecting my breathing, particularly at night. I was given a CPAP machine and it's been incredible. I can't even imagine how much sleep I've missed out on in the past few years. The mask is annoying, and it's super unsexy, but I actually sleep through the night now. Especially with my tonsils gone. I'd say to do the study just in case.	0
Ladies, what sex act are you scared to ask your partner to do?	I don't have anything I'm scared to ask my SO for. Both of us are into some really kinky stuff, so we discuss things regularly because that's what you do if you want a healthy sex life.	I want to watch my husband masturbate. We've been married for 12 years and it took me about a decade to ask him but he won't do it. Sad times... Maybe someday! I let him watch me.	0
What have you done for a partner who you thought you'd never do?	Anal with my last ex. Never again. I use to actually swallow and now I can't anymore. It actually makes me very sick.	Clean up blood. I do not do blood. But when the person you love has blood coming out of them, you do what you have to do to make it stop.	0
What is a red flag in regards to dating a woman?	- talks about exes often - super clingy - wants to search through your computer/phone and feels entitled to - She drops all her friends as soon as she is dating you - enjoys ultimatums - guilt trips hardcore - always wants to go out with you your friends - she thinks being "crazy" is a good thing and waves that flag proud - expects that a "man takes care of her" in life. These are red flags that can pertain to men or women though, just swap a few words around. lol	If her Facebook info says "Likes Men". Often times, it's normal for someone to not explicitly admit that they're queer on social media, because they might not be out at work, or some other social group that you'll never meet. But if it says "Likes Men", she is clearly closeted to some group of people close enough to her that you will have to pretend to be a "Gal Pal" at some point.	1
What's your latest "Dammit! I'm an adult so I can!" moment?	Going to sleep late. I'm married and don't live with my mother but she'll sometimes call me because she sees that I'm on FB past 11pm and scold me for it as if I'm a child. I snapped the last time she did it.	I'm not working and haven't for a couple of years by choice (and mental illness), I wake up around 12noon and do whatever.	1
During sex with my partner, I said in a dirty voice that his grabbing my ass was like "you're kneading two lumps of dough". Cheer me up with some embarrassing times you failed at being sexy?	Not sure why I'm seeing this because I'm not a woman. But my wife, back when we actually had sex, once sneeze and got snot all over me. Wasn't that bad.	I was having stupid drunk sex with my ex-boyfriend and I was on top. He grabbed a hold of my rib cage with both hands, close to my armpits and it tickled SO much. I told him to stop, but he didn't and I just peed. Peed all over him. Yep...	0
Ladies, how do you feel about blaming the "Other Woman"?	I think it depends on the extent of knowledge. I think the person in the actual relationship always holds the most blame, just to clarify that first. As for the other party, irrelevant to gender for me, it goes on a combo of knowledge and action with knowledge. Other party had zero knowledge of relationship? Zero blame. Other party was aware of relationship but did not actively pursue party in relationship? Some blame. Other party was aware of relationship and actively pursued party in the relationship? Much more blame, but with primary blame still on party in the relationship.	It's unfair and frankly sexist to only blame the man if the other woman knows she is the other woman. If she knows she is an accomplice in cheating, then both of them are at fault.	1
Women who married young and had GOOD results, would you do it differently?	Well, not married technically, but we've been together (basically moved in together for all intents and purposes the week we started dating) when I was 19 and he was 22. Still together 12 years later. The relationship is awesome, though we've had our ups and downs. I think the thing that has kept us together is that we are always kind to one another. What makes the relationship even way 100-times better than it was 12 years ago was that we worked on it and figured out how to grow together and change as individuals, but not grow apart. It's super important if you consider that a full and rich life involves personal growth, but you've decided that you want to be partners on the journey and that journey is a fucking long time. I feel like I didn't articulate that well, though. Sorry.	Married at 23/24, now 39/40. Had kids at 28 and 30, so not too early in that part. We are still stupidly happy. We are still very much in love. We have lots of sex. He's the best partner I could ever ask for. Life is really, really good. My only "regret" is that I never lived on my own -- I went straight from college roommates to living with my now-husband. But financially it was never practical, so oh well.	0
Just had an idea stolen from me at work, have any other women here had their ideas "re purposed" away from them in the workplace?	Yes! Not too long ago. I teach at a college, and a close female colleague and someone I considered a friend asked, supposedly just in general conversation, if I had any ideas for a committee we both served on. I told her an idea I had been working on for a while, and, bizarrely, she wrote it down as I told her about it. At that point, I had a feeling she was going to poach, so I bluntly asked her not to bring it up at the committee meeting, and she agreed. Fast forward to the meeting the next day, first thing out of her mouth? My idea. She didn't even mention my name with it. She just basically pretended it was solely her idea that she had come up with all on her own. Needless to say, we're not friends anymore.	At my old job, I asked a female mentor about this specific problem and she gave me some advice that I still think about today. She said that a lot of the time, having an idea ignored can be due to the way women present their ideas. As a disclaimer, I'm not to trying to say that this is the only reason our ideas get ignored or that women bear all the fault. Basically, women tend to speak more passively subconciously. Do you tend to use passive or "emotional" phrases, such as "I think..." or "I feel that..."?	1
Will you tell us your reccuring dream, and we can all pseudo-psychologically interpret each others dreams?	I will get into an elevator and head for a floor in the middle of the building. But it keeps going up to the very top. I start panicking and mashing buttons because it skipped my floor. The cable snaps and the elevator free falls down. I always wake up before the elevator crashes.	I didnt have a reoccuring dream, but a few nights ago i had a dream i was having a conversation with a mentally challenged person. They kept getting harder and harder to understand to the point that I felt frustrated and it was just noises coming out of their mouth. My frustration woke me up and I realized my sub-conscious was having a conversation with my fiance's high-pitched snoring. I woke him up laughing and we were up from 1am - 3am cracking up nonstop.	0
Do any of yall only air dry your hair?	I have curly hair, hair dryers are the devil. My hair instantly turns into one clump of frizzy nastiness if I use a blow dryer.	Yup I NEVER blow dry my hair unless I'm going to a super fancy event (so once-twice a year max at the moment). My blowdryer only works 30% of the time and I don't care enough to replace it. Not a tomboy, tonnes of female friends. Just very low maintenance.	1
Mixed race ladies, what are your unique experiences in regards to your ethnicity/race?	I'm tan, and everybody jokingly called me Mexican in school. Honestly I didn't really remember having a problem with it, except maybe sometimes when it might have been getting old or derogatory. And airport security always gets me, even would separate me from my white mother sometimes. I'm french actually, and strangely whenever somebody would remark about the french I'd take it a little personal... Just a fun fact.	When I was younger I definitely looked hispanic (my family is from Cuba) and had an accent to match. I grew up in a hispanic area so I never really thought about it. But then I moved to another country when I was 19. Every time I flew, US security would question and search me, and occasionally pull me aside to another room for further questions. The first time I flew with my husband (as pastey white as they come), was the first time I flew without all that. I never thought of myself as anything other than a typical white American before then. Now I live where it's cold, I lost my tan, and most of my accent, so now people are surprised to hear I am hispanic.	0
I see a whole lot of articles about "why women wear makeup" but what about "why women don't wear makeup"?	My personal friends wear makeup for two main reasons: they genuinely enjoy putting it on, and/or it makes them feel more confident. I don't wear makeup for two main reasons: I genuinely hate applying it, and it makes me feel more insecure because I'm so used to my face without makeup that I feel clownish with it on.	Makeup is whatever you want it to be. You can have a makeup routine that takes an hour and uses tons of expensive products, or you can have a makeup routine that takes 1 minute and uses two or three cheap products from the drugstore. You can choose to wear elaborate eyeshadow and heavy foundation, or you can choose to dab some concealer on a pimple and powder your nose. So I don't think there's a sharp distinction between "wearing makeup" and "not wearing makeup."	1
What is the one trait you do NOT like in a man?	If he spend more time grooming then me. I want a man who showers and has good hygiene, but girlish manicured hands, designer clothes, and hair that requires products are a turn off for me.	The kind of insecurity that leads a man to continually assert his masculinity. It's very tiring and frustrating to be around.	0
Today is my 35th birthday, and the first thing I heard from a friend this morning was "hate to say it, but your age is showing." What's the worst thing you were ever told on your birthday?	*Why aren't you married already? You don't wanna die alone, don't you?* (I especially love this in passive - agressive tone.) Every Birthday for about 3 years now. I'm 26. Also, last year: "Your wrinkles are showing. You should use a cream for this. You're 25." Like, the day before I looked just fine, then it's my Birtday and suddenly, over one night I got wrinkles?!	Maybe not the worst thing, but akward none the less On my 25th birthday I invited some friends to a local pub where most off the staff knows us. The new waitress comes over and asked me my ID, all my friends and some staff members started laughing as I and the new waitress just stood there akwardly as we didn't knew how to respond to that.	1
Women who cheated on your SO, but don't regret it, what's your story?	I cheated on every partner I had for the first 20 years of dating - either emotionally or sexually (usually both). I don't regret it because regretting things is a waste of my time and energy. To note: I've now been polyamorous for 5+ years and this is a much better system for me.	We both moved away for uni and were really far apart and I felt and I was feeling vulnerable in a new place. I felt bad but didn't regret it. Stopped feeling bad when I found out he did the same. In retrospect we should have broken up as we both knew we hated long distance relationships but neither has the balls to say it. Still don't regret it and still don't feel bad but fully acknowledge the immaturity and trashiness of the whole situation. Real learning curve	0
Ladies, what is the most unusual or interesting job you've had?	Right after college, I interned at an exotic cat sanctuary. Lived on-site in the middle of nowhere, butchered beef hearts and chickens in the mornings, and fed them to tigers and bengal hybrids and whatnot with barbecue tongs in the afternoons. Also scooped exotic poop! Now I've shifted lanes and I'm interning as a software engineer for an asteroid mining startup. I've also been a bear builder, zoo educator, and vivarium manager. My resume is a hot mess. EDIT: On my commute home, I realized I forgot about the time I was an assistant to a veterinary dentist!	I worked in a butcher shop. And not just as some check out girl either! I could cut steaks with the best of them. Had to run a deer through the bandsaw though :(	1
What's a red flag that you feel a lot more women should be aware of?	Clinginess or neediness that can turn ugly. A short fuse that they quickly try to gloss over. Putting themselves down but acting like they are above others.	Similar to littering, I live in an area with free municipal recycling. So I'd say zero effort of trash sorting. One time my friends group went out to a rural area for the weekend with no recycling service. We saved it all and drove it the two hours back to town to put in our home recycling :p	1
Ladies, last night my SO told me, "You aren't the best looking girl I've dated but you *are* the best girlfriend I've ever had." What things has your SO told you that made you question your relationship?	As a man, I cannot understand why that would upset you so much. I know that he could have just said "you are the best girlfriend I ever had", but is your happiness really that tied up in him pretending that you are the most beautiful woman who ever agreed to go out with him? His previous girlfriends' looks are unimportant at this point. The important thing is that he values you over all of them for other qualities. Those qualities might even be more important and less superficial than your appearance. You should take that as a very nice compliment even if it was a bit awkwardly worded.	i don't know...i don't think this would bother me too much. my husband isn't the best looking man i've dated either...BUT he is head and shoulders above all the other men i've ever dated with regards to integrity, intelligence, humour, character...pretty much everything. the guy is a dream. who cares if he's not the most attractive? he's the "most" at all the other measures that really count.	0
I just got an impromptu "wax" while pulling my underwear down to pee because my pad somehow got twisted and the adhesive side got stuck to my pubes. Anyone else have any woman-specific mishaps lately?	I'm 39 weeks pregnant, how much time do you have?? Lol I walk like John Wayne, i have a doctor probe my cervix every 7 days and a bowling ball sitting on my bladder.	I have read the tampon instructions that say "always remove an old tampon before inserting a new one" and thought: what kind of idiot would just keep shoving them up there? A couple months ago, I took out a tampon, then I'm wiping and feel what I thought was a bit of toilet paper but was a string. Surprise! Secret forgotten tampon. No wonder the last TWO times I put one in it was all uncomfortable and difficult. FAIL.	0
When referring to yourself, are you a woman or are you a girl?	I feel like a girl, but refer to myself as a woman. Because I want to be seen and treated as a capable adult, not an overgrown child. 31 years old.	I (age 22, 23 tomorrow) identify as genderfluid, but when I feel female, I say girl in front of friends and woman in front of almost everyone else. I guess I do this because I'm afraid of not being taken seriously.	1
What is the dumbest thing a man has ever said to you about women?	I'm 20 years old. These guys were 18-19. They told me that having sex with pregnant women was dangerous for the baby since it meant that you could poke the baby's soft skull. It took me an hour to convince them that they were wrong.	"Men are like dogs and women are like cats. Men are happy-go-lucky, while women will claw your eyes out when you least expect it." I have heard this from multiple men. In each case, it was a man who was trying to get me to date him.	1
Mattel has "evolved" Barbie to have four new body types. What do you think?	They're not really different body 'types,' just various weights. All similar heights. Similar hair. All still pretty. Still an idealized version of beauty, just some aren't as thin. IMO, I think it was a clever marketing tool by Mattel brought on by the HAES crowd. I love Barbie and buy them for my nieces, but don't really have an opinion otherwise beyond thinking it was good marketing	You know, as a kid, I would've been thrilled, but not for the body representation. I would've literally just done this: "The bigger one is the mommy, the tall one is gonna be a daddy and I'll cut his hair (I never wanted Ken dolls), the littlest one is the baby sister, and then this one is the big sister!" And then I'd try to remove the 'daddy' doll's make-up with turpentine, wipe off its face altogether, try to draw it back on with sharpie, grow bored, and go do something else.	0
What's your favorite romcom and what about it makes it your favorite?	You've Got Mail. It's just such a great movie. I always feel hopeful about finding love after watching that movie.	The Proposal, Pretty in Pink, When Harry Met Sally, the Wedding Singer, 13 Going on 30. So many good ones	1
Are you attracted to a mans butt?	What do you mean we don't do anything with a butt? We grab it, squeeze it, slap it, and just look at it. When I had a FWB I saw his bare ass all the time.	Yes. Yes, I will do something with it. I will grab it, slap it, squeeze it, rub it, and I might even bite it...	1
What's your one beauty secret, that now you know you'd never go back?	Sunscreen, every day. Doesn't matter if the sun is out those uva rays are everywhere. I only wish I started sooner though!	Have a baby. Now you not wearing makeup, looking like you haven't showered in a few days, and are wearing the same clothing as yesterday with a mystery stain is perfectly acceptable!	1
Do you ever picture the calendar year in your head? What does your mental calendar look like?	My mental calendar is totally based on my school calendar, with September at the start and summer far, far away at the end.	In my head my calendar is a circle too. It has no up or down, because in this circle I always stand on the date and look across it - where the other months are... It's really hard to explain ._. Each month has a special colour, january is light blue, february is red, march is orange, ...;	1
What is the most presumptuous thing someone has done, or said to you?	At an informal dinner w/vendors this guy started speaking to me in Spanish. When i told him No habla, he starts lecturing me that I should be ashamed for not knowing the language and denying my Puerto Rican heritage. I'm black and my last name is Irish in origin, so...yeah.	I remember in school my peers asking if a local vicar that came in to do assemblies was my dad. He wasn't and we looked nothing alike. A few years later they asked if the sexual health nurse was my mum. Again, no resemblance or relation. They often wouldn't believe me when I'd tell them who my sister was. After some insistence on my part, they'd then assume we were only half siblings. Nope, fully related. I think a lot of the confusion stemmed from the fact my sister and I ignored eachother at school because I was being bullied at the time and she didn't want to end up having to deal with that too. Can't say I blame her, it wasn't much fun.	1
Older Women in STEM, do you feel a change of attitude towards women in STEM?	I'm a female STEM student currently in chemistry. I've found in my internships there's usually equal amounts of both genders if not more women. That being said I have encountered some individualized sexism from coworkers. For example we had a post-doc ask us why we spent so much time in lab and didn't go out to the bar looking for husbands. But I feel like that has more to do with that guys individual beliefs than STEM as a whole. Also had a male coworker touch my waist inappropriately in lab and asked me if I wanted to babysit his daughters (I already have a 40 hr/week job that pays well). It's just small things like that but overall the field has been pretty fair/equal in my experience.	Male student here, but from what I've heard from my female colleagues the real gauntlet is the academic world. Treatment of white collar female workers in the business world has improved greatly, particularly in STEM fields. The job market for female STEM workers is very robust, but many university departments are still good ol' boy networks which are stuck decades behind the times.	1
What NON GENDER double standard annoys you the most?	When a religious person talks about his religion, puts up posters about it outside, ring all the church bells, azan and alike to whole neighborhood it's "belief liberty", but when atheists say religions suck, they do harm, are not real, we get accused by being disrespectful to other beliefs and with hate.	People who say that hard work is admirable and wonderful but treat poor people badly and say that they're lazy. Poor people work super hard to make ends meet. What they're really saying is "only some types of work are worthy", which is really disgusting.	0
What's your shitty superpower?	I can induce dizziness on myself by only thinking about it, it usually takes like 5 minutes max to become dizzy. Edit: Without having to spin around or any physical activity. Edit2: Just realized this is AskWomen, oh well.	Being in the way. Somehow, no matter where I stand or which way I move, I am *always* in someone's way.	0
Anyone have those dreams that a so real you really don't want to wake up?	Yes, I have those occasionally. Sometimes they're about loved ones who have died, and I feel heartbroken when I wake up. On the flip side, I also occasionally have some awful nightmares, and I get to wake up from those thinking "Whew -- so I *don't* have a wasting plague that's making my teeth fall out while all my junior high school crushes point and laugh at me. It's already shaping up to be a good day!" Everything has its silver linings, I guess. :)	I used to have those all the time! But now since I have class at 8 AM IN THE FUCKING MORNING (I'm about to leave now) I can't continue dreaming. I do on the weekends though..and I do stay 'asleep' as long as I can to like try to get to a conclusion of the dream.	1
Are you ok with being naked in a sauna?	I lived in Russia and, after a bit of initial discomfort, didn't have an issue being naked in the saunas. Culturally, it's much less of a big deal though, and it (from what I experienced) was split between genders.	For me it's more of a sanitation issue as opposed to body image/self-consciousness/privacy. I'd be worried about catching something someone else's naked booty left behind. I've also been to onsens so maybe that's why it's not a huge deal to me.	1
Can we talk about not washing hair?	Wouldn't even try it. I get sweaty for fun, and that leads to gross hair, so it gets washed very regularly.	My sister and I have both tried the no poo method and we have super oily hair like yours. The difference is that we have thick hair, but that should make it more magical right? Yeah it never became magical for us and we just had greasy hair for a month. This no-poo method is not a magical method for all hair types - some of us need a good washing! I did find a shampoo at lush that allows me to go every other day without washing because it works great for oily hair.	0
What are some unwritten "Lady Laws"?	Don't mess with another women's SO, or even an ex bf. If you and me are friends and you're trying to hit on my ex. That's a big No No to me.	Thou shalt pretend you know that girl at the bar who is giving anyone and everyone the pleading eyes when some creepy dude is scamming on her and save her.	0
You have to eat 20 pounds (9 kilograms) of one food. You cannot eat anything else until you finish that food, but you have no time constraints. What food would you be totally fine with having to eat? Which food would make you hate everything about this situation?	Good: Pizza. I could have it for every meal. Bad: Shellfish because damn I am allergic so I think I would either die of starvation or through anaphylaxis	Pasta with my moms gravy. I have been told that mine is better but for some reason I like my moms more and I somehow never get sick of it.	1
What is an aspect of (traditional) masculinity that you think more women should work to embrace/adopt/integrate?	Financial independence. It's nice to have people pay for you every once in a while, but I wish some women would think about the situation instead of accepting every free drink offered. Is it really worth saving $5? I could go even deeper into financial independence from parents and boyfriend/husbands, but I'm on mobile right now.	Assertiveness. So many women I interact with professionally will downplay their opinions and stances. They'll use softer language as if they're timid or trying not to step on toes. I'm guilty of this myself and have to work to use stronger, confident language when I need to.	0
What TV show or movie that Reddit loves can you not get into?	How I Met Your Mother It's like the lowest brow comedy and I hate all the characters. Don't understand the obsession.	Seinfeld. The Simpsons. Not to pick on them specifically - I've never really found sitcoms all that compelling - but they both seem to be Reddit darlings.	1
What is the most recent thing on (mainstream) Reddit that made you think "fuck this shit world and all who inhabit it"?	Seeing sexist comments in programming/technology subs is very personally discouraging to me. It doesn't make me mad, just makes me feel kinda down when I realize that I might run into attitudes like that once I get into the industry. Oh well, can't let that stop me.	All of the hate that Hillary Clinton gets over in /r/politics. I personally support her candidacy for president, but don't hate Bernie Sanders. He's just not the guy I want to vote for. The sheer amount of *hate* that woman receives there, along with other online forums is absolutely astonishing to me. A lot of people who hate her can be super condescending to Hillary supporters, or undecideds as well. That's not to say there aren't Hillary supporters online who are just as rude, but I feel like the HRC hate is *strong* on here. I just don't understand why all those fervent Bernie supporters aren't channeling that hate over on the opposite party line. If your candidate does what he needs to do to get votes, he'll win the primaries and move to the general. You hating on and belittling HRC on Reddit isn't going to change that.	1
What do you think of Gloria Steinem's statement that women who support Bernie Sanders are doing so because they want to please "the boys"?	It's pretty fucking irritating when anyone assumes I do anything to please the boys or be like the boys or some nonsense like that.	No, no, no! I don't support Hillary because she's just like all the rest of them. Washington has changed her. Yes, I think Bill Clinton was one of the best presidents our country has ever had. I think a lot of that had to do with the time during which he was president. I do not think Hillary could replicate what Bill did. As a NYer, I know that she just used my state as a jumping off point for her political aspirations. She didn't give a shit about us. Bernie Sanders is, I think, the only politician I would ever trust. If he said the sky would falling, I'd definitely run and hide. I honestly don't think he would lie to us. He's walked the walk. And, he'll keep walking the walk.	1
Ladies, do you ever get frustrated when you get yourself all hot-ified and your SO doesn't even seem to notice?	My grandmother used to do this on purpose to my grandfather. He would leave bouquets of flowers somewhere in the house for her to find, or little gifts. (he would just randomly do this) My grandmother would always pretend to not notice them, and my grandfather would get more and more upset until she couldn't hold it in any longer and started giggling. Then she would exagerate finding them, and gush for an hour while he beamed lol.	Sounds like passive-aggression to me. Is he the kind of guy who will "dig in his heels" if he feels pressured or expected to say/do something?	1
Girls, what is something about men which makes you realize they will probably be a dud boyfriend over time?	If they talk about having kids, and talk about their career plans as future "must-haves" and doesn't acknowledge that any time sacrifices or delays in their career will need to be made so they can take care of their children, especially during the early years.	Never following through on things. Saying "Let's do X" or "I think we should go to Y" or "I need to Z" and then making excuses for why those things can't happen now when you bring them up.	0
Have you noticed that friendships where you got really close really quickly, have a tendency to end badly?	Yeah, I've been through this a couple of times. Learnt the hard way that the girl who hugs you within a couple of weeks and calls you her "best friend ever!" might not be the most stable and is likely to turn on a dime.	I was just thinking about this! I have been burned a few times now, and I'm at the point where I have mostly guy friends. And I know ladies here hate when people say, "oh I hate drama, I don't have a lot of female friends," as they usually start the drama, but this is honestly true for me.	1
What's your win of the week?	Discovered a new nsfw subreddit. Ninja edit: meh, didn't realise I was posting in AW. Fuck it, the sub is awesome.	I successfully merged work friends with non-work friends for a trivia team. We didn't win the big prize but we did great and everyone got along.	0
Ladies, I just puked in front of a customer. What's the most embarrassing thing you've ever done at work?	I almost cried in front of a bunch of coworkers in another department. It was that time of the month and another coworker in that same department was being kinda rude (and later talked about me to one of the coworkers in my department, who ended up defending me). All of this on my anniversary... Kinda soured things :/	I was joking around with a coworker while no one was in the store. He said something and I yelled "no one loves you and Santa doesn't exist either!" When I turned around there was a Mom and little girl in the doorway. The girl started crying. I got written up for telling a kid that Santa doesn't exist.	0
Does anyone else feel meh about giving blowjobs?	I do it because my husband loves it. I only enjoy it when he is moaning, being loud, etc. He used to hold back and be quiet, so it was really boring for me. But hearing him enojying it like nothing else. Is your partner overly silent when you do it? I know that for me, it hurts my jaw when I am in front of him, my face facing him(i guess typical pose?). It is infinitely more comfortable if i am facing his legs. 69 is a great position just because of this. I also love 69 because I get something out of it as well :) I normally can't finish through oral, but we are in that position he seems to hit more places, and i think me being on top tends to pull my insides in just the right place. You should try that!	i think a lot of people exaggerate how much they like giving head just to seem cool or impress people, so i wouldn't feel bad if it's not something you get a lady boner over. i don't think that makes you prudish at all! i personally really enjoy it to a point, but i have the worst gag reflex so sometimes that kills it for me. but besides that it's something that really gets me going, especially surprise bjs. it also depends on the size. anything that's over maybe 7 and fairly thick is overwhelming to me	1
What's the worst negative metamorphosis you've seen somebody go through?	A girl that was a close "friend" of mine in middle and high school turned into a nasty shit to me when I came out. In college she came out herself, and actually became more homophobic towards femmes, and is essentially the Boo stereotype. Also, this salesman I know named Gregor turned into some sort of giant insect like creature.	On a totally shallow and physical level, a few of my friends at school have done a reverse uglyduckling. One girl has gained loads of weight, grew loads in height but nothing else, gotten really sweaty and greasy, got a really bad haircut, developed bad posture and has made some seriously questionable fashion choices.	1
What is a physical trait a lot of women consider as a bad thing on women that you see as a good thing?	Moustaches. I cbf doing anything with mine and it always makes me happy to find a fellow can't-be-fucked-eradicating-my-mousy type woman. Also knuckle hair. I love my knuckle hair and I think it's cute on everyone.	Freckles! Loads of people seem to think freckles are super ugly and I'm like..huh!? They also make for super awesome portraits!	0
I'm going on vacation to Hawaii this Friday. What things have you forgotten to pack for vacation so I can learn from your mistakes?	I once forgot shoes on a summer road trip. My flip flops were bothering me so I took them off to finish loading the car, then somehow forgot to put them back on before leaving. They were the only shoes I'd planned on wearing.	Something at least a little dressy. On our honeymoon, my husband didn't bring long pants. We couldn't get into some places because we were too casual. It's easier being a woman, just bring a dress, but nonetheless, make sure you've got something that'll look decent if necessary.	0
What's an unusual deal breaker that you have?	I dont think these should be unusal, but seeing how much people complain when I mention them, I supose they are: 1. Lives with parents. 2. Lives with roommates. 3. Doesn't drive. 4. Drinks or smokes at all. 5. Has kids. 6. Wants kids. 7. Thinks he even *might* want kids some day.	You just reminded me that I once broke up with a guy because I realised that side-on he looked like my brother and I found that too weird! As for unusual deal breakers, I guess I really hate tribal tattoos and will probably assume bad things about you for having one if I don't actually know you.	0
When you're being private in public, like reading a book alone at a coffee shop, does potential socialization with strangers come with the territory?	If you're in public, socialization can be expected. However, declining to socialize can also be expected. It's a two way street.	I think it's reasonable to expect that another person would be able to read into the fact that you're focused on something and not interrupt you. However, this is not always the case when I've tried to study in public. I've had headphones in while taking notes out of a textbook and had people try and start conversations.	1
How are you doing? Anything you need to get off your chest? Any exciting plans for this weekend?	Saturday is my birthday and I'm feeling kinda bummed this year... so with gas prices low and weather being mild this weekend I'm taking a road trip to see my sister.	Today was awful Tweaked my back at the gym Car tire had irreparable leak so had to buy four tires(thank god I have good credit, but also burnt through half my savings I have been working hard to build back up after a bad financial year) New swimsuit came in and is like five pounds away from fitting me so normally not an issue but just icing on the worm cake... Then I was playing minecraft to unwind and relax and I play on an online server and someone had claimed a section where I was building somehow so now I have to wait for a server admin to fix the issue.... Anyways at work now so hopefully my bad luck is over and work goes well!	1
As a uber driver who drives late at night, when I drop off female passengers, do I wait for them to enter their home/apt building safely, or is that creepy and I should drive off immediately?	I'd be very pleased if a driver asked me what I prefer, and would most likely say yes unless I got some weird vibes. I've been locked out of my house with a dead phone at 3AM before! Without warning it may seem creepy.	I personally prefer when they drive off immediately, because when people sit there my main thoughts are "They're staring at my ass while I walk away," "They are trying to see which apartment I walk into," or just "Huh, that's creepy. Hope I don't get murdered in my sleep," ha. But I have anxiety that probably contributes to those thoughts, so it might be different for people without anxiety.	1
What is your opinion on Obama cutting the funding for abstinence only sex education programs?	On the one hand I think if a school is a private religious school it's their business what they teach students (but then I suppose their funding would come from a private source anyway) (I don't know much about it, sorry). On the other hand, I think it's important to know how to keep yourself safe from diseases and what to do in the event that you become pregnant. I hate to see people constantly making bad decisions that ruin their lives later, and I think early education might be a good deterrent. I also think self-esteem plays into sexual health, but that's a hard thing to teach.	Good. The government shouldn't waste money on programs that don't work and spread misinformation. Refusing to teach kids about safe sex only makes them ill equipped to deal with it. Kids are going to have sex anyway, regardless of whatever "promises" they make to adults. Hell, even Bristol Palin, who *gets paid* to preach abstinence, was able to get knocked up 2 different times out of marriage, so you can see what a joke abstinence only education is.	0
What's the most hurtful thing a loved one has said or done to you recently and how are you dealing with it?	"Honestly, we're all just kind of sitting here waiting for you to die so our lives will be easier and calmer" -my dad when I was 16 in treatment	"Your life isn't harder than anyone else's, be glad you're at least healthy" Half an hour ago by my mom. Sure, I have to take 5 different meds every day and probably for the rest of my life, enduring all their nasty side effects, or I'll go back to self-violence and trying suicide again. But sure, Mom, I'm *super* healthy and just being dramatic. Sounds petty but it's hurting.	1
What is the most selfish and/or unrealistic thing you want in a relationship?	I need a lot of "me" time. I love writing and watching shows alone. I need some of this every day or I get sullen.	I think the most unrealistic thing I am looking for in a relationship is just to have someone who accepts me and my interests 100% for who I am and what they are. I'm a nerd who loves purple and sparkles but also has a fascination with dark morbid stuff. I play video games, listen to classical, k-pop and death punk and I want a man who can handle that. They don't have to enjoy all those things too but I don't want to have to give anything I like up just because my SO doesn't have an interest in it. I'm sure some people have that in their relationships but I've yet to find it.	1
Ladies, what is the cringiest thing your SO has said to you in public? How did you react?	It wasn't something he said, but something he did. We were walking towards WalMart and soon as we reached the furthest end of the sidewalk... he SPIT on the sidewalk!? LIKE WHAT THE HECK. I immediately slapped his shoulder out of disgust. It was no hesitation.. We stopped right there and I was informing him you just don't do that. That isn't right. You do not spit anywhere in a public place, especially on a sidewalk.	My husband one time said to my very conservative friend and her husband, "My wife would make a good hooker." At that point I think he realized maybe he shouldn't have said that, so he decided to make everything better with, "Your wife would too." Edit: Wanted to add, I think he was trying and failing to tell me he thought I looked good that evening. Then thinking that it wasn't what he said that made everything awkward but the fact he hadn't also complimented my friend, he extended his kindness to her. My friend has never let me forget that moment. Needless to say, that was the first and last time we went out as couples.	0
For all my office working ladies, what is in your "survival pack" at work?	**In my desk:** makeup bag, toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, mouth wash, deodorant, manicure set, bobby pins, hair ties, brush, comb, full change of clothes, granola bars, soup, nuts, jerky, tea, condiments, umbrella, phone charging cord, ear buds, mirror. **My office provides:** Advil, Aleve, Tums, band-aids, neosporin, tissues, hand sanitizer, tampons, pads, and hand lotion.	- Tampons - Toothbrush and toothpaste - Copious amounts of tea - Deodorant - Painkillers - Hand sanitizer - Moisturizer - Allergy pills - Tums - Kleenex	0
What are some tactics you've used for dealing with some of the more subtle forms of workplace sexism?	I work in an IT department. It's primarily male Engineers, I am the only Communication major and the only woman. I am capable of fixing and handling just as many of the problems that come into our office as the men are. However, for some reason my boss only ever asks me to "tidy the office" or "organize a bit" while the men are allowed to continue working on whatever IT related problem they're dealing with. Lately when I've been asked to "tidy up" I just say, "oh you know, I think Jim is free right now" or joke, "It's Andrew's turn to do the dishes!" Slowly but surely it's been starting to work.	Quit my job in business to pursue something more radically feminist. I should say eventually quit my job in business and I'm roughly 3/4 of the way to being a midwife.	1
At what age were you the most emotionally unstable?	Aren't most people going to answer somewhere in their teens? I know I was not the most stable person at 18. Trainwreck of a first relationship with a girl who suffered from Bipolar/PTSD did that.	Between 19-21. I was clinically depressed, suicidal, in love with someone who was awful for me but I hated myself so much I needed to love someone. Crying all the time for no reason, lost a ton of weight because I stopped eating to the point that I passed out once in the street. It was a horrible couple of years.	0
How do you feel about your friends (male or female) who can't seem to manage to get dates?	>Does anyone else have friends that are always single (male or female) and can never manage to get dates? Yep >Do they talk/complain to you about it? Yep >Do you try and help set them up or give them (contructive) advice? I'm a socially dysfunctional crazy person who generally feels antagonized by the vast majority of people who show interest in her. >Do you feel guilty talking to them about it if you seem to do ok with finding partners? I feel guilty because I'd like to be more supportive but I'm just sitting there thinking "people are dumb, why do you want to date them?" 1 person who is truly important is better than 100 one night stands. At least that's my opinion, I also know people who hate close relationships and would rather just bang as many people as possible before they croak, which I'm also fine with.	I don't really think about it honestly. I'm not sure if any of my friends even *are* struggling. My poly roommate made me crazy for a little while because she had a long term boyfriend, a girlfriend, and was casually dating 2 other people and still would come whine to me that no one wanted her...shut up...	0
What is one thing you wish you could say to your SO but don't feel that you can?	I'm still incredibly attracted to you, but I wish that you would lose weight, because I am worried about your health and want you to live forever.	I need a baby. Like, soon. If we don't have a baby before I'm 27 I'm seriously worried that I'll have to divorce you.	1
To those who were bullied, how did it affect you?	I still have trouble believing that people mean it when they say anything positive about me at all. Compliments sound like lies to me.	Mmmm, I was bullied and also did the bullying. I think both were useful experiences. It's possible it helped me get to a point where no one bullies me (or can) and I don't really want to bully anyone either	1
What was your most "wow that's so not like in the movies" sex moment?	Trying to have sex under the covers is not nearly as smooth as movies make it out to be. Every time I've tried, we just ended up tangled in the sheets and uncomfortable.	Just any sexual interaction with men. Like anything that might lead into sex. Guys are terrible at flirting and always makes me feel uncomfortable instead of hot and bothered. I'm not 100000% sure on being a lesbian, which is what I think I am as of now, but sure as hell I'm a very picky bisexual when it comes to men.	1
What's the best argument *against* one of your social/political beliefs?	I'm a supporter of legalized prostution on personal liberty grounds. But the fact that Amsterdam still struggles greatly with its human trafficking issue despite being the paragon of legalization is worrying.	If there were arguments against my beliefs that I considered "good", I probably wouldn't believe what I do. Edit: to clarify: I'm not saying everything I think is airtight solid, but if there's an argument against them that I consider "good", chances are my thoughts on the matter aren't strong enough to consider it a belief.	1
I'll ask the difficult question here. Did Ross cheat on Rachel or it wasn't cheating because they were "on a break!"?	Not cheating, but sleeping with random person day after is highly frowned upon if you ever want to get back together.	Honesty Rachel is the worst character in that show. She doesn't want him, then wants him, then doesn't want him and then breaks up his wedding before deciding she doesn't know how she feels. I don't blame Ross at all for sleeping with someone else on a break because God knows how she'll feel or if she'll be with someone else the next day.	1
AW in the US, who will you vote for for President and why?	This election makes me feel like the oldest sister in Poltergeist when she gets out of the car and screams "What's happening?!?!??"	I won't vote for Sanders. I would vote for Clinton. The morbid right-shoulder-angel wants to vote Trump just to watch a shitshow, but I won't. If he's the nominee, I won't vote Republican, same with Cruz E: Enough with the PM's and stuff. "Sanders-all-the-way" is not the only acceptable answer	1
Ladies who got in shape, what did you do to get there?	Gradual changes. First, I added fresh vegetables to my diet and cut out sugary beverages. Once I got used to one diet change, I'd add another. Over the course of a year, I completely changed my diet and lost 35 pounds. Then I started working out and exercising regularly, starting slow with bike rides and yoga and working up to distance running and weight training. I've kept the weight off for ten years.	Work out. Anyone who tells you that there is any way to get in shape that doesn't involve working out is lying to you. There is no magic pill. There is no magic diet. No magic milkshake. Losing weight is not the same as getting in shape. If anyone ever wants to get in shape, they have to work for it. So that's what I do. The first time, my motivation was a screaming drill sergeant. The second was just because I wanted to be stronger and healthier. As for diet, don't eat less, just eat better. And definitely never fast. To work out effectively, you must take in enough calories. Calories are good. You need calories. They're what fuel workouts. Just make sure those calories come with the nutrition needed and aren't just empty calories. And keeping a regular meal schedule (no fasting!) keeps your metabolism balanced.	1
What is your ideal date with your SO?	I can't help you, all my ideal dates (and fortunately my SO's too) involve going outdoors and hiking or climbing.	Always remember to fuck first. You will be way too full and satiated and sleepy after 7 courses and wine. My ideal date would be hiking in the mountains somewhere, followed by a jacuzzi, sex, and a nap, then a tasting menu with wine pairings at a super intimate venue with live music	0
What crazy snack combos did you concoct as a kid? Do you still eat them?	As a kid I think I once put mayonnaise in vanilla waivers because I thought it might just be close enough to an Oreo. Yeah, I haven't eat that since.	When I was young I was dangerously underweight and always tried to eat more caloric stuff. I used to take one graham cracker and PILE on cream cheese to like a 1-1.5cm thickness. Instant cheesecake.	0
What's the weirdest object that has been inside of your vagina?	A popsicle, a candle, cucumber, travel size conditioner bottle, underwear, dagger hilt, safe edge of a razor, Mardi Gras beads, a cane, an umbrella handle, and a cigar tube. That all probably sounds super weird outside of context. So to clear things up, I work in the adult industry.	A stocking. I used to cam and a client would like me to stuff a stocking up there and slowly pull it out. I hated it. It was dry and felt awfully uncomfortable, even painful. I pretended to like it, though, of course. Had to make that money and stroke that male ego.	1
What is something you never understood initially, but suddenly clicked later on?	This is a horrible story, but in second grade i noticed this girl on the playground didn't have fingernails. I asked her why, and she said "my mom pulled them out, she said I didn't need them." Seven-year-old me was just like, "huh." When it finally clicked for me ten years later, I felt and continue to feel horrible for not realizing what a horribly abusive situation she must have been in.	Physical attraction. I thought a pretty face was it, and good hair and makeup was a done deal- nope! Body shape is important, and wearing clothes that accentuate it while independently exuding femininity has been a total game changer for me. ex: Bit of cleavage, feminine color> GOT t-shirt. I still like my Greyjoy tee, but it no longer comes up in the date wardrobe.	1
Pets in bed? Gross or wonderful and the right way to live?	i have no problem with pets on the bed as long as they don't compromise my comfort. when the dog starts taking up too much space or kicks me while he's dreaming or whatever, he gets the boot.	Gross. Maybe it's because I was raised in the country and cats always stayed with the other farm animals, and the dogs in the barn or the wash room, but I think it's just fundimentally wrong to let your pet into your bed. I've softened with the years and I can tolerate pets inside the living room, bath and kitchen, but not in the bedroom, I feel it's filthy and destroys all pegging order in the family. But again, that's just me and undoubtedly has to do with me being raised in an environment where pets serve a purpose beyond companionship.	1
Lesbians: how do you feel about straight ladies at gay bars?	I'm a bisexual and feel kind of uncomfortable going because I feel like I will be evaluated as not gay enough.	I dunno, the last time I was at a gay bar, it was as part of a bachelorette party for a straight lady. And it was the one club I went to during that bachelorette party where I could dance sexy with my girlfriend without getting all grabbed at by straight boys. As long as you do what I do in straight bars (have fun without acting as if you're attracted to people you're not attracted to, and turn them down politely, and don't treat other bargoers as if they are entertainment for you) I don't see the issue.	1
Moms of AW, what was the strictest punishment you've ever given your kid &amp; what did they do to deserve it?	Not a mom, but my strictest punishment was having my books taken away and not being allowed to go to the library before my brother's Saturday baseball games. It was usually for bad grades.	My four year old went through a phase where he would bite his older brother when he got mad. The usual tactics weren't working so I told him the next time he bit someone that I would bite him. Sure enough, he bites his brother the next day. So I took his little arm in my hands and brought it up to my mouth -he's crying, apologizing, begging me not to do it, but following through on what I tell my kids is important to me - so I bit him. Not hard enough to bruise him or break the skin, but it left a mark for about half an hour. And he hasn't bit anyone since! It was kind of surreal and I hated doing it, but it worked. A little empathy goes a long way!	0
Whats something men shy away from due to gender norms that you find absurd and impractical?	Skincare. Especially when it comes to dry skin. That shit is uncomfortable, and no one is going to take your man card away for moisturizing.	* In general, just liking stuff and being excited about it if it's not sports or killing something. * Pegging * Drinking "girly" drinks - we've even gendered our alcohol! You don't need to suffer through scotch if you don't like drinking peat, it's okay, have a daiquiri. * Wearing clothes to please themselves, or really engaging with fashion as fun. * Crying. * Asking for help, or getting the help/treatment they need. * Being the dude that stops perpetuating toxic masculinity. * Standing up against misogyny. * Talking about periods. Gender roles are the fucking worst.	1
Single women with few/no friends: Do you go out and do things alone? Where do you go?	Not a girl here, but honestly you shouldn't be worried that your going out alone, don't listen to what other people say and just have fun :)	I have a friend who has never had a boyfriend, and has few friends. She's just sortof a loner and is very shy and withdrawn but she doesn't seem to mind going out alone. She goes to movies alone, out to eat at restaurants she likes. I would go out alone and bring a book. If you're in the city it's not uncommon to see people out on their own. People notice you're alone less than you think. Also on the people making fun of you, they may not realize you find it rude. I make fun of my friend all the time for going out alone but she makes fun of me because I'll make her come with me to get snacks at the store.	0
What do you want to humblebrag about today?	My boyfriend is actually the hottest and most amazing guy I've ever met, and he's also incredible in bed, and he's just really awesome and smart and funny. Girls always check him out or get crushes on him, but he loves me and he's loyal to me and I can't believe I ended up with such a catch. I'm so insanely proud to be with him. I hope I marry him someday because I can't imagine my life with anyone else.	After being laid off, I received 3 job offers in a week. The one I ended up accepting is a 16% raise, more responsibility, better hours and in a lower cost of living city. I'm also continuing to get requests for interviews. I received 3 interview requests after accepting my job. It's a nice ego boost to be so wanted.	0
What's a typical work day like for you?	I teach English in Japan. I pretty much either play games with kids or talk to old people about their grandchildren.	I'm an actress so a typical day for me is wake up, stretch and do a little bit of yoga, then head over to the theatre for rehearsal. Depending on the show and my role, what I'm rehearsing can really vary. I might at some point have an audition to go to in which case I'm rushing around the city. I might have a waitressing shift depending on my schedule that day too. When it comes to the performances then I usually have a more free morning (when there's no matinee) and will either work at the restaurant or look for other auditions/take classes/meet up with other people in the business for coffee (or just friends of course) Basically no two days are the same for me	1
What are some "out-of-character" thoughts you have sometimes?	Whether I like it or not, everything I think is in my character. If I don't like something about myself, I must change it.	I often think about the fact that being hospitalised would temporarily absolve me of all adult responsibility, and fantasise about ways of achieving this. I used to consider superficial suicide attempts or a psychotic break, now I generally think drug addiction. I wouldn't do any of this. I'll continue to be a hard working little member of society who adheres to her responsibilities and doesn't do anything stupid. But it's a nice escapist thought.	0
Germophobes, what is something you see people do that makes you absolutely cringe?	I'm not exactly a germophobe, though I flipped shit the other day when my husband wanted to thaw chicken in the sink... But, I'm an allergy mom... I'm absolutely paranoid about cross contamination. My son is breast fed (he's only 5 months old), so it's my food I have to be careful of, but I've watched my mom butter a slice of bread and then use the same knife to scoop out jam. So the jar of jam is now contaminated. I worry a lot about stuff like that.	I don't know if this is a "germophobe" thing, but SNEEZE INTO YOUR ELBOW DEAR GOD PLEASE. It's so much more sanitary.	0
Do you support a friend who has done something wrong, like cheated on her SO?	My best friend was cheating on her husband, he found out, they stayed together. Whether she still is or not, I have no idea. I asked her to stop telling me about it because I can't lie if I don't really know. The only thing that REALLY pissed me off was she used me as an alibi a few times. Do whatever you want but don't drag me in to it.	I have and I'm glad. She fucked up (a lot) but we're best friends and I know she didn't do it to intentionally hurt him. I know that she feels a lot of remorse and was going through a lot of shit with not a lot of support. It doesn't excuse what she did, but I understand how it all happened and I'd hate to not have her in my life. Years later she was cheated on, but they worked it out. And now everyone is happy. That sounds naive and silly and I'm sure some people will be mad at this response, and I get it. I feel a bit bad about it too. But people do bad shit but it doesn't mean they're all bad.	1
If you have every been homeless, what was your experience like?	Was homeless for 5 or 6 months. I've said it before and I'll say it again now: Being homeless isn't hard. Being poor is hard, and made harder by being homeless. My experience wasn't bad. I had a job, slept in my car. Stayed late for the internet and a cafeteria food. Drove to Walmart at night to sleep. Woke up and hit the gym for workout and shower. Easy peasy. Plus, I show up first, leave last, looks good. Bought a house, got promoted. I recommend being homeless with a job.	I have been homeless, some days my friend offered me a couch to stay on, most days not.. I was an addict, so no one really wanted me in their home. Some nights I would stay at a bench, sometimes I would break into abandoned buildings. Hunger was usually not a problem, I was high all the time and I really couldnt eat. Some nights I was scared, some nights I was calm. It really depended whenever I got my dose or not. But when I missed I had paranoia, I was freaking out and I didnt know what to do. Everything seemed hopeless. Ive been sober now for two years, and I dont ever wanna go back.	0
Ladies who disliked their engagement ring, what did you end up doing?	I haven't been in this situation but if I were I would probably just delicately ask to swap it. It's just a ring at the end of the day and he shouldn't take it personally if you don't like it. You're the one who will have to wear it for the rest of your life!	I shut up and wore it because while I didn't love it, I also didn't hate it. The ring my husband picked for me wasn't offensively ugly, just really not my style. I stopped wearing the engagement ring some time after we got married and I now only wear the wedding band and told him the ring isn't really my personal style and I don't want to damage the rings (since they're not soldered together). Thankfully it wasn't a super expensive engagement ring or I probably would have said something much sooner. I still have it and plan on doing something with it in the future- having the stones reset into something else.	0
All right now, how often do you wash not-every-time items?	I am so foul that I don't even have a schedule. Just whenever I look at it and think, "Man, when's the last time this was WASHED?" And then I wash it. Towels and sheets get done the most out of your list. I never wash shoes. I need to be more on my bra washing game, it's kind of ridiculous.	I'll start. Towels once every week, sometimes two. Sheets about once a month. Pillows, I never wash mine but my husband's needs to be fluffed a couple times a week. I have never washed shoes unless they've been puked on. I wash my bras when they get especially dirty, usually every month or two. Almost never wash bathrobes, but we don't usually wear them much. Almost never wash other blankets unless there are visible stains. I live with my husband.	1
There are two sides to every story. Why would your ex say you broke up?	Because I was crazy and emotionally unstable. (Due to my partner being an alcoholic and refusing to go to AA.)	Because he was an unhinged, bad boyfriend. There wasn't much else to understand about things. I am uncertain as to the reason of the downvotes - he *knew* those things to be true when I dumped him.	1
We always talk about crazy exes...but when and why have you been the shitty ex-girlfriend?	Not me but my fiancés ex. She cheated on him, they broke up, then she went on to throw paint on his car. Like I thought the ppl who are cheated on did the paint throwing.	I've always been bad with texting after breakups. I'll just text whatever angry thought pops into my head. Multiple paragraph long texts. For weeks. I'm always embarrassed as hell after everything blows over.	0
Former broke ladies of Reddit: When more money started coming in, what did you buy or upgrade first? What was lower on the list? Did you start spending less in any category? Ladies who are still broke, what's at the top of your list for when things get better?	Honestly, because I was that broke for that long ... the first thing I did was buy a $25 dress from Target, which seemed crazy expensive at the time. I also got Chinese takeout. $30. It tasted like freedom!! I still bring my lunch instead of buying, but now I have end tables instead of milk crates and when I really want expensive fruit at the grocery store, I just buy it.	When I first moved by myself out of state, I was so poor I was buying groceries at the Dollar Tree & only eating one meal a day to stretch it out. The second I got my full time job, I was buying quality groceries. For reference, I'm an organic, grass fed no/minimal preservatives kinda gal, so shopping at Dollar Tree for me was just....ugh. Nowadays, I still ain't rich but when I do start making significant money, the top of my list is either renting a house or luxury apartment. I hate living in rinky dink apartments.	1
Ladies who live with your SO and pay rent, how do you divvy it up if you earn significantly less than he / she does?	If you are in a relationship with someone to the point of living together, IMO money becomes communal. We've had a joint account since before we were married or lived together.	Well, I can answer for utilities. We pay a percentage of them equal to our income. So like, if our total income is 100%, I make 70% of the household income and he makes 30%. So he pays 30% of the utilities.	0
How do you feel about pre-operative (or non-operative) traswomen in women's change rooms?	If I could be sure they weren't some dude trying to ogle women and/or flash them, I'd be fine with it. But reality is that there are too many perverts willing to do whatever to creep on women.	I don't give a fuck who is in the changing room, as long as they leave me alone; bio-female, trans-female, bio-male, trans-male, anything and everything in between. Straight males in the changing room is no different than gay females in the changing room (and I say that as a lesbian). Don't oogle me, don't make me feel uncomfortable, don't hit on me, let's all change our clothes and go on our way.	0
Does your partner use a condom as an addition to your own birth control product?	We both hate the feel of condoms, so we rely on the withdrawal method which has worked great for almost six years now. My man has super control so I'm not worried about an accidental pregnancy.	Yes, because even with the pill we are afraid we will be one of the unlucky who slip through the cracks and gets pregnant. We have had sex without the condom a handful of times though.	0
OkCupid users: what are your profile pet peeves?	"if you wanna know, just ask. ;)" ETA: "i don't like drama/no drama pls" = they cause a lot of drama.	-"if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best"...people are capable of being evil as shit. I feel like this quote has been said by serial killers who are in relationships. -Saying that a man must be X height and in good shape...but then saying real men don't care about a womans weight/figure. -Bitterness toward dating. -No pics -Says that they are only looking for friends. Then contacts me and talks about dating.	1
Has anyone long-term dated or married an SO that was less motivated/ ambitious/successful than you? How did it turn out?	Poorly, because his laziness drove me up a wall. He had "absolutely no idea" why his teachers hated him (he was a failed class clown), claimed they "gave him bad grades on purpose" (hint: that's not how it works) and that he just "couldn't get good grades" but he also "wasn't stupid". I told him very explicitly that I wasn't going to marry someone who had no chance of success or goals in life. He took it about as well as he could.	My husband is very much the laid-back, low-key compliment to my type-A ambition. That's not to say he doesn't have ambitions; he has a lot of things that he works toward that are important to him, but they aren't money-making or prestige driven. It took him a while to find the things that were important to him. We've been married for about three years and lived together for seven-ish before that. It's working out great for us. He has a freelance writing career and does some odd jobs and pursues his interests; I work in a career I love. I am the breadwinner, but he takes care of the house, makes me dinner and lunches to take to work and just generally takes care of me. I love it.	0
Women with male roommates, what are they like?	For reference: I'm a 30 year old single woman. I lived with a guy and 2 women for a year and a half. LOVED my male roommate. Totally respectful of common space, quiet (aside from a few drunken nights coming home ... but hey, we're in late 20s), considerate, paid bills on time, picked up toilet paper when we needed it, etc. Aside from cleaning up his beer bottles every so often, I never had to pick up after him. And cleaning bottles was more because I didn't want them on the coffee table. We had a cleaning crew come once a month because no one wanted to do the dirty work of deep cleaning the bathrooms and kitchen. It worked. I live with another guy now and he's equally as great. Cannot stand living with other women.	I live with three guys. We were all friends prior to living together, and we get along well, hang out fairly often and all that. My only issue with them is that they don't fuckin clean anything.	0
Women who have gone through menopause, what was it like for you?	Not me personally, sorry, but my dad and I have discussed the fact that my mother after menopause is no longer moody and doesn't lash out at people for innocuous reasons. My mother was a seriously difficult person to grow up with, mood swings is an understatement. Never crossed my mind that her temperament had that much to do with hormones. She's generally just far more agreeable and seems more content now. I wouldn't go as far as to say "happy" but she isn't so incredibly miserable with life anymore. It kills me to think that she had to live being that unhappy for ~40 years.	I am 45, I had to have emergency surgery just over a year ago due to an ovarian torsion. I had a large cyst on my right ovary, bit my left ovary had a huge cyst that flipped my ovary. The surgeon removed all of my left and 75-80% of my right ovaries. He opted to leave me the small amount of the one in order to not pit me on HRT. I went from having very regular easy going periods to holy shit is this for real so heavy I can't leave the house periods. They are irregular to say the least and in the past year I have had three of them last over 30 days! I have mood swings and hot flashes and really hate being a woman lately. And from what I understand this is just the beginning? Ugh.	1
How would you feel if your SO refused to buy tampons/pads for you?	I never understood why guys were so weird about buying tampons. As a cashier the only thing I'm thinking is that maybe you should grab some M&M's while you're at it 😂	I would buy my own because why couldn't I in the first place? That's not his responsibility, it's mine. And if he's uncomfortable with it, I wouldn't blame him. Periods are the worst and it's gross. But first of all, rule #1 always stay over stocked on tampons/ pads. Rookie mistake.	1
As a Brit I don't understand why Hilary Clinton is so vilified. Can you explain?	Personally I don't like her because my perception is that she has corporate interests in mind more than the wellbeing of the people.	Because she is a woman in politics. The men have done things just as bad or worse than her and they get praise, or at least arent as hated.	1
Ladies, what is your favorite way to feel sexy, either for yourself or for a SO?	Getting the puh waxed shaving my legs and soaking with a lush bath bomb makes me feel pretty great. Wifey likes to nuzzle my legs. If boyfriend #2 is in town I'll get a fancy pedicure for him. He likes feet and I like getting my toes done so it's a good excuse Edit: why is this getting downvoted?? Wife is aware of the boyfriends and she is also with them if there's a concern of cheating.	For myself: Do laundry, shower and shave, do some mild pampering, then roll around naked in clean sheets. For my SO: Thin pajama pants. I don't know why, but he loves them and I find them super comfortable. Everyone wins!	0
Ladies who live alone! What advice would you give to a woman who is moving on her own?	You need a plunger!! Maybe not immediately but there will be a day! Stock up on sick supplies because it sucks to live alone, be sick, and have to get off the couch to go buy soup and Advil. I have a separate checking account for bills/rent. Everything is set up on autopay and direct debits from that account. A portion of my paycheck direct deposits to that account so I never worry about having enough to cover bills. It's all automated and that takes sooo much stress out of life.	Buy a gun, train regularly with the gun. Have an emergency plan. And always always be aware of your surroundings.	1
What's something about you that people are jealous of, but it's not as awesome as everyone thinks?	My honesty 😬 most of my girl friends think it's cool that I can just tell anybody how I feel, little do they know I shit myself every time I'm straight forward because that shit can backfire on you REAL quick.	Some of my friends are jealous of the fact that I don't feel pressured to drink. I think it's a good thing too, but it's mostly out of fear that I'll become dependent on it like my father. I feel weird sometimes because I just have no interest in it, and most of the people my age are really into drinking. I just feel like the odd one out. I wish I didn't let fear overrule me and hang over me like some dark cloud ready to unleash a storm, but I just can't seem to shake it.	0
To those that went to an all-girls school, how do you think it affected you?	I taught a course at an all-girls high school a long time ago. Before I taught it, I was weakly opposed to single-sex education -- I couldn't see any benefit to arbitrary segregating people by gender. But teaching there was shocking -- the students at that school were completely unlike any others I'd ever taught. They were confident, engaged, and enthusiastic at an age when most of the kids I taught competed in the "I care less than you do" olympics. I have no explanation for why removing boys from the classroom would make act so differently, and if I hadn't seen it myself I wouldn't have believed it.	Honestly, the color scheme of the uniform affected me way more than the fact there were no boys. It did make my childhood harder than it should have been. I went to a school with boys from 15-18 and it was whatever. I'm gay and was never particularly interested in male approval, so YMMV if you care about that.	1
Where do you live and in what ways do you feel like you fit in with the rest of the population, and in what ways are you different?	I live in London. Like most Londoners, I like to complain about the weather. Unlike most Londoners, I like people.	I feel like a damn fish out of water here the only things people care about are their ~careers~ and how much money they god damn make. So this town is full of boring yuppies.	1
Do any of you ladies have a job that you enjoy so much, you actually look forward to going to work every day? If you really enjoy your job, what do you do?	I don't look forward to going to work every day. I'm tired a lot, and my job is high stress. But I *love* my job. I love the people I work with, and I love the intellectual challenges of daily activity.	I work at NASA and I train astronauts on biological experimentation techniques which they'll eventually use when they're on the ISS. Yay science! I love my job.	0
What company you used to love has really been disappointing you lately?	My VS bras used to last a long time. I know something changed over time because they're bras started to fall apart quickly, like in 1-2 months. I don't even bother with going in the stores anymore.	Apple. I used to love Apple and I had a mac before most of my friends did, but ever since they've become super popular the quality has gone downhill. It's a bummer.	1
What would you do if you were obscenely rich?	Buy a really nice place to live, give money to family and friends, give money to the place I volunteer at and I'd do a whole lot of traveling. I'd also do fun stuff like get a bunch of $50 bills and hide them in library books just to brighten random people's day's.	My family would never work again. I'd set up a shit-ton of low cost, no-kill animal shelters. Set up large animal refuges worldwide. Travel to sight-see, while rescuing animals from zoos and sideshows.	1
What was the worst mistake you have made at work?	On my first day as an intern, I moved my chair in a way so that the back of a huge bookcase would fall right onto my pregnant boss's desk. Luckily someone moved her out of the way. I quit the next day for unrelated reasons.	First day as an intern I dropped a body and scratched a $10,000 casket so I'm gonna lead with those.	0
When was the most inappropriate time you've been hit on?	In my best friends bed with her then boyfriend. All three of us immediately passed out after a rave and I woke up to him fondling my nipples. I wasn't shocked in the face of seeming harassment (this has happened to me before for fear of saying stop; fear of hurting feelings more than anything because I was much more timed then) but the disrespect aspect towards my friend. Not that she would care, anyway.	Well, once I was checking to see if a store was opened and this guy pulled up and asked me how old I was..... So I said 12. He looked me up and down and said "nice", then drove away. He was at least middle aged.	0
Have you ever assumed family member or friend's engagement wouldn't work out? What ended up happening?	My sister dated a guy for 3 years that I never really liked...i thought he didn't treat her right and he was kinda of a drama magnet. She was taking about how she wanted to marry him and all this. And then she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma like three weeks after telling me she hoped Eric* would propose. He dumped her after her first chemo treatment because it was all too much for him. He also cheated on her. There is a good chance she would have murdered him if she was well. /* calling him that because that's his name.	yeah.. my good friend got married in a hurry some years ago. a couple other friends of his and i made bets on how long it would last. marked it on the calendar. I won. he was a good guy, and she was a pretentious fluff of a woman. "model", or thought she was.	1
What is your "just being friendly" behavior? Something you do with people that you are just being friendly with but NEVER with someone that you are romantically/sexually interested in?	Mine got all crossed around somehow, so my casual friendly does hit a lot of more typical flirty behavior. My actual interest in someone, both romantically and those be my friend type crushes, reads as awkward, stilted, and vaguely something like I don't like them at all. I've spent years trying to reverse them back how they should be, but not much success. Essentially the stranger I am around someone, the more likely it is I have some sort of investment in them. My best guess is that my natural conversation style is flirty, but once I start being invested in the outcome my anxiety takes over and my normal conversational ease and confidence just goes right out the window.	For me, making friendly conversation is totally something I'd do with a stranger /someone I'm not interested in. I've been in food service for 10 years and "small talk" is just something that comes very easily. A regular I used to have said once I was the Queen of the Soundbite. :) though IN that small talk, I'd talk about inane things, easy surface things. I'll bring up the fact I have a boyfriend if it's necessary to the topic, but I try not to be one of those girls that shuts down a dude from even just a conversation by shouting out she has a bf.	1
What's the weirdest thing that an ex has done after the two of you broke up?	She hand delivered a sad, soppy love letter and a hand-drawn Archer comic to my house while I was at work. My mum opened it and laughed.	Tried to get me excommunicated from the Catholic church. I'm an atheist and was raised in a Lutheran family, so I'm not sure what this was supposed to accomplish.	0
Does your family make up words for things? What are they?	Bickens for our bickens. My sister had actually greeted me "hey how's your bicks". It didn't hit me until later that she asked me how my vulva was doing.	You know how cats get that hangy belly that flaps back and forth when they run? My cousins call it a "sack of woo". And when cats get scared and do that sideways jump thing? That's "chinky chinky". No idea where they came up with those. Edit: I love all theses cat belly names. Hilarious!	0
What do you do for supplemental income (i.e. not your main job)?	Nude modeling. Three hours sitting around naked,which is all I really want to do anyway, and I get paid $60 at the end of it.	If I do basic tech support stuff for my parents (help them with their iPhones, roku boxes, laptops), then they buy me stuff. It's a pretty good deal for me! Oh look, Apple just rolled out a new iOS update...looks like I'm getting a new pair of hiking boots!	1
Do you like guys butts? Why?	Yep. Wanna grab it. Wanna smack it a bit. Wanna bite it a bit, like a cookie cutter shark, leave perfect little round hickeys on it. Wanna rim it. Wanna fuck it if that's allowed. Just...butts man. Butts. Wanna do butt stuff. Gender of person has no bearing on my booty desires. They are pure. Edit- have been informed by my good friend I need to use the phrase "eat the booty like groceries"	First, it's not cool for people to be slapping your butt and catcalling. Those people are harassing jerks. Second, yes, there are heterosexual women on this planet. That means they find men's bodies attractive, particularly parts that clench and thrust during sex. Why this would be a question, or a strange idea, I'm not sure.	1
Have you ever pulled off a successful April Fools prank? What was it?	went trick or treating on april fools got some fruit a little candy and some pennies People were mostly confused but went along with it.	I faked my death. I had a bunch of buddies help me out. I supposedly got into a car crash the night before, friends found pictures of the same car as mine but smashed to shit, posted those online. I had to call it quits once my parents called me asking why they heard I was dead, and when my ex girlfriend called my friends bawling on the phone. I still think it was hilarious.	1
In your experience, what happens immediately after you say "no" to sex with a partner?	As a guy when I get rejected I don't take it personally and have learnt to be patient and understanding.	He goes, "Ok, no problem," and then we cuddle and watch Frasier, typically. The exact same situation occurs when he says no too. We're both pretty understanding of that stuff as we both work 60 hour weeks (totally different hours though) so it can be hard to coordinate that when one or both of us is exhausted or has to get up at 6am the next day.	0
Let's talk about the real highlight of going out on the town: What's your favorite "drunk girl in the bathroom" encounter?	Three bar flys crowded into the men's bathroom once while my guy was in there peeing. I was on my fourth strong Bloody Mary. He came out and was like those chicks goosed me while I was peeing! He had to pick me up and carry me away from the bathroom entrance before they came out. I was pissed.	I just really appreciate every time I've been in a shitty club bathroom where none of the doors lock right and girls stop what they're doing to hold the door closed so I don't have to struggle doing a weird leg thing	0
Women with autism: what are social issues you deal with that you're not sure men with autism have to deal with?	1. people telling me to smile all the damn time. i don't hear anybody telling stony-faced men to smile. 2. expecting me to be naturally comfortable with and desirous of holding babies thrust into my arms with no warning and to know what i'm supposed to do with them until i can give them back. again, i never see this with male relatives, nobody expects them to be interested in babies. 3. being helpfully told how i could be prettier when i didn't ask and did not previously feel self conscious! thanks >:/	I'm not treated harshly at all since most people can't tell that I have it. Most just think I'm slightly strange. Since the pressure to be social is ingrained from birth for women, in general, women with autism (at least higher functioning ones) get really good at mimicking proper social behavior by the time we are adults.	0
What's the weirdest thing you've ever talked about in a job interview? Did you get the job?	I come across as 'posh' and people tend to be very surprised at my (not particularly pc) sense of humour. I was interviewing for a job in a factory, and after many times I was asked whether I would be able to work in a 'male dominated atmosphere', I thought I would show the interviewer by telling a joke, as the many assurances were not cutting it. I ended up telling a dead baby joke to the interviewer. I got the job.	I thought my interviewer and I had built up a solid rapport so then I jokingly told him that he looked like Toby Flenderson from *The Office*. It immediately got awkward and he seemed kind of offended by it. I spent five minutes trying to backtrack and explain how looking like Toby was actually a positive thing and how he was very underrated as a character, then he told me to stop, and we moved on. I still got the job though.	0
How do you cope with being legitimately unattractive?	I just... "deal with it". Life is too short to stress about things I can't change. I realized I wasn't conventionally attractive in middle school and immediately worked hard on my personality. It has done me wonders! I put a lot more pride in my intelligence and accomplishments than by how much attention I get.	There's a flip side to that coin. How do people cope when they are legitimately attractive. Many become insecure because they feel they are successful because of looks rather than on competence. Many become obsessed about losing their looks as they age. Many won't get the job they want simply because they are too attractive. Many lose their looks as they age and will have no compensating qualities to fall back on. Many are in many relationships but none of them are meaningful - quantity does not mean quality. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder - despite being attractive - you're not attractive to everyone. Many are treated differently because of their looks which is not always a good thing. Beauty fades but dumb is forever. Being attractive is not all it's cracked up to be.	1
What is something that you thought was completely normal until you grew up to find that it isn't so normal?	I grew up in an old farmhouse that had an addition put on in the 70s, 20 years before we moved into it. I didn't realize that usually when people add new rooms, they also add new fixtures and remove obsolete ones, redo drywall, etc and so most homes do not have front doors that actually lead to closets or windows that lead to other rooms instead of outside. It's a fun quirk. I love that house.	(I'm a guy, but I think this still applies) My mom (pretty much the only woman in my life for a long time) has borderline personality disorder. If you have lived with someone, especially a parent, you know how bad that is. It has *fucked* with my perception of women for a long time, and I am just now getting over it.	1
How often do you initiate contact with your SO and come up with plans for the two of you?	We live together, so contact doesn't really need to be initiated. Before we were living together, we sort of fell into a routine of spending weekends and Wednesday nights together. I don't remember quibbling over who initiated contact.	From the beginning we never obsessed about who contacted whom and how much. We still don't. This was not the case with my other relationships. Best thing is when your mind didn't even go into the "am u trying too hard? Do I contact him too much? Will be run away if he thinks i am too interested??"	1
Ladies, is there something that you need to get off your chest? If so, what is it?	My mom passed away a few weeks ago and this past week my boyfriend of three years broke up with me. He cut off all contact with me and won't respond to any of my calls/letters. He said he didn't want to have to be there for me emotionally during this time because he needed to focus on himself. The only one who could make things better would have been my mom. Life is fucking unfair.	I don't have anything I need to get off my chest as I tend to say what I want when I want. One thing I haven't said yet as it is not the time I plan to is that I'm beginning to tire of my bf and will be replacing him with someone younger, hotter, and makes more money. I'm just waiting for me to get all his network contacts for my own use.	1
Who is the most charming person you've ever met and how would you describe him/her?	They make eye contact, they don't stutter when they speak, they use your name frequently in sentences, and they make you feel safe. Some feel that it's more of an outgoing characteristic- but personally, that can go to greasy used-car-salesman really fast.	My best friend from high school is absolutely charming. She is very outgoing, friendly, bubbly, funny and very beautiful. She can have a conversation with anyone and makes friends with just about everyone she meets. I think a lot of people associate the word "charming" with *superficial* charm, but I can say with certainty that there is nothing superficial about this girl, at all, she is just legitimately a good and friendly person down to her core. She's just also a magnetic personality that a lot of people want to be around. And I swear, she gets so many jobs she's not actually qualified for, just cause she's so damn likable.	0
What was the strangest thing you got downvoted for on AskWomen?	I argued that Marilyn Monroe wasn't a size 16. She had a 23" waist for crying out loud. That's a 00 these days.	Probably when I called out the question "What do you love most about him?" for being heteronormative and ended up with like 60 down votes. Edit: it was -44 down votes and the question was "What made you realize you loved him?" I said >"him"... >A question like this is asked at least every week and generally in a less heteronormative way." Edit edit: haha this is getting downvoted too.. Usually try not to mention that but can't resist the irony.	1
What is the most infuriating and frustrating argument you've ever had with a parent due to the fact that in the end, it was mainly about you being female?	A little late to the party and not entirely on topic. I'm a transgender woman and have always been very gentle/femme/soft/quiet. My parents raised me thinking I was a boy and were pretty contemptuous and intolerant of me not being masculine; I didn't play sports, I had zero interest in labor (such as helping my father and brother dig up tree trunks in the garden or build things), I had zero interest in rough-housing, I watched shows like Next Top Model, Fashion Police, and Sex in the City. Long story short, I didn't participate in a single traditionally masculine activity without being actively blackmailed/threatened into doing so by my parents. The funny thing is, my father always wanted a daughter. I shudder, looking back, at how I would have been raised if I'd been born a cisgender woman. My parents were pretty heavily invested in enforcing gender roles.	Every time my brother could be out at all hours of the night when he'd banged most of the girls in his social circle, but I wasn't allowed to be with my friends because "there are boys in that group!" Eventually I started going out whenever I felt like it, because fuck that. Still never banged my friends, still never got myself (or anyone else) pregnant. Can't say the same for my brother.	0
Women 40+: What is the best thing about getting older?	Well, I'm 52 now, so I'd say boning younger men, especially twenty somethings (their skin is so soft and their muscles just sooooo hard) lolz. Realizing that the old chestnut "if they ain't feeding you, fucking you or financing you, don't you pay them any mind" is TRUE.	I'm in my mid-40's and the best thing about getting older is that I'm more comfortable in my own skin than I ever have been. I wish I'd felt the same way when I was younger, but I was very insecure and had low self esteem. Now I recognize my qualities and realize my self-worth. Also, I have a heck of a lot more money than I had previously and that's definitely a plus.	0
Why is your pet a jerk?	For the love of God, rabbit, please stop humping my leg. My leg is not another rabbit. You cannot procreate with my leg. Stop it.	I have been super excited about getting my daughter's homeschool room set up. I finally got help moving things out and cleaning it yesterday. I got to hang posters, organize supplies, and finally hang the brand-new bulletin board that I am so excited to decorate later this week. Except when I go in this morning to admire the room, I see that my cat decided to use it as a scratching post and it is destroyed. I wanted to cry and kill him. I know this isn't such a big deal really, but I have been scrimping and saving for all the things we need and that was my little- not so needed- fun item. I still have other things we need worse so I won't be able to replace it for a little while. Fucking cat bastard.	1
Mentally Ill ladies, how do you cope?	Generalised Anxiety Disorder - Originally therapy to get a better handle on things, but (probably not what you want to hear) ignorance these days. I pay attention to my own signs, but I'm so petrified of anyone else seeing me as broken I have perfected the art of the "mask". I am the duck. Everyone sees the serene tranquil duck floating on the water. I don't let anyone one see how frantically I'm scrabbling underneath to maintain that facade.	Very interesting question... but IMHO, I think we're all mentally ill to some degree. I'm one of the most genuinely happy people you'll ever cross in life, but have been seeing different therapists since i was 7 years old because of OCD related to a relentless phobia. If i'm being honest, therapy didn't help me much. *Connecting with other people, talking and listening to others share their vulnerabilities, that's what truly has helped me.* OCD, GAD, 15 years	1
What has been one of the most uncomfortable social situations you have been in?	when I have to ask a male Prof or TA a question and start blushing. I can't help it, men make me blush.	Nearing the end of my senior year of college, I once found myself at a rooftop party with my then-boyfriend and, somehow, every guy I'd ever been involved with in my four years there. Thankfully I was drunk enough to not feel tooooo much discomfort. (Edit: there were other people there, of course)	0
What's the toughest hurdle you've had to get past in your marriage?	Trying to deal with my husband's huge penis. I mean, that thing is enormous, and satisfies me like nothing else. But jeez, enough is enough, sometimes! Some days, I'd be okay with having less than a dozen orgasms in a row. Edit: Oops, meant to post this from my wife's account.	My SO's mom. She was cool the entire time we dated but around the time of our wedding she freaked out and got really awful, particularly toward me. He practically worshipped the ground she walked on, though, and most of the time it was like 'I agree with you but I've done all I can.' Eventually though she pushed him too far in a really transparent way, trying to get manipulative, and that changed his attitude entirely. She moved 1500 miles away and he stopped giving a shit what she thought about us as a couple.	0
Ladies, what situations do you have no pity for?	People who assault police officers. Cops are doing their job by enforcing laws to keep people safe. If you can't respect authority figures, think you're above the law, and think it's okay to threaten bodily harm or assault them, well, that's on you, buddy. You deserve whatever you get. Everyone wants to cry "POLICE BRUTALITY!", but the fact of the matter is, assaulting a cop is a felony. Not to mention, if you were being assaulted, wouldn't you fight back and attempt to restrain that person? I know I would. EDIT: Nice to know the consensus supports harming our police officers. All I can say is, "WOW". Keep it up, and we won't have a lot of police officers left to keep us safe. SMH	People who spend their money frivolously and then complain about being broke... I want to say - If you didn't spent $10 every day on lunch then you wouldn't be so broke. They have all of these choices yet it's always someone else's fault and so many end being my co-workers somehow. I chose to live alone and I have less spending money but I think that is worth not having a roommate. My co-worker chose a luxury apartment instead of one of the many safe, cheaper apartments in the area and loves to complain about how broke she is. See above - she also spends quite a bit on lunch and somehow I should feel sorry for her when the day before payday she has to go cheap and get McDonald's (and she still orders a more expensive meal instead of dollar menu items). No sympathy for that crap.	0
What sexual information regarding the intimacy of you and your s/o would you consider too far over the line to share with your girlfriends?	Anything specifically about him rather than me. So, "we tried X and I loved/hated it!" is fair game, my girls and I are very open about our experiences. But if I was to say anything about *his* preferences, or things he isn't willing to try, or describe his body (intimately, not just general physique), well...to me, that's crossing the line. I'm the only one who should know those details unless he chooses to share! (Mind you, I'd discussed this with my SO at the time, so he knew we were so open and was okay with it, even if he didn't quite understand why.)	My BFF of 20 years both acknowledge that we each enjoy sex with our partners, but we don't divulge a lot of details. When we were both younger and dating different guys, we both had more horrible, funny, embarrassing things to share so we talked in a little bit more detail. It's different now. She's known my husband for 15, and I've known hers for 10. When I lost my virginity at age 19, she was the first person I told. When she dated a guy with a micropenis, I heard all about it. Sex with long term partners isn't quite as amusing as all the shit we used to see as single ladies. When we do talk about sex, we laugh about all of the old stuff.	1
When you were broke (or if you currently are), in what ways does/ did it "cost a lot to be poor"?	One of the biggest ones I remember was being too broke to afford a bus pass so I'd have to pay the fare everytime. I'd spend way more every month than a bus pass (especially because I would have got a student discount on the pass) but I didn't have enough for that upfront purchase.	My mom makes $90,000 a year working as an R.N., which was too much money for me to receive financial aid for college. So, I had to take out the loans for my $26,000 yearly tuition. I get that she makes a lot of money annually, but how is she supposed to give me 30% of her annual income to go to school?! Luckily, I got grants for grad school.	1
Females, how important is the bottom 1/2 centimetre of a man's left earlobe to you when dating?	I love pointing out men with bad earlobes in public, and then laughing at them with my girlfriends because they're such creeps and they'd never, ever stand a chance with us. And when I do spot a man with a good earlobe, I like to surreptitiously reverse-pickpocket my hair bands into his pockets to mark my territory so other females know to keep their distance.	What the fuck did I just stumble into? Man the 9th page of /r/all gets weird. I really should get ready for work.....	1
Women of Gonewild...why do YOU do it?	At first it was because someone threatened to leak my pictures, so I beat him to the punch. Then I realized it turns me on to know other people are turned on by me.	Not my thing, but you might go ask the guys of LadyBonersGW too (i.e. it's not just women who do this).	1
What was the most uncomfortable event during a family gathering you witnessed?	I've seen lies about me happen, and also when my (now divorced) cousin grumbled about christmas cards being for christians n god is bad etc to my (mentally ill) uncle..... nan requested the cards back. No money was in the cards.	I have a couple good ones: 1. My brother brought a stripper he was dating to our family dinner at my grandma's house. She had a panic attack at the table and ran out of the house, yelling "you're all just too normal for me!" 2. At my wedding, my aunt and uncle made the decision to get divorced. They then hit the dance floor and had their "last dance as a couple," complete with crying and sad kisses.	0
AW: What are *you* aroused by and why?	Really awesome dude-scent. Like some men smell so amazing. Deep voices, especially when they get all whispery. Teasing. Competence and confidence combined with genuine kindness. The ability to make me laugh. Nothing makes me develop a crush faster than a good sense of humor.	Good singing and dancing. Never knew why to be honest. A girl who can sing can damn near have me do anything she wants. Also girls who do robotics and are good at math and cs.	1
Mothers of reddit - why exactly am I not supposed to sit on the arm of the couch?	Not a mom, but I just bought my first couch and it's something about not wanting to make it bow or otherwise compromise the structure over time. (That's what the person selling it said anyway) ...And after realizing just how dang much furniture costs, I completely understand why my parents freaked out over things like using coasters now. Furniture is important and expensive.	I'm a mom and I sit on the arms of the couch. My husband says you're not supposed to sit there or put weight on the back of the couch because it could break, but he might be full of it.	1
If your pet was the star of a Pixar movie, which famous actor would be playing its voice?	David Attenborough would be my cat's voice. He is an old man whose only joy is looking out of the window for hours at a time (briefly interrupted by morning meal, evening meal, and snack time). He would narrate the whole movie as he observed the intricate drama of the backyard squirrels and blue jays. At the end of the movie he would leave the window, shaking out his stiff joints, and discover that I was sitting on the part of the living room couch he considers "his." The camera would dolly in on his face as the audience absorbed the tragedy of old age.	Willen Dafoe, but with helium added so it's real high pitched voices Migde, and anxiety ridden 17-lb mutt. Special appearance by Ray Liotta, who will voice my baby/Midge's partner in crime. Midge would be trying to take over the world, but all attempts would fail as she continually would get distracted by crumbs and granola bar wrappers. Baby would continually get annoyed with Midge, only to laugh hysterically at her obsession for food. I imagine small vignettes of her failed adventures instead of one, feature-length film.	1
What is the biggest criticism or annoyance you have about someone but can't tell them either because it's not your business or because it'd be inappropriate?	I have a coworker who is sickeningly sexist both to men and women. It is damaging her career and she seems to think her deep understanding of the genders makes her stronger instead of disliked by many. I don't tell her cause she wouldn't listen anyway so what's the point.	If you want guys to stop thinking you're into them and trying to get in your pants, then I would highly suggest you s*top blatantly hitting on them and flirting like a fourteen year old!!!!* I'm a little tense.	1
Women who are fit, how often do you work out?	I exercise in some capacity 7 days a week. I do yoga at least 5 days a week, sometimes more. It varies from a slow flow to vinyasa. I do kickboxing once a week and go for a run 2-3 times a week.	What do you mean by 'fit'? I look really fit. I have really good muscle definition (obliques, sometimes other ab definition as well, crazy calves and very toned arms) but I'm not in peak physical condition at the moment because I haven't worked out properly in over 6 months. I'm a 'naturally fit' kind of person, so I can probably still run a pretty good time on 10km and lift a fair bit for my size, even tho I feel out of shape for me. I used to dance and I think it set me up pretty well. I still walk everywhere (maybe like 5km a day?), but beyond that it's pretty much no exercise for me. Don't really diet either, but I'm not prone to overeating.	1
Women of Reddit, what game do you consistently play, and why?	I've been playing Stardew Valley pretty consistently since it came out. I used to play harvest moon a lot back in the day so I was super excited when this came out.	Mostly I play with the emotions of unsuspecting young men, but I like word puzzles, cryptic crosswords, sudoku, and old school board games like Cluedo or kerplunk.	1
Women who've gone from overweight to fit: How did you do it? What finally motivated you?	Respectfully, I do not conflate losing weight with "fit". I am overweight, but am incredibly fit and strong. As a dancer and dance instructor I can run circles around women much skinnier than I am. Fitness /= lighter weight.	I had always been slightly to very overweight, and when my daughter was born, I decided I was going to make sure I lost the baby weight. I started exercising every day, using the elliptical and a couple dvds I found at TJ Maxx. By the time I lost all the baby weight, I had become addicted to exercise. I just had to find what I liked, which was exercise dvds. I lost almost double the baby weight and I've continued to workout, and I've kept the weight off for the past seven years. I weigh what I did in eighth grade.	0
How would you feel if a guy you liked slept with your friend?	Would tell both of them to fuck off permanently. I have no time for people like that and their shit.	What is my relationship with the guy? If he's just some guy from the other side of the office who I think is attractive then I'd be like... High five, hope you had fun. If it was a guy I was friendly/friends with who I was growing feelings for then I would be kind of jealous and sad. I mean, that wouldn't be my friend's fault though. I'd probably pretend to be fine with it. You don't get to claim ownership over someone just because you like them.	0
Whats the most dangerous thing your child has done?	I laid my son down for a nap in his crib when he was 18 months old. He climbed out of his crib (had never done that before) and then climbed onto a rocking chair, up the back of it, and then pushed out a screen and went out the window. The window looked out onto the flat roof on the mud porch of the house. My baby was on the roof. My neighbor saw him and banged on the door. When she told me, I ran upstairs and yanked him back in. That was one of the scariest moments of my life. He's 15 now :)	When he was about 4, he pulled his hand out of my mother's and ran across a lane of the parking lot. After that, my mother and I had a short but intense discussion about how she actually has to *hold* his hand and not just rely on him gripping her finger.	1
Ladies with partners, is there something that bothers you about them that you have or will never mention? If so, why?	I certainly don't plan to marry any time soon, but my partner would really like a diamond of some kind on their engagement ring, and I would just much rather make her one myself (I have experience in fine metal working and have a lot of jeweller friends to help) and I just don't like gemstones on rings. I really don't have problems with my partner (except slight incompatible love languages, but that's more my fault)	He is so relaxed about things like planning and communication. His entire family is. Getting him to make a concrete plans is like pulling teeth.	0
People who were reasonably pretty but became uglier at some point later in life: what happened and how did you deal with the change in appearence?	Honestly I think I've always been very average looking, but I *was* thin, blonde, and white. Since freshman year of college I've put on about 40lbs, and I'm still very average in terms of size (I wouldn't even call myself chubby, not because it's inaccurate, but because I wouldn't want to co-opt chubby girls' struggle, if that makes sense?) But wow, there was a clear turning point of me being fuckable to one day I wasn't. It doesn't like, bother me? In fact I think it's a fascinating exercise in privilege. Because I look basically the same, I just have some chub (and my personality is *way* better lol). So yeah.	I was attacked and left with large and obvious facial scarring. I've come to love my new exterior self - mostly because the inside person hasn't changed. She's the same badass she's always been.	0
Do you often feel unsafe because of your gender? Why, or why not? Were you raised to be careful because of being a girl?	>However, I think it's because he was not raised as a girl and did not grow up being treated like you were a target because of your gender. Men are much more likely to be targeted for violence than women.	Starting in middle school, the girls (and just the girls) were pulled out of gym once or twice a year to learn about self-defense, every year. Part of this included lectures about not going places alone at night, always checking your car in case someone was in it, being aware of your surroundings, etc. I went to college in a sleepy, low-crime college town, but both the men and the women got constant talks about never letting women walk alone at night, always calling on a male friend or campus police officer to walk with you, admonishing the boys to always offer to walk a girl home, etc. It was drilled into our heads A LOT. So I never think, "I am unsafe because I am female," but I was very much taught to be careful because I'm female in specific ways that men definitely weren't.	0
As a father, what should I not neglect to teach or do for my daughters?	Do 'man stuff' with her. Are you repairing the door lock? Putting a bookcase together? Even things like replacing the shower head, get her to do it! You do not need a penis to use a screwdriver and own a toolkit.	"It's not a father's job to teach his daughter how to be a lady, it's his job to show her how a lady should be treated."	1
You've been given the job of making a list of five things that mean someone "has their life together". What would those five things be?	1. Not be broke by their own doing. Some people are, unfortunately, poor, despite budgeting well, but I wouldn't say they don't have their life together because they are poor. 2. Being able to handle their own personal flaws. 3. Knowing their likes, dislikes and preferences and being mindful of those. 4. Doing whatever they can manage to do to be healthy (again, some people are just unfortunate). 5. Knowing what they want out of life, whatever that might be, and working actively as far as their limits allow towards it.	1) Has a fitness regimen 2) Has a well-stocked kitchen with minimally processed foods 3) Has an understanding of where their assets are & what expenditures their budget allows 4) Is very rarely late for appointments 5) Says few negative things about others	1
How did you overcome your addiction, and what were you addicted to?	I'm a meme addict. I've been addicted since 2011, and it's troubling me. I can't have a normal conversation with anyone. I'm always shouting memes and drawing them in class. It's a serious issue and I haven't been able to get over it.	Shopping. It sounds kind of petty when people here have struggled with serious stuff like drug addiction. Shopping really puts a strain in my life as I spend on things that I don't need and that don't make me happy outside of the moment I'm doing it. I would like to travel and spend more on experiences that actually make me happy but I see a sale and somehow I lose control and immerse myself in this sea of material junk.	0
The US Treasury today announced that they are replacing Andrew Jackson on the $20 with Harriet Tubman. What are your thoughts on this, if any?	Trade a NDN killer for WoC?? YES. YES. AND YES. I've lived so far to see a black president and now Harriet Tubman on a $20, you bet I'll be saving one of those for sure! Next up a NA persons or Brown person. WATTBA.	I'd like to see a Native American woman replace Andrew "Hmmm that Trail could use a lot more Tears on it" Jackson, but I'll take Harriet Tubman. It's good to have someone on our most common distributed denomination of currency that actually fought back against oppression instead of institutionalized it.	0
Ladies in a relationship, what is one thing your SO has expressed he/she would like you to do, but you know there's no chance in hell that you'll do it?	Sex without condoms. We've had this discussion 3 or 4 times since March (I got Nexplanon) and each time I tell him firmly, No. I'm not comfortable going without condoms. Yesterday he asked me via text message (after I had just told him no the night before) and I told him that him pushing the issue made me upset because as far as I was concerned, the answer was and still is no. If he wants to have sex without a condom, he can find someone else or use his hand but the answer is no and he needs to drop it.	I'll try almost anything my husband asks, but he told me he wants 12 children and that's something I'm inclined to say no to. At least not biologically. If we adopt a bunch then sure, we planned on adopting anyway in addition to biological children.	0
how would you feel about your SO packing/making a lunch for you everyday when you go to work ?	I love that idea. It feels very traditional if you will. Sexist? I don't know but my opinion is my opinion.	I'm still a student so I've yet to hit that point but my parents do this for each other every night. Their lunches the next day are usually a reconstruction of dinner leftovers, so they do this thing where they each propose the easiest yet tastiest way to reimagine the food and whoever's idea is best doesn't have to do it haha. So the person with the bad idea ends up making the good idea, if that makes sense. They'll end up switching off if one of them routinely has the better ideas, just to keep it fair. I think it's cute.	0
What's something men insist is true that you just aren't buying?	This one might go counter to a lot of opinions on here. But there are a lot of men that feel that women need to be protected. I actually think that's flat out wrong. If anything, men are the one that need protection. Men have much more violence inflicted on them than women. Whether it's war or at a local bar. Oh, and of course men commit suicide more often, are less likely to go to college, etc...	'Men can't make noise during sex because years of masturbating quietly has conditioned them to be totally silent'. As if women are masturbating to screaming orgasms as teens in a house full of parents/siblings??	0
Women working in male dominated fields, what is the worst thing a male coworker has said to you?	I worked in construction for a couple months. The worst was my coworker telling me about all the prostitute sites he's been on and seeing if I'd be interested in something with him. The worst part was once I put in my resignation my manager declined the validity of my statement and that even women ogle guys like Brad Pit. And that he was sure all the guys considered me like a daughter. Then he gave me an awkward hug. I was so pissed. The owner gave me my two weeks off, paid.	Worst? That's a tall order - I've had almost exclusively positive experiences in my professional life. If I had to choose, it'd be "hurry the fuck up, we don't have all day" as I was churning out something for a deadline. Not even bad at all, he says things like that to all of us, it wasn't directed at me as a woman at all	1
What are some of the downsides/meh aspects of long-term relationships?	The realization that you've given them all the best years of your life and gotten next to nothing in return.	I wouldn't say it's a downside, so much as a reality: if you're together long enough, at some point one or both of you will face hardships (e.g.: job loss, illness, grieving, stressful situations, etc.) that may impact the relationship and where you require the other's support. It's something people may not be prepared, willing or able to deal with. It's easy to enjoy the good times and look forward to the happy times ahead, and you should, but the reality is that life throws you curveballs and if you're in a LTR the curveballs life throws at your partner may impact you as well and vice versa. How you two get through those curveballs helps shape your relationship and can ultimately strengthen it, but you do have to be prepared and willing to work through and ride out those difficult times.	0
What are the signs or red flags that a guy is only in it for the sex?	Usually the signs seem to involve them wanting to see you only when they feel like it and being really pushy when they do and about having sex. If all he does is want to meet you at his place or somewhere away from everyone and all he does in that time is try to initiate sex and he makes excuses to leave when he's got what he wants that's probably a definite sign. Some might be a bit harder to figure out but if in general it seems like you are their little secret then they probably don't think much of you and are only sticking around for the sex. Any relationship I had where it wasn't just sex they wanted to be out in public with me and show me off. Guys tend to love making sure everybody knows they have a girlfriend lol.	Guy here. Just wait, don't be specific about X number of dates or anything, just say you want to feel comfortable or something. Don't hold out on other means of affection, and consider getting pretty far without p-in-the-v so he won't wonder if you're the one playing him. MEANWHILE: Does he bring you around his friends? How does he treat you around his friends?	1
What weird part of social interaction do you genuinely not understand?	I think it's silly for us to keep archaic customs that no longer serve any purpose whatsoever. Do we really need to shake hands? You're no longer assuming I'm concealing a weapon if I don't hold my hands out. Do we really need to "bless" someone who sneezes? We don't think they're dying of the black death, or in danger of losing their soul. I think it would be great if our society could figure out how to move on and stop bothering with things we really don't need to bother with any longer.	How to deal when you see an acquaintance from afar you haven't greeted yet, and both of you are walking towards each other. What do you do during that part of the walk where you can't talk to each other without raising your voice too high? I always pretend I don't notice them until the last second, and then I go "hey! How are ya?" only to not be able to talk to them at all until the next day.	0
Ladies; when was a time you tried something to be sexy, only to have it backfire?	This happened to my ex-gf, not me. We were going through a pretty long sexual dry patch that was maybe just due more to lack of communication and different sensibilities. She initiated kissing and feeling one night, and then excused herself to her bathroom. She came out in a leather-y S&M-looking outfit, and I just wanted to laugh. For one, that look isn't really my thing, although I can imagine some scenarios where that look can be sexy on some women. But *on her*, it was just too out of place and I couldn't wrap my head around why she thought I would want that. I felt terrible because she just took it off immediately as soon as she saw my expression. I just didn't see her that way.	I was riding him in platform heels, span around to do reverse cowgirl....clonked him in the penis. That or the time I tried to spank him when he was bent over and instead hit him straight in the balls. I am catastrophically clumsy and he's a trooper.	0
What's the worst lie anyone has ever told you?	I'm a guy but: "I'll wait for you" after I went to do my conscription. Turned out she had another guy a month in. She even tried to get back together with me saying: "After you told me you were wounded, I thought you would die, I can't wait forever." "I called you and told you I wanted to see you in the hospital, and that it was a bullet to the arm ffs!"	There are too many to choose from with my dad. "I did check with you about the funeral date, don't you remember?" "I did visit you in the hospital. I brought you lunch. You don't remember?" "I was never unfaithful to your mother." "I can't pay for school supplies for you. Your mother has all my money." "I treat you this way because I love you more than your brother." He's a pathological gas-lighter. It doesn't fuck me up as much now as it did when I was a kid.	0
Ladies, how have you been unintentionally creepy?	>but it's really applicable to anyone who was/is socially clueless at some point! No. Stop claiming it's about social cluelessness. It isn't. Creepy is not the same as cringey or awkward.	When I'm walking my dogs through my neighborhood, and I pass a house with it's blinds open I've caught myself watching the people inside. I won't stop or get closer or anything, but I'm fascinated by strangers, and can't help myself.	0
Speaking of Disney films, who do you think is the true villain in Beauty and the Beast?	I think Gaston gets a bad wrap. His only character flaw is that he's arrogant. That hardly makes you evil. Sure, he's old fashioned when it comes to gender roles but many women are as well. He's pretty much the only person in the town who likes Belle and even though he has bimbos throwing themselves at him, he like the girl with brains. When he hears that she was held captive by a monster he goes to get rid of it. He goes through dark scary woods and into a cursed castle to fight a monster who kidnaps innocent people. Put Gaston in green and it's basically Legend of Zelda.	The sorceress. Who changes an 11 year old, and _every member of their entire household_ to punish them because an 11 year old bratty prince didn't let her in when it was cold out. For that matter, if maybe he was really supposed to be older, why punish _his servants_ when this happened? No wonder he got resentful and LESS trusting of people over time, look at the crap that was done to him and everyone who worked for him.	0
Non-white women of AskWomen, do you feel that society identifies you more strongly by gender or by race, and in which ways?	I'd like to see how this is broken down by class. A lot of working class women I know, who don't have a ton of education and don't work professional jobs, seem to feel race is more of an issue for them. My more educated friends, who do have professional jobs or work in white collar settings, feel their gender is more of a barrier.	Race. I'm biracial, although ethnically Hispanic My accomplishments, failures and behavior will be attributed to my blackness. My blackness will be attacked before my womanhood. I can only get a job or get into college *because of affirmative action* and the fact that I'm *black* If I get angry, I'm an angry *black* woman If I sleep around, I'm contributing to the lack of family unit structure within the *black community* When I'm told I'm pretty, I'm "pretty for a *black* woman" That's just how it is... EDIT: Without fail, the commentary regarding affirmative action and the insinuation that we can't get into uni without it are rolling in.	0
What is the most memorable, in a good way random encounter you have had with a stranger who you haven't encountered since then?	At universal studios years ago. Was dragged by my parents on a tour group filled with old people. I was the only person under 40. Sitting on the tram waiting for the tour to start there were people all dressed up as characters from movies. I was miserable and must of looked it. Frankenstein came up and shook my dads hand, growled at my mom and looked at me. Then he walked away to the hill beside the tram. He came back a few moments later with a tiny bouquet of windflowers. He bowed in front of me and handed it over. I didn't stop grinning for the rest of the day. Frankenstein made my 13 year old heart stutter :)	I was in a new town (eventually moved here) walking down the street and this guy was running the other direction (like working out) and said he liked my necklace. I smiled and continued my walk towards this business, and as I get there the guy shows back up! All out of breath, he asked me out to coffee or drinks. I had a boyfriend at the time, and he was super respectful about me turning him down. I just thought like, wow, this stuff isn't supposed to happen in real life!	1
What's your 'the one that got away' story?	Our mothers were friends, so we grew up knowing each other. In high school we were both interested in each other, but too dumb to say anything or read the signals. I moved away for university and the next year he enrolled at a university 20 minutes from mine, yet still nothing happened. The last time I saw him he showed me a giant canvas and said we should paint something together. I feel like it was a Nicholas Sparks romance novel waiting to happen, but now we live on different continents.	I met her at a concert for one of my favorite bands, it's to date the only time I've ever gotten a date with a stranger I've met in public. We had the most romantic date I've had, we went to a Beer-Wine-Cheese-Chocolate tasting room, then we walked around the park, and right as we kissed for the first time the sprinklers came on. She was beautiful, she was intelligent, and she was driven. I fell head over heels and got way too excited about things. One night I was a total creep and came on too aggressively. I stopped as soon as she said she wasn't interested, but I'm pretty sure that I ruined things that night. I still think about her and I really regret acting the way I did and leaving her with only knowing a shitty side of me.	1
What's a strange thing that keeps happening to you during dating?	ALL of the people I've ever been involved with or fallen for, ended up coming from families with serious addiction baggage/are children of alcoholics, and all of them have strong issues around substances. Every one of them. I hope my luck will change now that I'm a medical weed user, haha.	For some reason, the topic of hentai always comes up. I mean Just because Im an anime enthusiast doesnt mean Im into cartoons banging. :(	0
What hobbies did you pick up in your 20s-30s?	Knitting, big band music, banjo/bluegrass, gypsy jazz (for those last three, listening to. Not playing. I have what they call "dumb fingers" and "laziness"). There might be some other things, but that's all I can think of atm	Gardening is probably the most enjoyable hobby I've taken a liking too in my early 20s. I always adored my grandma's garden. It was a two-tiered garden and she cared for it meticulously. So much green, so many beautiful flowers in a rainbow of colors. So having my own house I kinda felt like it demanded me take some time to beautify it the best I could!	0
What hobbies are you interested in and want to try, but are too nervous/hesitant/need convincing still?	I wanna start weight-lifting and training, or maybe take some sort of martial arts or self defense class. Basically, I want to be tougher but I don't know where to begin!	There are things I would like to do that I don't have the time or money to get into, but I can't think of ever being too *hesitant* to try a new hobby.	1
What criticisms do you have towards modern feminism as a movement, if any?	As a man, I find there's a lot of hypocrisy in today's feminism. I also feel that there's an entire subset of "feminism" where the only goal is to tear down men. It's not so much about achieving equality for both genders as much as it is promoting women as superior to men in every way. Stuff like that creates conflict, and keeps us apart instead of bringing us together. I also don't like how there's no room for dialogue on this issue. We should all be able to talk about this subject and express our opinions and share our experiences and have a healthy discussion overall. It would do more for the movement than anything else. But if we're going to write off every man or every oppositional view as misogynist, wrong, old fashioned, offensive, etc, we won't get anywhere.	The fact that most feminists don't seem to appreciate/understand that there are many schools of feminist thought. I'm tired of people who think their understanding of feminism is The One True Feminism.	0
What has been your most bizarre interaction with a redditor?	Someone posted a question asking if I would ever shave my head, then PM'd me and offered to fly to my city and pay me to shave my head, then said he would bring his girlfriend as if that was insurance that they weren't going to murder me.	Somewhere I do believe I asked someone not to call me a "female" because it dehumanizes me and women in general - he wouldn't say "some of my friends are male" - he used "guys" - but he was saying "some of my friends are female" so... I got this amazing hilarious screed about how I was a fat, forever alone redheaded feminazi. I'm still puzzled at how being redheaded might be insulting….	1
What is something rude people do without being aware of it being rude?	Folks who aren't aware of the physical space they take up. I've always been really tall and somewhat insecure about it so I think I have a hyperawareness of this, but when folks back up into people or are waving to friends and smack other people/almost do in the face or are fistpumping at concerts or take up the entire sidewalk with their friends *with no regard for everyone around them* it makes me SO mad. Just...be aware of where you are and where other people are around you. PLEASE.	Apparently, when somebody who is more senior than you at work screams at you from across the kitchen, you're supposed to say "Yes ma'am?" instead of asking "What do you need, (Name)?". Worked with an older black lady last year who read me the riot act for not giving her "respect" because I would yell back (as politely as I could, considering she was on one end of the kitchen and I was on the other) "What do you need?". Apparently, it's also rude (or rather, it was according to her) to like "black" things like certain music, certain TV shows, etc if you're not black. o.O That I didn't know.	1
Have you witnessed or been a part of a random act of kindness or pay it forward type of situation and what was the experience?	A guys credit card was refused when he was trying to pay for his car tags. He came up $0.75 short on cash. I gave him a dollar. Can't tell you how many times I've given gasoline to strangers to get the to town after they run out in front of my house. I always refuse to take money, telling them to pay it forward.	I was at a Bernie Sanders rally a few months ago. It was super crowded and the media/tripods/cameras were obstructing a lot of views, but I could still see him. I heard an older couple next to me complaining they couldn't see him, so I offered to switch places with them so they could get a look. Reluctantly, they agreed. After about 10 minutes, they switched places with another person who couldn't see, who switched places with another person. It was pretty cool. edit: spelling	0
Ladies who got married very young/ straight out of college, what are you experiences?	Married at 20. Divorced at 21. Married because pregnant though. I would not recommend it. Honestly, I don't think anyone under 25 should be allowed to get married.	I got married at 20. We were both very religious, we didn't live together before our wedding, and we were both virgins. We divorced two years later because he was abusive and I drifted away from organized religion when I was told that God wanted me to stay with my husband no matter how badly I was being treated. I'm a very happy single atheist now, a decade later.	0
What's the most uncomfortable confession of interest/a crush that you've been part of, whether receiving or giving?	I was in class in high school finally asking my long time crush out. It took me two semesters to build up the courage to ask him, and the girl sitting next to me kept interrupting me, and asking me the same questions I was asking him. Since it wasn't going exactly as I had planned it in my head, I just stopped talking mid sentence, and turned around in my chair. Luckily he caught on to what I was doing, and made me finish my questioning, once the chatty girl was distracted by something else.	When we were in high school, we were pulling an all nighter(to study Maths) with a group of girlfriends at a her house, which is on 7th floor! We heard a knock on window! Being so curious and dumb, we opened the curtains and saw a boy from our school, telling me he loved me! He even had roses! It turns out, he called firefighters, begged them to drive all the way there and let him use the ladder to help him tell me he loved me... And they actually went with it! My friends and I had a good laugh after the initial shock and fear went away... But boy oh boy, it was weird!	1
What is your advice for making a relationship work in the long-term?	As far as I know this is a relatively newer concept but when you end up living together, keep separate rooms. You don't need to smush all your stuff together into one space- it's actually healthier for you two as individuals to retain your own private sanctuary when you need alone time. You can always sleep in one or the others bed together, but it's good to have your own space in a relationship that's all about togetherness you know? And to echo everyone else, appreciation and continuing to "date" each other. Making sure to get dressed up and go out on dates every few weeks is important. Communicating and "learning how to fight" properly so to speak and express yourselves healthily without making it personal and attacking them. Expressing appreciation for them.	Communication, try not to assume your partner knows exactly what you're feeling. And never stop dating your partner or falling into a comfortable lull, because then it starts to feel like two friends just living together.	0
What is your best advice for job-hunting?	When handing in your resume, make sure to ask to see the manager and give it directly to them yourself. This allows them to put a face to your name and gives you the opportunity to introduce yourself.	Your experience is going to be something like this: NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO *YES* Remind yourself, after the tenth NO, that no matter how many NOs you are getting, you only need one YES.	0
What is the best or worst thing you have overheard someone say about you?	The best thing my kids told me was that I am an awesome mother and my husband told me that I am the love of his life.	Best: that I make people feel at home 😊 Worst: that I had gained weight and was weighing my car down. Kinda funny, but still hurt my feelings.	0
Ladies with breast implants - how did your life change, for better or worse, post-surgery?	My wife got them a year ago. This morning she came to me and said "It is nice looking at myself in the mirror". She went from having to sloppy hotpockets after 3 breastfeedings to perky 75D's, and to be honest, it is the best 5k€ I have ever spent. She is much happier with her body, and is a much more comfortable being. Bonus-edit: Best thing about them is that I get to buy a lot of sexy lingerie to her - I average one nice set per month that I buy for her. One of my favorite activities.	Only changed for the better. I had no breasts. Not even AA. I come from a long line of tiny, breastless women. So I got B cups, and I have been happy ever since. I felt like such a child without them. I hardly felt like a girl. I am not ashamed of them at all. If it comes up, I proudly tell people I have implants.	0
I'm a very emotional Male; what is your cutoff between endearing and "being a baby"?	It's the same for me man haha. I cry on many Movies/TV Shows. The last episode of The Office, just damn. "Michael I can't believe you actually came" , had me in fucking tears but totally worth it. As a guy, I think being emotional makes us experience the world in a different way, so don't be afraid of it. I haven't had a girl tease on me or tell me off for crying on something like that :)	I'd say the cutoff is crying at everyday annoyances. 'Spilt milk' level stuff... that's just too much for me to deal with. I cry at every sad part of every movie or tv show or podcast, so I don't judge about that sort of thing.	0
What is something you kept from your parents as a kid, but later told them in your adulthood?	That I dated in high school. She got angry that I had done that and went off on how irresponsible it was of me and that she told me over and over not to because it's a bad thing to do. Then she asked why I never told her. "because look how you're reacting! Why would I have wanted to tell you?"	Honestly, I'm pretty sure my parents knew everything. Even the things I *thought* I was keeping from them, they managed to know about. I was also a goody two-shoes, so nothing I did warranted hiding anyways. There's only one thing they never found out about, and I'm taking that secret to my grave.	1
What is your opinion on people who use the terms, wifey, hubby, and fur-baby ?	Whatever floats their boat about the first two. Fur baby. .. as long as they don't legitimately think it's comparable to a real baby in difficulty and whatnot. It's not. So not. Omg not.	Don't like them in particular, but not offended by them. I do hate, however, stuff like DH, DS, DD. Stop.	0
What kind of posts/comments remind you that Reddit is mainly composed of Americans?	Whenever people ask "Where do you buy your jeans/make-up/undies etc." I'm 90% sure my answer won't be relevant since a lot of places I shop aren't in the U.S. (For example I buy my undies at M&S, my jeans at Next, and my fave eyeliner is from Barry M.)	Whenever someone asks a "who is your favourite comedian/actor/musician/celebrity?" The answers a almost all Americans (particularly with comedians, it's crazy to me)	1
Mother's Day in Canada. Anyone find this day depressing/have a difficult or bad relationship with their mother?	Today, at the restaurant I work at, an elderly couple waited a few hours for their daughter to show up for their mothers day brunch and she never came. It's definitely a hard day for a lot of people.	So, in case anyone needs a little extra support dealing with awful parents or you'd just like to know you're not alone, /r/raisedbynarcissists is a really great place to go. The mods are good about shutting down intrusions from any difficult people you may be trying to avoid and everyone is really friendly. You'll be surprised how many other people share your experiences. Mother's day is pretty difficult for a lot of us. I just sat through a two hour dinner (that I paid for!) of near constant complaints from my mother and knowing that I'm not alone made it survivable.	1
When you gave birth, what's one thing you wish someone did or gave you?	I just wish they had inserted the IV correctly in my arm instead of puncturing the artery all the way through. I also wish they had inserted the epidural correctly so it didn't just paralyze my left side and leaving my right side able to feel everything. And privacy would have been nice. Since it was a complicated labor that took 43 hours I ended up with about 20 different people staring into my vagina as if it were some mystical oracle of the future.	My mother in law came about 2 weeks after the birth. She cleaned our house top to bottom in all the public areas - living room kitchen dining room guest bathroom. It was amazing to go into my sparkling kitchen after barely being able to keep up with emptying the dishwasher. I still talk about how shiny my sink was. Our house has never been so clean.	0
Bar tenders/baristas, what is your least favorite drink that people order? Why?	This is a bullshit thread. It's all people complaining about easy as hell drinks to make and complaining about how they have to take a few extra steps besides serving a beer/coffee. It's like a chief complaining about someone ordering a meatlovers pizza with pineapple. It's your job to make drinks: if it takes more work you charge more and make more, what is there to complain about. That's the job! If you don't like it get another job jeeze	Anything that gets made in the blender. I'm assuming this goes for both bartenders and baristas. It's noisy, it takes longer than just shaking a drink, it's honestly kind of difficult to make sure you're going to get great consistency on the first go no matter how experienced you are (I swear, 3 ice cubes too much/too little can throw a whole drink off), and then it's a pain to clean. I also hate making anything that I've never heard of. Sure, it can be a fun challenge with the right customer, but most of the time it's someone who had something on a cruise with a made up name, and my close approximation isn't close enough and they send the drink back.	0
What is the dumbest thing you've cried about while you were on your period?	My boyfriend said I'd used up all my kisses and that I wouldn't get anymore. I was so upset, it was insta-water works even though he was clearly joking. He still teases me about it	Why condescending questions like these get upvoted when we are trying to fight the idea that women are irrational during their periods? I certainly never cried for something stupid on my period, or felt that my emotions were out of control. And then we wonder were people get their sexists assumptions. Sigh.	1
What do you do if you realize another woman triying to steal your boyfriend?	Chill out and watch her make an idiot of herself. (I don't "protect" my guy from other women. He's either with me or he isn't.)	I went through this recently. My girlfriend got insanely jealous over a girl I had zero interest in. It was too much. I broke up with her. You have to play it cool. It's okay to be jealous. It's not okay to act jealous.	1
What was the defining moment that made you realise your S/O was "The One"?	I'm a man but I don't think there is a "one." I think it's completely random who you end up meeting and you may or may not find someone you can spend your life with. And if you do, it may still fail after a period of time. There is no magical right person made specifically to compliment you. Sorry	For me, it was actually the other day. We had gotten into a mini argument a few minutes before, and I wondered out loud if I was worth it for him because I know how stressful my mood swings and irritability can be. As soon as I asked if I was worth it, he started crying. Began telling me that he didn't understand how I could ever think I'm NOT worth it when I'm everything to him, when I make him feel happier and more loved than anyone else ever could. I started crying too, and I couldn't be more sure.	0
Ladies of reddit, what do you think of facials?	I'm scared to do facials because my skin can be reactive. I'd hate to pay so much for rashes or breakouts. I like hand and scalp massages. Anywhere else massages put me on edge. I don't like people touching me. I do like heat and I am tempted to see if the hot stone massage could bypass my touching issues.	UGH. Im bummed that the NSFW interpretation of "facial" was the first thing I thought of when I saw your question. Cause the NSFW facials are so depressing and awful. Don't like em. Don't know any woman that would like them. Degrading. Doesn't seem fun. But getting to YOUR question: I'd love a facial! I just had my first pedicure the other week and it was so wonderful. I'm sold and look forward to getting a facial soon too - I'm sure they're fantastic:)	1
What's the strangest thing that a therapist has said to you, or suggested?	A therapist thought I was genderfluid once. I have no idea how she came to that conclusion, as I'm pretty solidly female.	He told me that my feelings were driving my thoughts, but my thoughts should drive my feelings. Basically, my depression was my own fault and I could just think it away.	1
Which "signs that a girl likes you" are absolute horseshit?	Eye contact. I understand it to an extent but I don't think anyone should rely heavily on that as a sign. If people are comfortable in a conversation generally there is eye contact.	Blow jobs. Just cause she blows you doesn't mean she likes you. She could be bored or just a pity blow.	1
In what ways are you a massive fucking hypocrite?	I always think other people should confront their difficult issues with friends/family/partner head on, but *I* never fucking do. Your friend is treating you like crap? Just tell her, you don't have to put up with that shit. Am I going to do that if it happens to me? Hell no. I will fume in silence and hope she just works out what she did wrong. Edit: fucking hell this blew up while I was asleep. Glad I'm not the only assertiveness hypocrite out there.	My husband is totally cool with/encourages me to see other people. I would most likely be a mess if he wanted to go on a date with someone else. I'm not that bad with my other partners but damnit my husband is MINE. I turn into jealous trash when it comes to him.	1
How do you plan to raise your daughter(s) in regards to sex?	I would raise her to *hopefully* understand both the pros and cons of sex. Teenage boys can be jerks and if she is anything like me, she will fall for them and trust them when they say they love her, just so they can get her into bed. Thankfully I have only slept with 2 people. One guy after high school graduation who I had dated for almost 6 months. We broke up after because I did not want to be with him forever. The next guy, my husband. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak by not sleeping around. But, in the end, it's her body. And it would be my job to teach her about birth control, STD's, etc so she knows all the "facts".	I think I will likely raise either gender child with the same guidelines for sex. Basically it will center on the importance of respecting your body and how the purpose of sex is to bond yourself to the person you've chosen to marry.	1
What is an assumption foreigners make about the people from your country but you are/do very different than their assumption?	Not all Canadians are polite and nice. And they don't realize that the bagged milk and certain pronunciations are regional things. And they underestimate how varied our geography and climate is. We do say eh and sorry a lot though	That American food is all hamburgers, hotdogs, and pizza. Our cuisine is eclectic, drawing on many different cultures and putting our own spin on it. These 'bastardizations' as some people call them are valid in themselves. Also in my part of the country people are incredibly polite. I'm from Florida and I kinda hate Georgia (the state) because they're so rude and nosy. Edit. Florida's actually quite sane, the reason there are so many crazy stories about Floridians is because the police are fast and lose with arrest records and the press can get to these stories without the consent of the people involved. Your state is just as crazy as mine, your police are just a bit more tight lipped.	1
What are your home maintenance and cleaning hacks?	I just don't. No, I should take the time to do my dishes every night and wipe off the counters, I know it. But I don't. I'd rather spend a Sunday morning, music loud, and clean the crap out of my house.	Here is the best tip I've EVER learned: Set aside 10 minutes every night to do some cleaning. I mean it. 10 minutes only. Set a timer and clean until the dinger goes off. You'll be surprised how much you can get done in that time-- picking things up, cleaning the toilet or wiping off the sink really quick, throwing dirty clothes in the hamper, emptying the dishwasher, whatever. Don't start anything you can't get done in 10 minutes. 10 minutes is the STRICT LIMIT. Things like loads of laundry or floor-mopping can be done on weekends. But every weeknight just do 10 minutes of quick cleaning and you'll be shocked at how clean your house is most of the time.	0
Ladies, what makes you feel an emotional bond with your SO?	Good conversation! I always start to feel like I'm losing a connection if we have the same conversations over and over, but I feel really good about the relationship when we actually discuss something new, no matter what it is.	Firstly, you have to make sure you don't fuck too many guys or you'll lose your ability to pair bond completely and you'll be consigned to being a cheating nympho for the rest of your days. /s	1
What's one aspect of being adult you found weird/never anticipated?	This may be small, but birthdays. As an adult, birthdays do not entitle you to special treatment simply because of the date. You're not 11 anymore. Act like it. People who think that they deserve special treatment at work because it's their birthday make my eyes roll. Seriously. You're 27. Or 35. Or 40. Get up and get to work on time. No, you don't get to shirk duties or get everything you want because it's your birthday. You're an adult. Act like it. It's just another day. It's different if your friends and co-workers want to do something for you. But when you demand special treatment or get pissy because you didn't get something special, that makes you look like a child in my eyes. Grow the fuck up.	I thought that I would naturally get better-looking when I got older, because everyone kept telling me I would "grow out of" things like acne and awkwardness. I waited for a while and eventually I just looked a bunch of stuff up on the internet and tried it to see if it helped. It did. It turns out you have to actively participate in making your appearance adultlike. Hmm.	0
Have you ever lost respect for your longterm SO or spouse? Why? Were you able to regain it?	Yes. Unfortunately. About a year after we started dating I found out he was sending sexually based messages to a "friend" he met and casually saw before we met. He told me it was over and that he wasn't going to speak to her anymore. I found out several months later that was a lie and it had continued. He just hid it better. I lost respect for him and his honesty. We are still together and its been a few years already. I've slowly regained that respect but it has taken a lot on my part to really try and put effort into the relationship and him. I think I have less respect for the "friend" than I do for my SO. Mostly because she knew we were dating and I'm guessing she just didn't care.	Yeah, because I came to the realization that things that were important to me meant nothing to him as long as he got his way. I had sold things to keep us afloat when he was in a rut that he always promised to replace, and never did, all the while buying himself new things. Also the way he ranted about how all Christians should die and his lack of apology when I pointed out that some of our very good friends were Christian. No, I didn't regain it. I decided I didn't like him as a person after that.	0
What is the bare minimum of self-care that a person should do for themselves during a rough patch?	I'm not a woman, but as a very feminine man I like to think that I have a woman's intuition ;) I think the bare minimum would be showering at least 3 times a week, brushing teeth at least daily (you WILL regret getting a cavity), and some form of mental stimulation. In certain cases it's unrealistic to expect somebody having a hard time to keep up with the discipline of healthy eating and exercise, but if you can you should. Whatever your problem is- Don't worry, it'll get better. Probably.	Showers and brushing your teeth in the morning and at the end of the day. Those damn dentist bills can really add up. :\	0
What was it like the first time someone close to you died?	Pretty awful. I shared a room with my grandma and I woke up with the sound of her calling me. I went to her bed and she whispered "I can't breath." I went to call my mom, as we got close to her again my mom said "quick call an ambulance" and my grandma replied "no I'll die on the way there." And she just passed away. It really got to me, I was 9 but I remember it so well.	I was sad for about an hour because I wouldn't see them anymore. I then moved on. My family was appalled at my short lived feelings of loss.	1
What do you love most about the city you live in?	I live in Deltona FL. I am only about a 25-30 minute drive to the beach and some of the best quesadillas I've ever eaten.	That I can drive in any direction and reach either the ocean, mountains, forest, or desert in under 3 hours.	0
What's the worst first date you ever had?	I was set up on a date by one of my coworkers. I'd seen most of the people who work at the store we worked at, so I wasn't too nervous. It's important to note that I was hardly 18, and had expressed to her (whined, really) that I had never had a boyfriend or been on a date. So, I start texting with this guy she thinks will be just perfect. We decide to meet up a week later, at some restaurant. He was 27, had a kid and is currently on a break with said kid's mom. We talked about dogs and work. We parted ways amicably, and I never answered his follow up text. A month or so later I heard through the grapevine he got back together with the kid's mom.	I went on a Tinder date in January that went poorly. At the end he tried to kiss me so I dodged, tripped over a curb, and broke my fibula while falling into traffic. The guy got down in the road with me, moved my hair behind me ear and said "we could tell people that we fell in love".	0
What are some red flags you missed in the early stages of a relationship due to chemistry?	He really liked his alone time. Before we lived together, we'd spend 1-2 nights a week together. Never more. After we moved in together, he still spent a lot of time without connecting. TV, video games. But only rare moments of quality time still 1-2 times per week. Being with him was lonely.	His jealousy. I thought he really liked me and wanted to spend a lot of time with me. He was just trying to make sure no one else would steal me. He was very possessive. Even after we broke up.	0
What is a relationship dynamic you don't like, but that you consider necessary to the overall health of the relationship?	Pretending that I care about things that I don't care about or find stunningly boring. Sometimes you just have to suck it up and listen.	I personally cannot stand that some people just keep complaining about work. "Oh I've had SOOO much to do today and I'm totally swamped and I'm gonna have to stay in the office longer and omg so much to do" My SO tells me it's normal for people to complain about work, but all I hear is: "I can't manage my own workload/tasks so I'm gonna reveal how terrible I am at my job". ...what?! I feel like I'm the only person happy with their work.	1
What is the stupidest or most pointless free gift you've ever got with a purchase?	I hate pens! I'm up to my ass in bird pens and flower coasters from British Red Cross. At Ryman's once the cashier asked me if I'd like to donate to Sports Relief, so I said okay, and then he told me to take a free pen. And I refused and he kept insisting. So finally I took a pen and I can't even use it because it has a rattle on the end of it. And they're always blue ink, why are they always blue ink? Black is so much better. Argh.	I bought a >€1000 handwound wristwatch from Stowa in Germany. When it arrived, it included a Stowa-branded cheap plastic tumbler, like you might get your drink in at a carryout pizza place.	1
What's the weirdest most bizarre thing you caught your SO doing?	Ugh, NOTHING, I'm ALWAYS the weird one. Dammit. Watching Akira, maybe? Or I've woken up to him watching movies on his phone with headphones next to me	He disappeared for a few minutes longer than usual when he goes to the bathroom and the toilet had already flushed so I got up to see what he was getting in to. I walked around the corner to the bathroom and see him standing in his boxers inspecting one of my tampons. I watched him silently as he tried to figure out how it worked and his face when he pushed the applicator and it popped out was so hilarious I started laughing and he saw me. It was so hilarious.	0
Ladies, what lies are your friends/acquaintances living on social media?	My MIL constantly reposts stuff about Parent Alienation. She lives in this magical world of denial that her ex-husband kept their sons from her when in reality she had done so much fucked up stuff to the family (she cheated, did drugs, kicked her own kids out forcing them to live models, etc) that her sons wanted nothing to do with her and chose not to see her for years.	This one girl I went to school with is travelling at the moment and her posts are all "on the beach! love life! seeing the elephants in thailand!" and that feels sucky for all of 2 seconds until you realise she is sinking money into something she cannot afford on account of her job prospects being zero.	1
Women: What are some things your ex boyfriends/husbands did that creeped you out looking back?	He lied about his age. I was 18, he was 35 and said he was 27. He told me jokingly I was too old for him a lot when people asked about the age gap. He often would comment on girls being pretty and they were always too young...younger than me. He's now on the offender list.	Was dating a guy and on the second date, he asked me, "How do you act when you're mad?" That should have been a sign to run. EDIT:// He turned out to be controlling.	1
What is a stereotypical personality trait in your society that gives both good and bad results?	People in Turkey live their emotions at extremes. This causes people to be incredibly generous and helpful, including to complete strangers and tourists. But this also causes overreacting a lot of times. Basically whatever you give, positive or negative, you get it x3 back and people can go from very angry to love you like a sibling in like 20 seconds.	Country with the world's most beautiful women (Colombia) Positive: sure, I can see it. The mix of different races and ethnicities makes for more interesting facial features Negative: people think women are "only" beautiful, and in certain circles expressing intelligent thought is met with surprise and shock	1
What experience have you had with a health practitioner making an inappropriate comment to you?	I was having immense stabbing pains in my abdomen. I have an IUD so I was worried it was potentially migrating. I went to the ER because the pain was so bad I couldn't move or walk and was in tears. The doctor (who was not a psychologist or psychiatrist) looked at my chart, noticed I had some psych history, and went on this long rant about how depression makes us do bad things - really guilt tripping stuff - and then said that the depression was probably the source of my pain. He refused to even investigate more, despite me curled up, moaning in pain. I managed to get another doctor in who gave me an ultrasound and discovered that my ovaries were riddled with cysts. Fuck that first doctor.	Well one of my male doctors would not stop looking at my legs. I was wearing like mid thigh shorts. Another massage therapist at my acupuncturist office asked me like four times to come in for a massage sometime and wouldnt stop ooogling. Ahhhhh	1
What are your three biggest red flags for a new relationship/friendship?	* How they treat others. It doesn't matter how nice someone is to *me* -- if they're ever unnecessarily rude, harsh, or judgmental towards other people, then that's the real them and that's how I should believe they'll treat me once the novelty wears off or I inevitably do something they don't like. * If I ever feel that I need to walk on eggshells around the person, change myself in any way, go out of my way to seek acceptance from them, etc. * If they say or do things that regularly has me feeling embarrassed around others, having to make excuses for them, etc.	Addictions, whether that be alcohol or drugs or gambling. Personality disorders - ie psychopathy, sociopathy, narcissism. I have to be very careful as this are exactly the kind of men I'm attracted too. DAMN.	1
Do you have a lie or a secret in your life that you feel like you have to dance around? Will you tell us about it?	The fact that I have such lingering mental issues. It's not that I'm SECRETIVE about it, it's just that I know people would begin to treat me differently if they knew. Mostly my colleagues. It's kinda embarrassing to talk about and they're pick-of-the-crop type guys.	Nah. Lies take too much effort and I'd rather do fun stuff. I'm also not cool enough to have major deep dark secrets.	1
How did you find out that your SO was cheating on you and how did you confront them? How did they react?	Met a girl in one of my drama classes in college. We became friends and she mentioned this guy she'd been seeing. I asked her about it. Turns out it was my boyfriend. She thought I was going to kick her ass, but like, why? It's not like she knew he had a girlfriend at all. She was as angry as I was. We went to his dorm room together and knocked on his door. His face when he opened it was fucking priceless.	Late to this one but I had a high school girlfriend who not only cheated on me but after we were broken up I found an article she'd written online titled "How to cheat on your boyfriend and get away with it." I printed it out and gave it to her current boyfriend, with whom she had cheated while she was with me. He cried. Ten years later and I think they're married.	1
What is a small thing that annoys you beyond all reason?	I'm beginning to get annoyed at "what annoys you" threads. They all have the same answers. Loud chewing, people who walk slow, turn signals, slow drivers, bad grammar and spelling. There. Thread over.	I hate when I'm unloading the dishwasher and tip over a dish that had trapped some water, sprinkling all the previously dry dishes underneath >:(	0
What gross thing has happened to you recently?	At KFC with a colleague and while talking with her mouth full she spits out some greasy fried chicken skin onto my white shirt. Couldn't rid the stain by the time I went out with friends that evening, however I think the bar lighting saved me.	A bird shit on my leg while I was walking around yesterday. Since it had rained recently, I thought it was rain, so I tried to use my other leg to wipe it off. Instead I got bird shit on both my legs.	0
Childcare workers of AW, what's the most inappropriate thing a kid has ever said to you?	I was watching my sibling and the neighbor kid when lil bro said "If {niece} doesn't learn to share I'm going to punch her in the vagina" He was ~5. I wasn't even mad, could just laugh. When asked where he heard that he said "mom."	Last year a fourth grader told me he was going to sneak into my room, kill my parents, and get me pregnant.	0
Women who wanted children but dreaded pregnancy, how did it go for you?	I felt great pregnant! A little sleepy at the beginning, and huge at the end but other than that totally fine. I taught over 10 ballet classes a week until the day before I pushed my little girl out at almost 43 weeks....I did completely lose my mind between 41 and 42 weeks. I honestly thought I might be pregnant forever. But I wasn't, labor was quick and doable and now I have a little wild girl. My brightest light.	I had my first (and only kid) at 33, up to that point I hadn't wanted children, damn biological clock! I knew from the get-go he was a boy and it was going to be an awful pregnancy. I had a multitude of medical problems, in and out of the Mat wards, saw every single consultant going and had a rough time. I had a 40 hour labour, his head was stuck in my pelvis and he was wedged against my back, I had an emergency c-section in the end. Never again. Edit: I was pregnant for 42 weeks, I felt like an elephant and I was going to die pregnant.	1
Fellow retail workers: What was the most wtf thing a customer has ever said to you?	I had a woman returning a dress that she purchased and then decided she didn't want. She told me I needed to give her gas money for her having to drive back out to the store to return a dress that had nothing wrong with it. I had a guy try and guess my cup size while he was buying a shirt for his girlfriend.	"what do you mean there is no replacement part for this 60year old pen"? -old dude "The company that made those special pens doesn't exist anymore" -me "surely you have some stock left?" -_- some people need to be cleansed from the genepool	1
When have you realized some of your friends are actually kind of shitty friends?	When we'd hang out and they'd spend the whole time talking about themselves & not a take a minute to even say, "So what's up with you?" Seriously if you only text me to talk about yourself, best believe you're getting a one worded response.	Quite regularly. When my mood is low I regularly feel abandoned. I have to think for a good few months when I think this about a friend to ensure I'm right.	1
When you played pretend as a child, what were you doing? who were you being?	I don't know about anyone else, but for me (in no particular order and not an exhaustive list) * Aliens * Superheroes * Mermaids * Mythical creatures * Astronauts * Jungle explorers * Warriors * Scientists * Witches * Secret agents * Detectives * Native Americans * Tree spirits * Magical * Gladiators * Pioneers * Gods/goddesses/heroes * Book characters/in book worlds	I was usually playing house, or being an animal. Playing with my dolls was not cultural programming, nor was I encouraged to do so by parents, friends, teachers, or other adults.	1
Women of color, what is one thing you wish the general population understood but seemingly doesn't?	That interracial racism is real. Some races can have many privileges over others. So as everyone seems to belittle this to having a "pissing contest on who has the shittiest treatment", that is actually true. Some races have better shit handed to them so let us not forget that, nor act as if we have the same struggles.	People make it difficult for me to discuss sexism in my culture because anything I say is used by racists to "prove" that my people are savage and backwards.	0
Women who have decided not to have children, what made you decide that?	Okay, so here's the thing: I want my children to exist, because I feel like I have good genes to pass on. I'd like to be an egg donor or something. That said, I don't actually want to have and raise kids. I don't really like kids, (some are pretty okay, though), and I get rather annoyed when I'm going on vacation or whatever, and have to figure out someone to take care of my cats. I just think I'd find it terrible having to plan around another human before I could even go out for a cup of coffee. I'm not saying I'll never have kids, because maybe one day I'll settle down, and feel like that would be an okay compromise. I am, however, saying that it hasn't happened yet, and I'm already in my 30s.	Realizing I didn't have to have kids is what caused me to decide I wasn't having any. Growing up it seemed like I had to have kids, which I had kind of admitted to myself, "Well this will be a miserable time in my life, but I'll get through it". When I realized having kids was optional, I decided I wasn't going to. How has it impacted my life? I feel much happier, not having pressure from something I don't want to do. How has it impacted my relationships? I only date people who also do not want children.	0
What's an unconventional occupation that you're secretly interested in trying?	Being a PI. I just want to be a moody alcoholic who follows people around all day. Or a crime scene photographer.	Male stripper. I want to slap women in the face with my cock that is covered in whipped cream and get them to blow me while I make tips. It's not even about the money. Or a CIA field agent/hitman/cleaner etc.	1
Women who have adopted a child who is older (6+), what was your experience?	I have not adopted myself, but I've heard a lot of families recommend reading the book "The Primal Wound". Apparently it's fantastic for helping adoptive parents understand the issues that an adopted child faces.	I personally have not adopted a child, but I was a child who was adopted at the age of 12. I don't know if you would like to hear about it from the other side or not?	0
What weird thing do you find sexy about yourself?	I was born with an underdeveloped nerve in the brain that limits some facial movement. I can't smile with my teeth showing, but because of the limited movement I'm a really good liar and can deliver sarcastic humor well. My doctor said I won't get typical face wrinkles from this. I love my "perpetual poker face." Edit: not sure if it's related but I can stick my whole fist in my mouth.	I have scars all over my body. People around me have always insisted me on getting it checked out since the scars are freaky as fuck but eh, the scars fit my lean body perfectly.	1
What do you think of this idea that there are "no truly straight women"?	It's wishful thinking. I've never had a single urge to do anything sexual with another woman. But people who claim there are "no truly straight women" will argue against that and say I don't know my own feelings or something like that, and it's hard to counter those kind of arguments because it will always come back to "but you don't know your own feelings, you're repressed" or something silly like that. Like a stranger would somehow know me better than I know myself.	The phrase and idea behind it is super gross. There are plenty of people who have zero attraction to members of their own sex. Sexuality might be a spectrum, but that still means there are people on either end (truly gay and truly straight). *That said,* I'm of the opinion FAR more people (both men and women) are slightly bisexual than what people believe. Generally, I think this is the case because people who prefer the opposite gender would say they're straight even if they occasionally had sexual attraction towards their own gender (which I would consider bisexuality or pansexuality). I feel like the phrase "no truly straight women" exists because women are more likely to admit to feelings of attraction towards their own sex (even if they say they're straight) whereas men have been socially conditioned to avoid that.	1
What is the worst birthday gift you've ever received?	One Christmas my mom got me an SAT study book. In her defense, I was going to be taking the SATs within the next year and I did end up getting accepted to my first choice university (besides Yale, which I mostly applied to because you never know).	My grandmother gave me a pair of used underwear for my 16th birthday. She'd had someone my size staying at her house and the girl had just left, so they got passed on to me wrapped in a nice little gift bag.	0
Does anyone else feel like they are constantly buying clothes but still feel like they don't have anything to wear? What am I doing wrong in my shopping?	Don't impulse-buy. Go shopping only when you need something and have a list of what you need, i.e. I want a maxi dress, ankle pants for work, and a couple work-appropriate short sleeve shirts. Buy pieces that work with multiple outfits. Take inventory of what you have at home before you go shopping. Accessorize! I used to be bad at this, but I'm getting better. A scarf, necklace, belt, etc. can change a whole outfit. Clean out your closet a couple times a year (I do this in the Spring and Fall). If you haven't worn it in the last year, get rid of it! Unless, of course, it's a special occasion dress or something. Finally, don't be afraid to experiment. Sometimes you never know what will look good together until you try it on! Mix and match what you already have!	Please consider buying your clothes second hand so that you won't contribute to the slave-labor-reliant fashion industry. Edit: To everyone downvoting me, I urge you to watch The True Cost and see how it changes your life.	1
Which character on Bob's Burgers do you identify with the most, and why?	As much as I have a sense of disdain for the show, I've had like six different people tell me that I reminded them of Gene. It's just the type of humor I have and the way I say things.	I wish I was Louise, or even Tina or Bob, but I'm becoming more of a Linda every day. I've started saying "Crackers, you're comin' with me!" when I grab my saltines for night snack.	0
What is some adivce you commonly see given on AW that you find not helpful or annoying?	People always suggest that you report someone to the authorities, even when there is no authority to report them to, you're not in grade school anymore. It's like tattling will solve all your problems.	Whenever someone tries to explain motivations of people they don't know in someone else's stories. It's one thing when someone's explicitly asking if anyone has any input on it, but it's quite another to have the inner thoughts of your high school best friend explained to you by some random on the internet.	0
What's with all the STEM worship on reddit?	Fragile masculinity parading as unquestionable emotionless unbiased logic. Edit: There's the angry man brigade, so emotional, it's just a joke y'all	Just my personal guess but...I'm thinking most redditors are "nerdy" and most nerdy types get science type degrees. Science fields feel that their degrees are more difficult to obtain and therefor worship them more than a liberal arts degree. There is a pecking order in college. I have a B.S. in civil engineering and among the other engineering schools such as electrical and mechanical, they thought our program was too easy and picked on us.	0
How do you feel about paid paternity leave and do you think it should be equal to paid maternity leave?	It should exist and yes it should be equal. Raising a child is always stressful, and new parents dealing with a newborn have to change their whole world around. They need their rest and they need time with their child - especially the fathers because they don't bond as naturally with the baby. I don't have a child yet, so I'm sure there are a lot more factors I'm missing, but from what I do know, I think the father needs the ability to be with his kid just as much as the mother. It's not just about physical recovery time.	I think there is a period of time that the mother needs off because of the physical demands of giving birth/breastfeeding. Besides that, either parent should have access to a period of parental leave, or they should be able to share it.	0
How do you feel about revealing your age publicly? To what extent is the year of one's birth a private matter?	I tell folks I am 15 years older than I really am but I moisturize. Then they tell me how great I look.	I'm 33 and I don't care who knows. The only thing is, I don't go around publishing my birthday online because I don't really want scammers to get a hold of it. But beyond that, I don't care if friends/family/acquaintances/whoever know my age. I don't even care personally how old I am, which is why when someone asks me, I usually have to stop and figure it out, lol. I think I stopped keeping track of birthdays around 25? Basically, once I was old enough to drink and have cheaper car insurance, I totally stopped caring about age.	1
In your current situation, would the advantages of being a man outweigh the benefits of being a woman?	I'm about to be travelling alone in foreign countries for about 2 1/2 weeks. All the travel warnings seem to think so.	In some ways. Men get promoted faster and treated with more respect by patients (which makes it easier to care for them). Also being stronger would be a plus. However I really like being a woman plus my relationship would definitely end and that would be sad.	1
Do any of you regret motherhood? Women 40-50+ with no children, how is your life?	I love my kids very much but raising children is a all encompassing venture. You will lose yourself, at least for a while, it will take a toll on your marriage on some level, it's a huge commitment. The only reason to plan for children is because you want children. There have been many days I wished that I had taken another path, but that's magical thinking. Do not have children unless you really, really want children. And don't feel guilty about not wanting children. It doesn't make you a bad, selfish, or lesser person.	SAHM mom in my late 20s. No regrets at all. I'm still active and have my own life. It can be done reddit, don't let anyone tell you it cannot. Having a helpful partner is the key.	1
What is the most disgusting meal a family member has ever served for you?	My mom made meatloaf once that I will never forget. It was white. Not sure why. Our dog wouldn't eat it. My mom also made an apple pie once that was a mile high and looked delicious. Only problem was the crust was so hard no one could cut it. My dad declared it a turtle and took us kids down the street to the river where we let it go. Good times! My mom's regular meal was Mac and cheese. It was elbow macaroni cooked in milk. Not sure where the cheese came into that concoction. I never knew Mac and cheese as anything good until my 20s.	My sister made baked macaroni one time and included breadcrumbs in the dish, which I thought was super weird but I'm not a doctor or anything so I didn't say anything. When she brought it to the table there was an inch-thick layer of breadcrumbs over the entire dish. Humans can't eat like that. It's an abomination. I gently scraped some of the breadcrumbs off my serving and my sister called me out for it, saying it was her mom's recipe and that it was good and then my dad told me I had to eat it. She's his favorite I think and he never wants to hurt her feelings. Family politics aside, they both watched me closely to make sure I ate all the dry foul crumbs and everybody else was able to hide or otherwise dispose of theirs because security was so focused on me.	1
What's your favorite part of Disney's "Mulan"?	Dude fuck Mulan. I had nightmares for months after seeing that movie. They make the Huns way too scary man.	The juxtaposition between the ending of "A girl worth fighting for" and seeing the razed village with the doll. Chills.	0
Hi, AW! What small changes did you make to your everyday routine that vastly improved the quality of your life?	Spend 10-15 minutes picking up your house after work, that way it doesn't build up until your day off. :)	I started getting up early enough to actually feel ready to leave the house. I was always like "yeah, I can be out the door in 15 minutes." Then I realized that while I could be out the door in 15 minutes, I wasn't actually getting ready before I left. I was still getting ready for the day at my desk, which was wrecking my drive in and eating time out of my day. I had an honest check to see how long it actually took me to really get ready with breakfast, dishes, etc. on my ideal morning, and I went from there. It was rough at first, but so much nicer to be functional at work - and people notice it.	0
What game(s) should I get from the steam summer sale?	Stardew Valley is one of my favorite games on steam, and it's on sale, Pillars of Eternity is an excellent RPG, but it's very old school, I just got Rise of the Tomb Raider, which I'm excited to start, and I've heard really good things about the new Doom. I'm probably not going to get that until Christmas, though because Overwatch is consuming my FPS life.	I got a vive, recently, and all I am playing these days is VR. So, if you have $800 to spend and a PC that can run it, I totally suggest getting a vive and then some sweet VR games ;)	1
If you had an emotionally abusive mom, when was your breaking point that you stopped taking it?	Can men answer this question? Mine was when she faked a heart attack to prevent me from finding a job and becoming independent. I put an ocean between me and my family and never looked back.	I drove five hours in a blizzard to see her and my dad and the first words out of her mouth were that I had love handles, and my boyfriend at the time must have been "into big women." I snapped.	0
Women who love their career choice, what is it and why do you love it?	I'm a marine biologist who studies whales and dolphins. Like any job, there are pros and cons but I really enjoy my work. It's difficult to find employment in my field of study because it's very competitive, so I consider myself very lucky.	I love my freedom and don't get trapped inside a boring rhythmic office. I feel proud being a lady in my line too :)	1
Women who said "no" when their SO asked them to get married: how did they take it and did you tell them why?	I'm not sure if this counts but he asked me during sex while he was drunk. I told him he couldn't do that and what was he thinking? He realized his error the next day and it was just an ongoing joke between the two of us. Eventually he proposed for real. We're married now... he still says inappropriate things at inappropriate times but I love him and he'll do.	He's asked on and off for years now, more often recently as he's getting older- we are well past the halfway stage of a relationship now. He asks, I say no, he asks why, I explain its pointless, repeat in six months.	1
If you could pick one girl/woman (alive or dead, real or fictional) to be your BFF, who would it be?	Leslie Knope from Parks and Recreation! She's smart, funny, and values friendship above all. That show will always put me in a good mood.	Hillary Clinton. She's had so much shit thrown at her over the years and she doesn't even break a sweat. I want to be like that.	1
Muslim women, do you wear a hijab or burqa (or any other head garment)? And how does it make you feel?	I wear a hijab, have for most of my life, and haven't felt any real animosity! Sure, there are second glances and too long stares from some but nothing too unbearable :) My biggest worry was if my patients would feel uncomfortable around me (just a med student) but but they've been great! My concern was whether they'd feel uncomfortable or ask to see someone else, but no one has seemed surprised/unsettled and we've gotten along fabulously, alhamdulillah :) I consider it an integral part of me so I pretty much take it into consideration when getting dressed. Fashion is a huge part of my life so I make sure it *complements* my outfit or vice-versa if I'm rocking a particularly cool hijab :) *Edit--wrong use of compliment. Hijabs can't talk :)	I do wear a hijab and I love it. The women in my family have always worn it to show our love for God and I am happy to continue the tradition. I only have one thing to say to people who insist a woman can't wear one without being forced or coerced: fuck off.	1
When have you run into an Ex and thought "I won." or "I dodged a bullet."?	She was dressed in the most sleaziest uncoordinated outfit I have ever seen. Fashion is the first thing I judge, so I felt better about myself after I saw her (her eyebrows were popping though).	My college bf had an issue with drinking too much and peeing the bed. "A phase!", I told myself. Recently (ten years later), I hung out with him and some old great friends at a wedding. He got wasted, passed out on the couch of my hotel room, got up in the middle of the night, peed in my luggage and denied the whole thing. At least he has graduated to the corner.	0
What are some negative traits you have but secretly like?	I'm extremely negative and introverted. I actually really like this about myself. I am able see what a lot of people refuse to see or acknowledge. I can see things for how they really are. I like I am a quiet observer and no one pesters me or expects anything of me.	I'm apparently a bit scary and standoffish which sucks when it comes to meeting new friends but is the best thing ever for teaching rowdy teenagers. I once silenced a dining hall full of kids by drawing myself up to my full height and looking at them.	0
Women who have taken self defense classes, how effective were they in real life situations (if you encountered one)?	It wasn't. Self defense classes deal with the stranger in the bushes type scenarios, which are exceedingly rare. It didn't deal with the subway car so crowded that you can't really move, or the friend who tries to take advantage of how drunk you are, etc.	I haven't needed to defend myself since taking the class, but the knife disarm was great for getting the TV remote away from someone because *no I am not watching "How It's Made: Tractor Edition" again goddamit.*	0
Did anyone have kids for the purpose of making their parents happy? If so, how do you feel about your decision?	I knew along time ago that I never wanted to have children. Now at 40, I know it was and still is the best decision for me. A few years ago I sat down with my Dad and explained my decision and what led me to make that choice and I told him he's an amazing father and grandfather. (He is a grandfather, he has 7 grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren from my siblings.) he just wouldn't be getting one from me. He kissed me on the forehead and said, "You do what's right for you. I am surrounded by plenty of love already and I don't want you doing something so life changing just for me." I have a good Dad.	I don't know if this totally fits but I just turned 31 and I'm 10 weeks pregnant. While I'm a professional my job doesn't pay very well and the father, a computer programmer, has been out of work for more time than I care to think about and already had 3 kids and issues with child support because of the laps in work. If it weren't for the support of my family who REALLY wants a grandchild and the support of my friends I'd be way more stressed out. It's not that I don't want kids but despite my age, on my own, I don't feel like I'm in a good place financially for this kid plus, on paper, the father doesn't sound very good, but my parents are more than ready to help me out so I'm gonna make it work.	1
Which fashion crimes do you proudly commit on a weekly basis?	Not sure if others consider it a crime but all winter I wear my Uggs and usually with fleece lined leggings as pants. I'm in the Midwest and winters are cold. Sue (suit?) Me.	my bra straps are very often visible. but hey, it's summer, i am physically uncomfortable if i don't wear a bra, and i'm gonna keep wearing tank tops because it's hot and my job doesn't include a professional dress code.	0
Those of you who found out you were the "other woman," did you contact the SO with proof of the cheating? What was the outcome?	I did. My now ex fiancé turned out to have never dumped his high school girlfriend. She didn't care. He'd done this for so long, she was immune to it. Eventually, I do believe she ended things for good, as the last time we spoke, she had cut things off after what he did to the both of us.	No. I didn't contact the SO and still would not. I have never known the women and didn't feel it was my place. I just ended it, told the dude what a scumbag he was, and moved on.	1
What accent have you got?	American, but Chinese American, it's very subtle. It's hard to describe but I notice it in other Chinese Americans in my area who are fluent in English but grew up speaking a Chinese language. (I can also "sound white" when I want/need to.)	not much of one to be honest. I was born in Massachusetts but moved to Ohio when I was 2. I moved BACK when I was about 12. The result is a lazy slipping in and out occasionally of the new england accent but largely nothing. when people ask where I'm from and I say Cape Cod they double take because I just don't sound like it. When I'm home visiting though, I slip into it like old sneakers almost immediately. :)	1
Ladies, what do you really think when a dude brings you to his place for the first time? What impresses you and what is a total turn off?	Biggest turn off: Filthy bathroom. Its not uncommon for me to go use the bathroom at a guy's place and find mold in the shower, streaks on the toilet, and pubes littering the floor. I always tell my guy friends, if you want women to stay over you HAVE to clean your bathroom. No one is going to want to spend the night here if they feel like they'll come out of your shower dirtier than when they went in.	Impressing: The bed sheets matching. Turn-off: Empty (or almost) beer cans. Cans are for the road, you use glass at home. Buy bottles. Don't buy cheap beer so you can drink a lot, buy good beer and enjoy it while it lasts. I don't mind you drinking it straight from the bottle, I hate doing the dishes too! But please, cans are for the road (Obligatory Don't Drink and Drive!) I'm 31 but thinking about it I haven't had any real relationship with someone who had their own place.. First one we both still lived with our (separate..) parents, 2nd he lived with his parents but we moved in together when I lost my own place, and the 3rd was living with his parents while the apartment he bought was being built with a massive delay, we broke up before it ever finished.	1
Have you ever lost a male best friend because of his SO? If so, what happened? Did you make it up after a while?	Not lost because that sounds weird to me, but I've definitely had male friends drift away once they got married or settled into a serious relationship. I think it's fine. It's expected that their wife/SO would be their priority instead of their friend (even if close friends). I don't take it personally. I would do the same to them.	Yes. He was annoying to begin with and he found an SO who was just as bad. Fuck that noise. Life is too short to hang out with people you don't like.	1
What's that small thing that people do that you really appreciate?	When we lived together, my SO would leave for work before me. I rode my bicycle to work. When I went downstairs, I'd find my bike turned around so I could walk it out the door instead of having to back it up because of the way I entered the day before. He would do all sorts of sweet things like that. We've been super long distance (Japan and US) since March after being inseparable for three years. Looking forward to reuniting in about three weeks!	Pretty much everything my SO does. He's extremely caring and always makes sure I'm taken care of. A few of the more recent ones are he went out of his way to buy me a heating pad, pain pills, and pads to leave at his place whenever I'm on my period. When I'm sick he also always makes sure I'm stocked up on cough drops, soup and medicine. I was also really sick one day and I pretty much slept all day/night. He made sure I stayed hydrated, woke me up to feed me and give me my meds on time and made sure I was warm. God I love that guy.	1
Married women of r/AskWomen: what was your favorite thing you put on your wedding registry?	The kitchenaid stand mixer, by far. It was priced at 499 or something horrendous, but my husband (then fiancé) is a cook, and he *drooled* over that thing, so screw it, we stuck it in there for shits and giggles. And damned if we didn't get one from his aunt who lives across the country. (The first time I ever met her was when she flew in for the wedding) We use that thing coooonstantly.	We received a gift card to Bed, Bath, & Beyond as a wedding gift. Husband told I me to get whatever I wanted. I chose a towel warmer. I'm petite and tend to be cold more often than not. A warm towel after showering when it's cold out (and sometimes even in summer) is heaven!	1
What changes have you intentionally made to your personality, and why?	I realized that my coworkers were ignoring me intentionally, and a long talk with my boss made me realize how stubborn and hard-headed I am. I started being more open to other people's opinions, being more complacent and complaining less, and now I feel much more like a part of the group.	My mother and I don't get along. In my teen years I started to notice how her and some people in general seem to gravitate towards drama and negativity. It just seemed like a lot of useless information to keep track of, who hates who because she/he said this.. I always thought how nice it'd be if the only thing I've had to worry about was whether or not I have enough TP or something. As a young adult I realized I simply didn't care about who hates who. I don't care what happened on tv. I just want peace. I chose peace. Mother eventually gave up trying to include me in family drama because I kept neutral about everything. This was also around the time I began studying Buddhism and that was more fulfilling than watching Rikki Lake.	1
Have you ever quit a job due to sexism, and if so what was going on to make you quit?	My boss was a friend of the family who smelled bad and hugged too long. He leered at the younger (female) employees a lot, and his wife was the manager so nothing was done about it. After I left, my friend's little sister started working there and he's been, like, groping her and shit. The company handles this shit extremely poorly on an administrative level, too, so there's not much hope for change.	Yes. I was required to act as the office secretary on top of being a programmer. So, I and another woman had the same job title as two men, we were all hired at the same time. The older woman programmer (the only other woman in the company) would make us answer the phones, take all the notes at any meetings, set up things like sending cards for sick coworkers, etc. The four of us all hired at the same time would hang out together over lunch, etc, and found out that the male new hires weren't required to do that stuff and actually weren't even aware that we were being told TO do it. I figured I could find better work elsewhere, so I did. Shortly thereafter, so did the other woman new hire, and one of the men.	0
Redditors love to bash women for having standards, but what are some ridiculous dating-requirements and double standards that men have for women?	With the guys I dated before my current SO, I noticed an expectation that I mingle and spend time with their friend group while they have no intentions of doing the same with mine. They might meet my friends once over drinks, but they would never want to hang out on the regular with my friends. Meanwhile, sometimes the only way I could see them was if I was going to hang with their own friend group.	TIL My Wife should be eternally fucking grateful for me. She was a virgin but I didn't care either way. She doesn't wax/shave with any sort of regularity, I don't care. She has long hair and the only time I gripe is during sex and it's all in my face because it's hard to keep a rhythm going or stay in the moment when suddenly Chewbacca. She used to shave and trim everything but got tired of it and each time more time would be between waxing and shavings and I'd just be like "I don't care. Pussy is pussy." She's got nice legs, hair and all.	1
Did you take your spouse's last name? Why or why not?	I did, yeah. My maiden name is that of a fish. My husband's last name is hispanic and pretty badass, tbh. I jumped at the chance to have a cool last name.	Dont want to be married, but if I ever did, I would not take his last name. Im not becoming his property. It's archaic as fuck. So much shit around marriage and weddings is archaic, and gross in my opinion. Man asking the womens father for permission. Father "giving away" the daughter, transferring her owndership to the husband to be, so she takes his last name as she belongs to him. Gross.	1
Women who went from 0 self-esteem to being very confident; how did you do it?	I had kids. Having to be solely responsible for another human being is empowering, and you realize how little the stuff that used to bring you down actually mattered.	Age. I was a very unconfident, shy and isolated 20 year old. 20+ years later, life is great. I'm happy in all areas of my life (except I can't grow tomatoes)	0
What is something a lot of men do, and you just don't get?	I haven't met many men who felt like running away for their life when they saw a cockroach and I just don't understand that. What else does one run away from?	Pee standing up. Sitting down is less messy. It doesn't unman you. If you're at home, just sit down. The person who cleans the toilet will thank you. (If that is you, you will thank yourself.)	1
WHo is a character in a movie or show who is supposed to be the romantic lead or super sexy but you just find repulsive?	I don't know why but I can't stand Meredith Grey from Greys Anatomy. Love the show, can't stand her. I feel like her face shows almost no real emotion. Or she's a bad actress. Am I the only one who thinks this?	No one from those twilight movies, Christain grey, Benny Cumberdrum, or whatever his name is, and that greasy guy who played Loki. I never liked Fabio, the Hemsworth brothers, and Ryan Gosling. I must be weird.	1
After how many dates did you become a couple ?	My boyfriend and I both accidentally tricked each other into becoming an official couple on our first date. While on the date, he innocently made a comment about how he couldn't believe I'd only had three boyfriends in my life. He himself was/is the third person I've dated, so I teasingly asked if he was counting himself as the third boyfriend already. He got adorably flustered and said "Only if you'll have me." I said "Of course," and we kissed and had ice cream : )	I think it was 2 dates. He wanted to unlock the girlfriend achievement pretty quickly and I thought he was joking! Now I know that when he wants something he tends to just go for it and I guess he saw Something in me he wanted to keep around a bit. :)	1
What's your most unusual hobby, and how did you get into it?	I'm a professional seamstress now so I guess all my related hobbies like embroidery are no longer really hobbies. I am quite good at finding moderately valuable art at thrift stores. My most valuable piece is a signed and numbered Erte print that I payed $15 for and is appraised at $1500. I have another that I payed $25 for that is worth $300 and a few I haven't had appraised. However, I spend so much on the framing and I never intend to sell them so their value is moot 😆	Cosplay is my weird hobby-making costumes of characters and wearing them to conventions. Whats weirder I guess is that I usually cosplay male characters haha. It's a fun hobby and a great creative outlet. It's also taught me lots of skills like sewing and how to use power tools.	1
What did you do for your 30th birthday?	I went to a hotel with five close friends. We got day drunk and ate a lot and listened to music and went swimming in the hot tub. We went out downtown drinking and dancing. It was a lot of fun!	I went to Alaska—my goal was to visit all 50 states by my 30th birthday & it was the last one. I spent some time in Denali & Seward and took a day-long cruise on the Kenai Fjords on my birthday. I went home a couple days later & my best friend flew in to visit for a long weekend.	0
Do you have designated "period panties"?	I mostly have black underwear, but I feel like all of my panties eventually become period panties. It's the natural lifecycle.	Nope. I don't see the point. I've never ruined a pair, any stains wash off. And I wouldn't care about stains anyway, I don't have any fancy or expensive pairs.	1
What's one thing you never expected people to find attractive about you (but they do)?	My fucking face lips. Everyone, male or female, comments on my lips. Am I wearing lipstick? Am I wearing gloss? No. I've never in my life worn those and my lips look plain to me, but everyone raves about them. It annoys me for some reason.	I have a *huge* crooked nose. An older German lady stopped me once and told me that I had the most beautiful profile and that my nose was a gift. I had to hold back my laughter but I did thank her. I always thought it was the weirdest thing. I don't think she was lying either because she was this tiny older lady with a thick accent and she seemed really sweet. I've always been made fun of for my nose so for even one person out there to say it was beautiful was so very weird to me.	0
What's the juiciest piece of gossip you know about someone in your social circle that you've been dying to get off your chest?	Okay...one of my fellow managers (F 38) is pregnant by a former coworker (M 19). That alone is no big deal, older women have gotten pregnant by younger guys before. The JUICY part is that everyone thinks it's the managers current boyfriend's (M 29) child, but we did the math together and she knows it's not his, he was in jail at the conception date. Manager and coworker are white. Current boyfriend is black. I'm anxiously awaiting the due date.	This gossip is about me Throwaway acount. I've been cheating on my BF with my best friend for the past 6 months or so.	1
What's the difference between a "shitty" or "trashy" romance novel versus a good one?	i think a lot of people like to just tack on "shitty" so they make sure everyone knows they don't *really* like X or Y. like when people talk about hate-watching something? it's part insecurity (afraid to enthusiastically like things deemed lesser by society), part internalized misogyny most of the time. people just love to shit on media targeting women, especially romance anything i don't call romance novels shitty, but i think the difference between a bad one and a good one can be as simple as tropes involved, publisher, and cover?	A good romance novel has a plot regardless of the sex. A trashy romance novel has sex regardless of the plot. (And usually the sex is boring or repetitive.)	0
What are you still salty about years later?	Being sick the day of the Math Counts competition. I was the fucking captain. My best friend was the only other dude on my level on our squad. Like together we would have fucking wrecked the competition.	My friend from middle school was staying at my house for the night. She snuck in her boyfriend and they had sex on my beloved baby blanket that my grandma made for me. I wanted to give it to my children but now it's tainted in my eyes. I know it sounds silly but it still irks me 12 years later.	0
Poor women of Reddit,what's the strangest thing you've been told you shouldn't have because of your financial status?	Nice clothes. Good makeup. My 3ds, tomodachi life, Pokemon x&y, animal crossing new leaf (a gift from my sister who knew I was lonely and depressed and jobless). I got told I couldn't have them because I was poor and jobless at the time. /waits for more down votes for answering the thread/	I watched a pretty great video about a Canadian Street nurse who works with homeless people. They talked about how a fair amount of homeless people had cellphones. People I know have been angry when someone has begged them for change, when they're holding a cellphone. You'd think that really wouldn't be a necessity when you don't have your basic needs met, but even homeless people have families, friends, and could need it for getting a job, etc. It's hard to see things from another person's perspective sometimes.	0
What is a common misconception about your career?	That it was some sort of linear progression rather than a series of chances I took and good (and bad) things that happened over time.	"You must be good at math!" I'm an accountant, Excel does all of my math for me and even then 90℅ of that math is just addition and subtraction. What I AM good at is understanding tedious procedures and filling out forms. And as I wind down my bartending career, I'd like to make it known that the majority of other bartenders I've worked with over the last decade were all in long term relationships if not married with kids. Flirting with us is fun but not going to achieve anything.	0
What is something you feel guilty about doing but continue to do it anyways?	Drinking coffee and other liquids as a substitute for a meal. Like, I don't deliberately set out to drink a coffee or a smoothie in lieu of a meal, but I have such a small appetite that a coffee would make me feel full for hours afterwards.	Tossing a fistful of Cheerios on the carpet by my feet, for my 1-year-old to eat. Hey sometimes, she's freaking out and throwing a fit, I'm trying to get something important done, and I know it will distract her for awhile as she hunts for them all...	0
Do you feel like you have ever been accurately represented in media, and if so, what show/movie got it right and how?	As a teenager I was really happy Daria existed. I was angsty and frumpy and so many teenage role models were pretty and fashionable and popular. Daria was a reminder that there isn't one mold in society.	The new Ghostbusters is the first time I truly understood what representation feels like. I got to see a summer blockbuster with 4 complete women who were awesome, smart, funny, unsure, overcame adversity, worked together, ate, weren't sexualized, and didn't involve a man. They felt authentic in a way my friends do. It was a truly wonderful moment that I wasn't entirely prepared for. I spent most of the second half of the movie silently weeping. It was like not realizing how bad the pain was until it stopped. I've been able to identify with plenty of characters before (and I've spent my whole life learning how to identify with men) but this was a first for me. I honestly didn't know I could feel like that.	1
What's a product for women you wish existed?	A device that just sucks your period out of your body. I would love to have it over in a minute	**ITT**: products that do exist; but people just didn't know that they existed, didn't look for them, or couldn't find them. There aught to be a subreddit dedicated to such products full of links to where they can be purchased. Maybe there already is. I wouldn't know. Didn't look.	1
Women who don't wear makeup-why don't you?	I think it's a bit ridiculous? It's face paint. I'll do the face-paint thing when I go out clubbing because I'm trying to get laid, I'll do the face-paint thing for pictures because easier than photoshop, but I'm not going to wear it on a daily basis. Plus I have bad skin - it's really strikingly obvious when you have bad skin covered up with make up. Also I still don't 100% believe people who say that 'they're wearing it for themselves'. You mean to say if you were the only human being left on Earth, the first think you'd do when you woke up in the morning is make sure your winged liner was on fleek? I just don't buy it.	I hate how it feels on my skin, I don't want to spend the money or time, and it's inconvenient. I have a good skin care regimen of course, and always put moisturizer/SPF on before I leave my apartment but otherwise, no make up.	0
What is the craziest conspiracy theory you ever heard that a friend/family member genuinely believed?	If you don't say the line "Jesus Christ is my personal Lord and Savior," this ostensibly all-loving creature will burn you in a fiery pit not just once, but ... brace yourself ... for *eternity.* And torture you and stuff. Like, forever. Legitimately.	My Grandmother was convinced that the Space Shuttles were causing the hole in the ozone layer. Like, they were physically tearing a hole in the ozone when they went to space.	0
Ladies who are currently in a relationship or married, what do you like the most about your SO?	I am myself around her in a way I simply am not with anyone else. She brings my walls down just by being near me--I am never as silly with anyone else or by myself as I am with her, she brings that out of me. It's only because of her that I've been able to honestly see myself (good and bad) and grow as a person. She's also an insanely generous person who has worked hard to also be confident/self-validating at the same time, and I am really proud of how much she invests in both of those qualities.	He is highly educated (terminal degree), in a very competitive stem field. He is the perfect candidate to be self-centered and arrogant. Yet... He cares about little things. He plugs my phone in when I forgot. He leaves medicine for me on the nightstand when he leaves for work before me and I was not feeling well the night before. He will gas up my car without telling me. He notices little things and he cares about those little things and it never ceases to humble me the time and attention and care he has for things other people might easily dismiss as inconsequential.	0
Tell me about the worst boss/manager you ever had. What made them horrible? How long were you there and how did you get out?	He would personally insult me on a weekly basis. "You graduated college?" "you sound like a housewife instead of an engineer." I tried various methods of agreeing with him, arguing with him until I gave up and would just walk away from him when he was being an ass. I lasted 1.5 years and said screw it because I caught my ex-husband cheating on me. So I left them both. Can't go to work to escape home, can't go home to escape work.	My first manager was a horrible person in general. She smoked and drank redbull and who knows what else every day at work while being 8 months pregnant. Now her son is mentally handicap.	1
What is a LPT/Lifehack that is something small that has made a big difference you that you would like to share?	I do 10 of some sort of exercise every time I stand up at home. Usually squats or burpees, without really even trying I can do a few hundred a day and I've definitely noticed a difference in my body.	If you're too sick to take care of yourself on your period please use a pad. I'd rather change your pad than tampon. Also please have pads, it feels really wrong for me to insert something in my wife's vag while she isn't awake.	1
Married ladies who took your spouse's surname...does it suit you? Was it weird at first, having a different name?	It was odd at first but I got used to it in a few months. I was a bit surprised how quickly I got used to it. Mrs. LastName took me the longest to get used to because that's my mother-in-law, not me. Oh, yeah, it's me too. One of my husband's older relatives always calls me The Lovely Mrs. LastName; I'll have to ask if my mother-in-law is also lovely ;)	I took my husband's name. It doesn't suit me and I don't like it, we're divorcing and I CANNOT WAIT to get my maiden name back. Lesson learned. I will never change it again.	1
What went through your mind when you saw a erect penis for the first time in person?	That it was a lot higher and front-er on the body than I thought it would be. The mechanics of sex started to make a lot more sense.	I'm not putting my mouth on that*. Hmm I may not even want that inside me and will just stick to getting oral. *And to this day I've been fortunate to never have.	1
What was the best piece of advice you have ever received? Who was it from?	I was married to an abusive man and I wanted to leave but was scared. I think I had battered wife syndrome or something. My aunt knew what was going on and asked me "If your daughter were in the same situation what would you tell her? That's what you need to do." It was about 2-3 weeks later, I packed what I could fit into my car and never saw him again. I've given the same advice to other women because it's what saved me and is probably the reason I'm still alive.	I was at work when I found out that a really good friend of mine was killed in a car accident in the early hours of that morning. I excused myself into a private room where a coworker saw me crying and asked what was wrong. After I told her she said "Don't let people see you crying, it shows you're weak".......	1
Are you the kind of person to get the same thing every time you go to a restaurant because you've had it before and know it's good, or do you get something different so you aren't missing out on something better?	If I'm trying a new restaurant I'll order a "canary in the coal mine" type dish to see if the restaurant itself is any good - lasagna at an Italian restaurant, General Tso's at a Chinese restaurant, a burger at an American restaurant, that kind of thing. If it's good and I go back, I'll branch out.	I have very limited tastes, so I tend to get the same few dishes at restaurants. Chicken fingers, spaghetti, Alfredo, quesadillas, etc. I'm not a very adventurous eater since in so picky. That being said, I can always find at least one thing on a menu that I can eat, so if I get taken somewhere that I don't like, such as perhaps a sushi restaurant, I'm sure they would have a dish of rice or something.	1
Those who still live with parents/relatives or with roommates: what are some things you have decided you'll do differently when you're on your own with your own space?	Oh god, both of what you already said. Also, not hanging onto food and condiments that we never use/that went off in 2010/etc. Basically downsizing everything, my family are hoarders. I'll also keep the bathroom really clean, without products freakin' everywhere. We also need a TV stand/case thing. At the moment it's perched on top of a big trunk and wires are EVERYWHERE.	DECORATING. Everything will be cuter and spookier at my future all-to-myself home. And organizing. While it saves money, I have the family who saves all the old containers (butter, plastic ice cream ones with lids, etc.) which only confuses me AND makes the fridge space usability inefficient. I'm particular to Sistema and snapware containers. My house will have many of these. edit: also, NO DEEP CHEST FREEZER THINGS. idk what possessed my parents that this was a good idea. I'm 23 and digging through that mess to find my frozen veg baggie pains me. :(	1
Previous owners of lusciously long hair: what has been the reaction to your *very* short haircuts?	When I was dating my ex, I had a short bob. He saw some old pictures of me with waist-long hair and hinted that he'd like me to grow it out... and I hinted that he could go fuck himself. A few days later his mom said "I was surprised when we met, because my son usually prefers girls with long hair". I replied "well, he can go date one of them, then" and that was the end of it.	I went from long, luxurious curls to a 1/4" buzz cut. Women were generally surprised, but liked it. Men were overwhelmingly *angry*. "Are you a lesbian now?" "*Someone's* got issues." "Your boyfriend let you do that?" "What, are you some kind of angry feminist or something?" One asshole grabbed my arm and checked for track marks. My SO is the one who made sure my shaves were even all over, and I kept the same job I've had forever, so no impact there aside from the drug test.	0
What "beauty hack" do you think is malarkey??	Coconut oil is comedogenic, meaning it can clog your pores. I am not going to use that shit on my acne-prone skin! If it works for you, great, but I hate seeing it touted as a product *everyone* should use as a moisturizer.	"use conditioner instead of shaving cream" - But, that would take so much more conditioner since it doesn't foam up - i would use the bottle up fast! Most of the time I just don't use shave cream at all and it actually makes me cut my legs less.	1
Women who are married/with a SO who's culture and lifestyle are completely different than yours, what were your thoughts and how did you deal with it?	SO is Korean, I'm British. There is definitely some culture clash, he spent most of his life there and is very proud of being Korean. He'll sometimes say something sexist, or slightly racist, and I would call him out on it. It caused a lot tension at the start of the relationship: we would erupt into arguments constantly. It's much better now though, after almost 3 years, either he's changed, or he doesn't bring it up anymore. On the positive side, he introduced me to Korean food! We have cupboards full of Korean ingredients now, I make it for myself even when he's not around.	I'm American and my husband is Mexican. I was really open to his culture from the beginning. I've learned to cook a lot of mexican dishes and have been learning Spanish. It's been a lot of fun getting involved in his holidays, music, dancing, and pop culture. There are some things we don't quite see eye to eye on, but we've always been respectful of each other's differences in opinions.	1
Can you explain the difference between "dating", "casual dating", "fwb relationship", "seeing someone" in American culture?	I think you'll find that many Americans can't agree on what those terms mean, which is why it's important for (non)couples to be clear about where they stand. "Dating" to one person might be the same as "casual dating" or even "fwb" to another person.	Oh man. Welcome to dating in America, which basically means everyone just fucks everyone without regards to people's feelings so in a nutshell that's pretty much it. The silver linings between the scenarios you describes are so thin that people just cross them all the time. Dating has definitely changed quite a lot	1
Thrifty brides of AskWomen, what are you glad you scrimped and splurged on, and what would you do differently if you had your time again?	We splurged on photography, food and drinks. Totally, totally worth it. If anything I would have had a bit less food. We saved on flowers- my mom and I grew them ourselves, and paid a friend of the family to help us make bouquets and centrepieces for the day. That was actually one of the funnest parts of prepping the wedding to me. And we saved a lot of cash on it, which was how we were able to pay for the photography.	Honestly? If I could go back in time and do it all again, I'd elope. I truly would. All that money we spent, and today, 20 years later, it literally makes me sick to my stomach to think of. I love my husband and the life we have, but it has absolutely nothing to do with a wedding. My advice is to save your money and just have a meaningful little ceremony with just you and him and your two best friends. Then let your families throw you a party if they want to. Years down the road you will thank yourselves.	1
Have you ever received advice about romance or sex that made you a little sad for the person giving it? What was the advice and what did you find sad about it?	From a very, very religious friend in high school: "You don't have sex for *pleasure!*" It just made me feel super sad because she made it clear that she expected her lot in life to be getting married, staying home, and having as many kids as possible. And that's cool if that's your jam, son! The thing that made me sad was that she viewed it as her Sacred and Irrefutable Biological Duty to lie there and think of England so she could have oodles of kids because "there aren't enough [insert her religious group]s in the world!"	A lot of comments on AskMen make me...sad. Not that they're sexist and it's not against the commenters individually but so many men seem to see relationships as somewhat...transactional? Obligations to be met, rules to follow. It makes me sad because of a society that makes them think it had to be like that - is the opposite of how I view relationships, which is based on trust, love and partnership. There's nothing specific or glaring but they talk about women as if it's a 1+1=2 kind of thing, it's completely different to how I see women talk about men on here. Does anyone else know what I mean (and can maybe explain it better than me haha)?	1
What was that one lie you gave your parents and surprisingly got way with while growing up?	A lot of things relating to my boyfriend when we are home for the summer. We have been together for a long time and my mom really likes him so she knows that "stuff" is happening but doesn't want to hear about it. My mom only asked for "plausible deniability" when it came to what we were doing; she wasn't opposed but she also just didn't want to know when and where we were doing it. We "watch" a lot of movies and she goes on a lot of veerrrrry long, loudly announced evening walks.	When I was like eleven or so creme de minte/sp was a taste I loved. So I would take a taste out of my parents seldom used liquor cabinet once in a while. Then at some point it was almost empty. What's a kid to do? Fill it up again with water. Never told them and they never asked. It was a very very pale green. I was in my late twenties at dinner with them when they asked if I would like an after dinner drink. Out comes the same bottle 3/4s gone. I honestly lost it laughing. Had to come clean and ask them if their dinner invitations were ever reciprocated. Lesson learned teetotaler parents are easily fooled.	0
(Serious) Is anyone else deathly afraid of giving birth and why?	Do I need a reason for being terrified of germinating a body-wrecking* parasite for nine months and then having it completely destroy what's left of my reproductive organs on its way out? *By "body-wrecking", I'm not just talking about pregnant boobs and stretch marks. Rotating your heart 45 degrees? Compressed lungs? Compressed bladder? Swollen feet, swollen ankles, hemorrhoids, gingivitis, the potential loss of teeth, blood pressure complications, morning sickness that may or may not go away, heartburn that no antacid will touch, cravings for all the things, the potential for detached abdominal muscles, potentially destroyed pelvic floor (which can mean incontinence if you're lucky), unpredictable mood swings..... And at the end of it, you're responsible for another human for the rest of your life. Hahahahah no.	Yes, because it can kill you or leave you with horrific injuries (fourth degree tears, fistula, pelvic prolapse). I deal with this fear by making sure it never happens to me.	0
What do you do for a living? And if you had to do something else, what would it be?	I'm a stripper and personally enjoy it. But I'm not a one trick pony, I have plans to move to the big apple and become powerful executive's secretary after I graduate collage	I am a medical biller. If I could be anything, I would be... A meteorologist... Or a marine biologist... Or an archaeologist... Or a billionaire.	0
What's a common piece of advice on Reddit that you think hurts people more than it helps?	I really hate the armchair diagnostics. Personality disorders in particular get thrown around like confetti under the criteria of "this person seems sucky from your description." This works towards increasing the stigma of these, which in turn makes seeking and getting treatment harder. It makes people associate disorders with only assholes and writes them all off as if no one does seek treatment for them. Unless you are medically caring for someone, stop diagnosing. If the OP has things that indicate an issue that might need treatment, guide them to seek that. If someone is describing someone and that person seems awful, use that or some synonyms, not a medical diagnoses. A medical diagnoses is not a damn adjective.	Lose weight. You'll be happier. Edit: I've just noticed that Reddit seems to be exceedingly fat phobic. Instead of highlighting healthy lifestyles, people on here attack anyone who doesn't fit their idea of attractive.	1
I'm having a hard time finding a job. What did you do when you had a hard time finding a job?	Oof. Yeah, I've been there. My last job I got after sending out 155 applications. My current job I got after sending out 63. Nothing pissed me off more than people with jobs telling me to hang in there because I'd find something, but now that I'm on the other side, there's nothing else *to* say. Job hunting sucks balls, there's no getting around it. But no one, except for dead people, is jobless forever.	From my experience, being picky lowers your chance of getting a job. It's not about preference. So long as you can pay your bills with the job, you gucci	1
How big is your social circle?	It's not something I consciously quantify. Best I could do is break it down broadly into categories. **Besties:** Maybe 5? **People I would want to hang out with 1-on-1:** Perhaps another 10 or so people. **People I see regularly in non 1-on-1 situations:** ~30? **People I interact with regularly on social media:** ~another 10 **People I don't necessary interact with regularly but still consider a friend:** ~30? (includes school friends, for instance) My preference would be for more 1:1 friends, but I've expanded my wider social group in the last few years which I'm quite happy about.	All but one of my friends are coworkers. I'm not sure why you are disallowing coworkers and roommates from being friends of people that want to answer. IME, coworkers have ended up being my closest friends.	0
What's a dating advice that sounds good on paper but falls flat IRL?	"try actually approaching men first instead of waiting for them to approach you" i mean if they're not approaching you they probably dont want you, but ok.	Any time someone says that looks don't matter, I roll my eyes. While I don't think they should be the *only* thing that matters, physical attraction is pretty important.	0
Why is it so common for women to say that they don't get along with "other women"?	I wouldn't say that I don't get along with other women, but I have more guy friends than girl friends. I think it's because I see other women being so wonderful and feminine and having great fun with other girls and I feel a bit intimidated. I'm a bit awkward and shy and afraid to approach them in case they talk about how much of a loser I am (even though I know they won't really). I'd love to be one of the girls, I just don't consider myself cool enough yet.	Sexism, mostly. It's about being the cool girl, who gets along with the boys, because girls are soooooo much drama and bla bla bla.	1
If you didn't have to worry about startup funds, what type of business would you start?	I would open up a exclusively LGBTQ+ daytime café! We have a lot of night clubs/bars, but I don't think I've ever heard of daytime no age limit café's.	One of two things: 1. A restaurant! Just because I like to cook. I think I would mainly focus on carby, greasy, comfort foods like mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. There would be potatoes in like every form imaginable on the menu. There would be cheese in every form imaginable on the menu. There would be cheesy mashed potatoes. 2. A clothing store that lists the sizes of the clothes in REAL MEASUREMENTS. Centimeters. And the pants will have three numbers, not just one. Diameter of the opening at the waist, diameter of the widest part at the hips, and inseam length. In centimeters. **AND EVERYTHING WILL HAVE POCKETS.**	0
Women who got married to someone who they only knew for a year or less, how did your marriage turn out?	So my now husband and I met and decided to make a kid about 3 months in the relationship. We got married when our son was maybe 4 months old. We were planning a wedding but eloped because we didn't want to wait, we just wanted to be a family on paper. It's only been a year but I would do it all again.	When I was nineteen I married a man I'd known for nine months. We divorced six years later after he came out to me on my birthday.	0
Moms of AskWomen: what is something about having kids that nobody tells you?	How much I *wouldn't* miss my previous life. I had a great career, where I was superstar, before I had kids. I don't think twice about it. The career, the friends, the going out, all of it...I recognize it as a season in the cycle of life. My new life is infinitely better.	The "4th trimester"- basically that a newborn is still more like a child in utero for the first 3 months, where they'll just want to be constantly attached to you and to eat. Also, that you're not a bad parent for hating the baby phase. I know some parents are all about it, but I love having a tantruming, willful toddler way more than the baby stage.	0
What made you realize your SO/ex-SO was raised by wolves?	Once I brought my ex some Thai food and he just opened the box, sniffed and seemed really hesitant to eat. That's just fucking offensive.	Every time he peed, my ex would get pee droplets all over the seat and the floor. We didn't live together, so he would do this in my apartment. I would go to the bathroom and see pee everywhere, and when I would go to him like "WTF bro, you pee everywhere," he'd ask me "Well what do you want me to do about it?" -_____- He wasn't raised by wolves, but he was raised by an absolutely insane helicopter mom who no doubt would have no qualms about trailing after her 24 year old son wiping up his pee on the bathroom floor.	0
What was the worst time when "only for boys/men" was used against you?	I asked my dad once to teach me how to change a tire just in case I get stuck in the middle of nowhere and need to do it, he told me "that's not something taught, is something boys just know/are showed, girls don't do that" and then questioned me later as to why I didn't change my tire when I had to walk a ways to get help for a flat tire while stuck one time	My sister and i as kids (both in early 20's now) weren't allowed to play game boys and video games bc they were "for boys." So now I nothing about gaming... And my bf is an avid gamer 🙄	1
Those who make a living in a creative field (art, music, writing etc.) what do you create and what does your work day look like?	I am a full-time Car Designer in Detroit! I am the only female designer on my team, so it's a very interesting work environment, but I basically get paid to draw cars all day! Most days consist of research, sketching on paper, digital painting of my designs, and working with clay and digital sculptors to turn my 2D drawings into 3D vehicle concepts. It's an amazing place to be, extremely competitive, but who can complain about getting to be creative all day surrounded by other insanely talented,passionate, creative people?!	I make my own porn for my website! Does that count? I get to direct and edit and write everything. It's a lot of fun. I got annoyed with never seeing porn I wanted to watch, so I try to make things towards a woman-centered audience.	1
How often do you get "girlfriend-zoned", and what is it like?	The term friend-zone and girlfriend-zone is pathetic. People just need to grow up and realize not every girl wants to date you and not every guy wants to date you.	I've had it happen once, it made me feel like crap. I think I'm an awesome friend, and I never lead anyone on. Why was my friendship not enough? I value my friends, I value those close friendships, I expect others to do the same. Then he started moping about how I wasn't interested in him, which made me feel like a bad person. I was in the position of constantly having to shoot down his advances because he was repeatedly ignoring me saying I wasn't interested, then I was the bad person for hurting him. In the end, I decided he wasn't someone worth being friends with.	0
What's something you own that you would never have bought for yourself, but are SO grateful that someone gifted it to you?	A kindle. I always read a lot and was super anti-kindle because I loved books. My mom bought me a Kindle for Christmas a few years ago and I absolutely love it. I can get any book I want within minutes, and most books for free from the library while I'm just sitting at home. Also, I can bring a billion books with me wherever I go and it takes up almost no space. I also have arthritis in my hands so holding a book open gets painful for me after a few minutes but the kindle is really easy to hold!	Oh gosh, SO much... A lot of my stuffed animals from my fiancé, a smart TV, we went splitsies on a record player, a resume portfolio, and my wireless headphones. The headphones are the best thing ever, holy shit.	1
I feel like no one talks about the changes your body REALLY goes through when you get older(even from your teens to your twenties). What has changed for you that you wish you could have told your younger self?	I wish I could tell my younger self to never use liquid foundation (which I did every day for about 15 years). My pores are horrible now that I'm in my 30s.	I thought that when you reached your 20s, your skin cleared up and acne became a thing of the past. That didn't happen. It just changed locations. It went from being a problem on my forehead to being a problem on my cheeks. I finally gave up and went to see a dermatologist who told me that that shift down is very common due to the hormonal changes your body goes through from teens to 20s. I wish I had discovered retinoids and double cleansing sooner. My skin didn't get naturally better in my 20s; I got better at managing it.	0
My SO and I are moving houses for the first time. Do you have any tips or tricks to make the moving process easier?	Purge while you pack. If there are things you never use or have been meaning to get rid of, do it now. Don't pack and haul a bunch of junk and clutter around with you. It'll make unpacking go more quickly.	If you can afford it, just hire movers. It saved my partner and I time and energy that would would have spent arguing with each other because we were hot/hungry/tired.	1
What was the most memorable thing your current or former SO said or did that "sealed the deal" to sweep you off your feet?	"I want to be super gay for you" Aside from being a funny thing to say, the sentiment was that he wants to do whatever girl things I want to do if it'll make me happy. It sounds weird but it was really sweet at the time	He went stomping around the prairies in -40 weather to cut me down a Christmas tree, and brought it back for me in the back of his tiny little car.	0
What's the biggest age gap in which you could consider to be in a relationship with someone? 10? 20? Maybe less or more?	I think my answer will change with age (hence the half your age + 7 rule). I could go down to 18 at the youngest, provided they were out of high school though, and don't think I would consider someone over 25. A 30-year-old seeking out a relationship with a 20yo college kid (me) would skeeve me out *bad*.	As a guys i always calculate: My age/2 + 7. 20 year old: 20/2 + 7=17 minimum Age to Date; 25 year old: 25/2 + 7=19.5 (you can deice if you want to round up or down) ;) 30 year old: 30/2 + 7=22; and so on. seems to work :D	1
What has been your most horrendous cooking disaster?	When I was in college, I went to Wawa for a chicken sandwich. By the time I got back, it was cold, so I decided to just pop it in the microwave. Unfortunately, I did not realize that the wrapper was made of a thin layer of foil between two pieces of paper. After a few seconds, my roommate started yelling, "FIRE!" I unplugged the microwave, ripped open the door, threw the only liquid I had in my dorm room on the sandwich - Crystal Light pink lemonade - and then slammed it shut so as not to set off the smoke detectors. My roommate and I then carried the microwave outside so that we could let out the smoke. Surprisingly, the sandwich was only burned on one tiny corner and the wrapper had protected it from the pink lemonade. It was delicious.	I was waiting and waiting for my pasta water to boil. Finally noticed I hadn't turned on the stove. So I turned it on. After waiting for an usually long time AGAIN, I lifted the lid to see what the problem could possibly be now. No water in the pot. That pot is fun colors of the rainbow now.	0
What is a tradition you and your SO have?	He goes to work much earlier than I do in the morning. He gets up early, showers & eats breakfast, then comes back to bed for cuddles until my alarm goes off. Then he gets dressed and waits for me to come downstairs to kiss him goodbye when he leaves. It's a routine I miss deeply when he's deployed.	To never talk to each other again as long as we both shall live. OK, she's ex, but still significant.	1
What TV show (past or present) do you think is extremely underappreciated? What makes it so good in your opinion?	The Mindy Project. I know people mostly know about it, but it is perennially underrated. It is the only show that can make me laugh out loud. Every character- Mindy, Jeremy, Morgan, Peter, Jodi- is hilarious. If you haven't watched it yet, I *highly* recommend you start. Edit: My guilty pleasure is Young & Hungry. I'm embarrassed to admit that I watch it, but it's just such a feel-good show!	A lot of people on the internet like Pushing Daisies, but nobody who I talk to in reality has heard of it, even fans of Hannibal (same creator). It's a show about a piemaker who can raise the dead by touching them and kill them again with another touch. If he lets them live, someone else dies. He uses this power to solve crimes. For such a morbid premise, it's a really upbeat show. And visually stunning.	0
what's extremely trendy where you live right now?	LaLaRue leggings in hideous patterns on extra - large women. This company is doing no one any favors, and it seriously bothers me.	Crazy loaded milkshakes. Like, a milkshake topped with a donut, a rasher of maple bacon, whipped cream and froot loops, that kind of thing. They look artistically pleasing but impossible to eat (/drink) and the thought of the energy content is enough to make them unappealing!	0
What TV show or movie do you view differently from when you watched it as a kid or teenager? How have your opinions changed?	ICarly. I used to sometimes see this with my nephew when they visited years ago. Didn't realise it at the time but Sam (girl) used to constantly seriously assault the boy character Freddie, like at least once per episode. And this was proper assault not just slaps (which aren't excusable either) and it was all done for laughs with him never being permitted to defend himself. In fact she assaulted other male characters like Gibby and some adults too but only once did she attack a female	The Phantom of the Opera. I fell in love with the musical when I was a child and grew up loving the angsty, misunderstood Phantom. Why on earth would Christine fall for that bland goody-two-shoes Raul? Erik is totally the one who's more in love with her, and he can sweep her off her feet with his music and tragic backstory. At the age of 33, I realized that Phantom of the Opera is my Twilight. FML.	0
What is something your SO does that makes you feel loved?	He leaves his clothes all over the apartment and when I tell him to pick them up he smiles and asks me 'what else are women for?'... Ah true love	He'll randomly stop in the middle of what he's doing and come snuggle me for a few minutes, then resume what he was doing. There's also a few little things, like picking something small up from the store that he knows/thinks I might like.	0
What deal breaker(s) did you discover AFTER moving in with your SO?	I think I'd rather just live alone and pee in the sink than live with someone at this point. And play video games ALL day. Can't wait for sex robots.	With my ex from college, I realized that I would pretty much have to do all the cooking and cleaning constantly because he could never be bothered with it. Moaning and tantrums happened when I asked him to do something. And he wondered why I became cranky all the time.	0
How do you feel towards pink tools marketed towards women?	I would LOVE for tools to come in more colors. If I could get my tool box in a rainbow, I totally would. But just pink? That feels like pandering. And I bet a lot of dudes would think it was pretty cool to be able to pick what colors their handles are too. You could even do something like all your metric ratchets are blue and all your imperial are green. Practical!	The only way I'd see this to be a good idea is if the money goes to a cancer foundation. Aside from that, I find it completely degrading to women (I'm a man chiming in). There are a ton of women who work trades and construction, why should they have tools that define women? There's just something so fantastic about a woman wielding a DeWalt power tool, it's just so exciting to watch.	1
How did you get over your "I'm not like other girls" phase?	I don't know really. I grew up, got more life experience, got to know more girls, had more diverse friendgroups, etc.	What does that even mean? I'm not like the socially hyped image of the girly-girl who loves to shop and fusses with her makeup and nails, and only thinks about guys and gossip. Does that make me not like other girls? Most of my friends are not like that either. What does your question actually mean?	1
If you're a woman making $100,000+/year, what's life like?	Happy, but I'm a generally happy person who gets what she wants (by working hard and being tough, not by being annoying). I'm not sure if you're thinking the $100k makes a person a certain way...I think I am a certain way and that's why I make more than $100k. Do what you love and don't worry about the money. You could not pay me $1 million to do something I hate for 40+ years of life. EDIT: wow, leave it to Reddit to turn totally inspiring intentions into me being an asshole because I'm not thinking of all the poor people who are struggling and would do anything for money. Oh well, that's your choice.	I love it, but I'm still not used to it. I had my daughter when I was 17 and never ever expected to NOT struggle financially. I grew up on food stamps and donations from the church, so not stressing about how to afford groceries is a huge shift. I don't know if I'll ever get used to it.	0
What fanbase prevents you from being a fan of something you would otherwise enjoy?	I really enjoy both Harry Potter and Doctor Who, but I actively avoid interactions with fan-based stuff because people take it way too far. Can't I just like something for what it is without dissecting how it's connected to other things in some obscure way?	Nothing? I could care fuck all for the fans of movies or books or games, regardless if they're annoying or not. I like what I like and I don't really care about the people who like or dislike the same things.	1
ladies who have lost a significant amount of weight,how did you do it?	I follow Weight Watchers. It's essentially calories in vs. calories out, but I have an easier time wrapping my head around 30 points/day as opposed to 1300 calories/day for some reason. Because the plan isn't prepackaged meals or anything like that, it's really helped me completely change my eating habits.	Drug-induced anorexia. I mean, I know that's not the answer OP was looking for but I get asked this question all the time and I have stopped being coy and evasive and honestly, I went off the medication that was making me fat and onto one that barely allowed me to eat at all.	1
What is the dumbest thing you used to think about male/female anatomy or sex?	I didn't realize penetration was a thing. I thought the dude just pointed his penis and squirted the sperm into the woman from a few feet away. The mental imagery of this act is really, really hilarious though.	Not about human sex but I thought cats and dogs were the same species but different sex. I thought all cats were female and all dogs were male.	1
Bisexual ladies who have had relationships with both women and men, what are the things that you can do with your boyfriend but not girlfriend; or with your girlfriend but not boyfriend?	I'm more aware or paranoid out with a woman vs a man. Even when I'm just out with a straight friend I'm still alert to whether people are looking because I dress pretty androgynous or soft butch. Like the time my bff and I were out eating and got a stare down from this old couple. I assume they were staring us down because they thought we were together, I don't really know for sure but this was in a town that never felt very hospitable to queer women.	Weirdly... I've found that men seem to be wayyyyyy more insecure and jealous. With women, I can fuck them and then like right after talk about someone else I'm also dating or just anything. Men.... You like accidentally run into someone you dated and they are peacocking the rest of the day. And god the hand holding in bed with men. It's incredibly uncomfortable how immature and unaware men are. Gender role wise god it's a fucking relief dating a woman. Even just personally never having to perform femininity even In Public because people will just be like oh she's the dyke which whatever I'll take it.	1
What do you consider romantic that others might find offensive or creepy?	I feel like I kind of have a D/s thing going on with my husband even though we never explicitly discussed doing it. I'm usually a very headstrong leader type so it is kind of a nice change of pace. Since I don't currently own money, I ask him if I can buy things sometimes (usually frivilous things, I don't ask with important stuff) and for some reason get a lot of contentment out of this dynamic and being given permission. It almost feels like a father-daughter dynamic and I bet a lot of people find that creepy. I also like it when he randomly comes up and starts grabbing my butt or boobs or something. From what I understand a lot of people find that offputting.	My boyfriend is very fond of the slap to the face as a sign of affection. I am super into it. My husband really enjoys being called "onii-chan" which means big brother. Better if I say it in a cute little kid voice. Actually I think like a good 75% of my romantic and sexual relationships with those two would make vanilla folks really uncomfortable. Huh, I am honestly not sure which part of this caused the downvotes. But I cant say Im shocked.	1
What are your bad online dating stories?	Finally met her after talking for forever. Made out on the first date. Smashed on the second and third. Really got down on the fourth. Called things off by the fourth month because she seemed to only be interested in non-monogamy. Yea, that's about all i got. Really fucking fell for this woman. Have a real hard time getting over it.	One time a guy told me the next day that he has a wife and two kids but they're only together for the kids and both date separate people. Yeah okay. Also, he gave me a didgeridoo that he carved, on our first and only date.	0
1.) Who was your high school crush?	LOL, high school JoyfulStingray did not have only ONE crush. She crushed hard, became disinterested when they didn't show interest, then crushed hard on the next boy who talked to her.	Haha, my high school crush was this dude who was super super into professional wrestling and swearing a lot. I'm embarrassed to think of it.	1
What are your favorite things about other women?	They are always willing to give you a tampon/pad when you in need. I find men and women have more in common that people give them credit for but that is one thing they can't understand nor are they ever prepared for.	Considering I more or less worship women (mental Illness yay) this thread is like an odd bible to me. At the same time, I don't really have anything to contribute, because as someone who regrettably can't claim the title of "women" I don't really know if a trait or behaviour is something that I have evidence for or if I've just made up.	1
What female character in a TV show can you not stand no matter how much the show tries to make her likable or how much other people defend her characterization?	Robin from How I Met Your Mother. She was okay at first, but as time went on, I just couldn't stand her.	Kelly from the Office. She's never thankful for anything and doesn't learn from her mistakes. She's just selfish without any moments of self-awareness, and that ended up making her the one character I could never laugh at.	1
Women who are very financially successful, how did you get there and what advice do you have for others?	Not there yet, but I'm doing much better after I started *really* considering that everything costs money. I mean like not buying those $20 shoes that seem *so* cheap but I can do without, the small stuff really adds up quick. Something else I noticed: I spend less when I go to the supermarket less often and buy a lot of stuff that lasts over a week. If I have to keep going to the store, I'm *certainly* going to spend money on stuff I don't need.	Haha! Sorry your post didn't work out, I was excited to see the answers! Maybe this is all society brain washing us in to thinking having a house and budgeting your groceries on 50k a year in a fly-over-state is what it means to be rich. Glad those women are happy with their lives but I wanted to hear from people that don't GAF what they spend on groceries!	1
What weirdly specific thing makes you sad or emotional?	Scenes in movies where an animal loves and trusts a person, but is in danger so the person has to shoo them away or set them free and the animal is like "but we're friends" and can't understand why the person doesn't like them anymore. This situation may have happened in Dances with Wolves or maybe I just constructed that in my mind. Also it happened in Air Bud.	Children laughing makes me cry because it sounds so delightful, pure and beautiful. Later on in life, they might not find joy in the smallest things or they will be too stressed out or whatever.	1
Women of Reddit: what is your libido REALLY like?	Either 0 or 100 depending on various factors that I haven't figured out yet. Either I have no interest, or I'm actively trying to undress my partner at every opportunity. I think part of it is hormonal but the rest of it is a mystery.	I find it weird how many people here are saying that their libido goes away when they're single. I've been single my whole life. Holy shit, I'd give anything to not be constantly horny almost every day.	1
Vegans of AW: What made you decide to go vegan?	The trifecta: 1) Animal cruelty 2) The environment (animal agriculture is horrible for the environment) 3) My health The catalyst - one of the various documentaries on animal agriculture. I went pescatarian for a month, vegetarian for 3 months then full vegan. The step down method is how I prevented failure from lack of cooking ideas. It's hard to wipe your recipe repitour clean and start over; it can easily lead to frustration, overwhelm and giving up. Noticeable changes: I feel AMAZING! I've been lactose intolerant my entire life and had been conveniently ignoring it because cheese is delicious. I also don't feel really tired after meals, and my fitness gains have been incredible. I weight lifted and did other various forms of exercise before and after going vegan. My muscle/lifting gains happen so much faster and I finally have cardio stamina which eluded me for the longest time.	I was already vegetarian for about five years, and hadn't really eaten much meat in about ten years before that. A vegan friend recommended I watch Earthlings to understand why he was vegan and I just gave up eggs and dairy there and then. I've always been kind of a picky eater so I've ended up eating much better since I turned vegan (I basically lived off dairy products before). I'm more willing to try new foods (so long as they're vegan), and I cook for myself much more often. I would say I'm much healthier as a vegan than I was as a vegetarian.	1
If you could add a rule to this subreddit without issue, what would you add?	Ban questions about relationships such as "I think my girlfriend has been seduced by untold horrors of the deep" or "My wife gave birth to twins, and one of them is an invisible abomination that defies all known laws of this earth, what do I do?" We're all tired of seeing the same questions asked every week.	If you do not post a comment when you downvote, your name will appear when one hovers over the downvote count. Just because I think it is incredibly silly for people to downvote others for giving the "wrong" answer to an open question. ("What's your favorite color?" "Blue. No green! Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhh........")	0
What do you think of Pokemon GO now that it has started to die down?	Judging by the amount of lures around at all times here, and how quickly gyms change hands, I don't think it's dying down any time soon.	Same as I thought before: not my cup of tea, and becoming more annoying every day because of how people can't shut up about it.	1
Lesbians of AskWomen, how can you tell when another person is lesbian too?	I have a 100% track record for calling it (in my head) before someone explicitly tells me that they're queer. With other lesbians I think it's usually something in the posture and gait, plus the set of the jaw and head. Lesbians tend to stand more confidently than straight women, and you can see it if you're looking for it. Having noticed it a few times, it's now the biggest 'tell' for me. However, it fails me sometimes with very feminine girls, and girls who are queer but not gay. With bisexual girls especially, I'll go back and forth in my head debating if they are queer or not. Basically everyone I've not been able to tell with has identified as bi, pan or queer.	Honestly, there really isn't a clear way without them literally telling you. The fashion that used to be stereotypically lesbian is now much more common outside of the lesbian community, and more and more women are experimenting with the androgynous look. Even if they're wearing some sort of Pride accessory, it's impossible to know what part of the rainbow they are proud of.	0
Ladies, what was the most surprising/shocking thing you learned after losing a bunch of weight?	I lost about a hundred pounds due to treatment for a disease. The biggest shock to me was how much excess skin you're permanently left with - literally pounds and pounds of just shrivelled, hanging, and repeatedly infected skin. I was miserable and almost suicidal for years, but with time and improved treatment, have gradually returned to my normal weight (~300 lbs). While I face more hatred and discrimination from others at this weight, I hate myself a LOT less. Also, I just feel 'normal' again, whereas I knew my less-fat body wasn't really me, it was like I was playing dress-up as a 'fake' thinner person.	I was surprised how pronounced my cheekbones are. I always have had chubby cheeks even when I was a skinny kid but it's crazy how different your face looks.	0
Hi ladies, what is something you would like to talk about right now but have nobody to talk to?	I'm getting fact checking fatigue and it's making me really disappointed in people and apathetic toward politics. I'm super liberal but I see just as many liberals as conservatives passing off nonsense as facts and posting stupid memes covered in lies. And then when I very politely post a reliable source that proves the lie is a lie, I get called nasty names, or sometimes they'll say "Okay, thanks for providing a source!" and then they're reposting the same shit the next day. I don't get it. You have access to the greatest information source ever to exist and yet you can't be bothered to google whatever crap your posting and liking and upvoting.	Been married five days, already received two cards addressed to Mr and Mrs [HisLastName]. I am not changing my name. I'm Ms [MyLastName] just like before. Just the fact people assumed and didn't even fucking ask me! (There are people I could talk to but I'm not gonna text them out of nowhere just to complain.)	1
To make it clear for some people, what is a relationship NOT about?	Well, a *loving and supportive* relationship isn't about winning rounds of "which of us is right" and storing up ammunition from past wrongs to use against them in said bouts.	Apparently, it's not about having someone to take you to the ER in the middle of the night or who can can inspect your back for bruises, marks, etc. Wonder what the heck they are for then!	1
I've been thinking about having an IUD put in. If you've had one put in, what have your experiences been like, and what can I expect?	Mine was great for two years. Then something happened and we never figured out what, but I was cramped over in lots of pain. It got worse and worse for weeks until I could hardly walk. I had tons of tests run with no answers. I asked my OB if there was any chance it might be the IUD and he said maybe, we could remove it and see if it helped. Day after removal all the pain was gone. Would not get an IUD again personally, but I know they work well for many.	I loved mine!! I wanted to be off hormones so I asked for the copper one. It hurt like crazy being put in and also I had this really weird stress/emotional/pain/invasive thing reaction where I cried for like ten minutes afterwards. BUT since then I feel literally nothing, I basically never need to think about it, and it works.	0
What regrettable/cringeworthy thing have you done to be the "cool" girlfriend/wife?	Not sure what that means? I think I'm going to need some examples because right now, I am interpreting this as pretending to be "cool" with things I'm definitely not okay with just to be perceived as acceptable by others? ...and I just don't roll that way.	My ex had a female writing partner, which I was genuinely cool with. However, I then continued to be "cool" as I slowly realized that a) most of what they "wrote" together was essentially roleplay sex scenes and b) she was crazy jealous of me. I never questioned him about essentially having cybersex with this woman regularly - as well as a few other women - because I felt like since this was something he wanted and I didn't want to do it, I should let him get it elsewhere. But it did wind up effecting our sex life in a negative way, and my sexuality and self image as a whole.	0
What male stereotype do you hate or not understand?	I caaaaaaaaan't stand the stereotype that men are incapable adults, especially when it comes to parenting. Ads selling cleaning or baby items are the worst for it & it makes me irrationally angry.	Thanks. The easiest way to educate oneself about a matter is to piss off someone passionate and well informed. I don't know enough about Milo as it seems. Some of the scandals you referred to are new to me. I haven't yet formed a solid opinion of the guy. The history you brought up was quite interesting. However, I do think there are examples in present day of radical groups attacking and objectifying others all around us. The was a university, for example, that changed their women's studies major to womyn's studies because they found something wrong with "men" being in the title. That is extreme and unnecessary and dozens of such examples exists. I'd name a few more but I don't have the time to do hours of research to refresh my mind. Thank you for your input. May a civilized discussion continue.	1
What is a trait your ex had that is now a deal-breaker for future partners? And why?	As it follows:Has any sort of anxiety/panic attack disorder/self identifies as crazy and keeps saying things like "you should run", I'll take those comments at face value now/anyone who's "disgustingly liberal",or anyone I have to explain to why I find it offensive when she generalizes everyone who enlists as dumb sociopathic racists who just want to murder brown people/body dysmorphia/asks me to get rid of friends/works in fashion.	Anger issues. My ex got mad at really little things, and would overreact. For example, his phone wasn't doing what he wanted it to do, so he threw it across the room, in turn breaking something else. I'll never deal with that again. I constantly felt like I was walking on eggshells so I didn't set him off.	0
Women who have broken up with a partner in order to start dating someone else, how did the the breakup/next relationship go?	I was actually the person he broke up with someone for, but it kinda answers your question. There was a very brief period of overlap (like a week at most) between me and his girlfriend (feelings, no sex) but he said he wouldn't break up with her for another three months, because she was on her year abroad in Japan and he wanted to do it in person. Then one day out of the blue he dumped her over Skype and asked me out that evening. Then 18 months later he did the exact same thing to me when I was on my year abroad in Russia. I kinda deserved it. Edit - by overlap I mean there were the feelings that come from dating without actually dating, if that makes sense. We didn't start dating until after he broke up with her.	So..I'm the horrible person who cheated and left him for that other guy. If I could change anything, I would first let him go before cheating. It was a 7 month relationship that became long distance and I couldn't handle the distance. I met another guy and we started off as fwb then eventually started dating. We've been with each other for about 7 years, married 4 and have a almost 1 yr old daughter. In my case, everything worked out great. I love him but I still feel like shit for what I did.	1
Women who moved cities with your SO or to be with your SO, how did it go?	Not just cities, but states. Move half way across the country and while it started out absolutely hellish, it has turned out way better than I expected. Adjusting from going to LDR to moving in together and being around one another 24/7 was...intense. I was used to having more 'space' and he'd never had a gf live with him. There was adjustment on both ends, we got married and like our life together, we have lots of good friends and actvities that keep us social/busy. We also have two kids, and therein was the problem. I miss my family anyway but now that I have kids is magnified it. If I see a few generations of a family at a restaurant, I'm fighting back tears because I can't share my kids with my family doing things and going places that I did. It fucking sucks.	Well not just for HIM per se, but also a job. It sucks lmao I hate my life and want to move back.	0
What do you think about the not standing up during the national anthem controversy?	To me, not standing for the anthem is a fine form of protest and if someone doesn't want to stand I think that should be legal and seen as a protest thing. In the US people are even allowed to burn the US flag in protest if desired, so I don't really comprehend why not standing up during the playing of the anthem isn't seen in a similar light. I think what complicates this issue is that the people who are refusing to stand are athletes, paid to participate in the event. I don't really know what to say there, if their employer wants to suspend them or not pay them for not standing for the anthem while they're "at work", it's a bit different than if they were refusing to stand for the anthem while attending an event they're not paid for.	My mom is a veteran and her thoughts on the matter are as follows: Take a look at everyone else in the crowd during the anthem. There are people talking, laughing, drinking beer, eating their hotdogs, getting up to go to the bathroom before the game starts, sitting with their hats still on. There are plenty of people in the crown not "respecting" the flag or the anthem so why is this guy getting attacked for it? At least he's standing up (or sitting down) for a cause he believes in. Whether you believe in his cause or not, he has a right to do it. She always says she didn't join the military to fight for only the rights that she believed in. She fought for everyone's right to freedom. And this is how he chooses to use his.	0
What poor life decision(s) do you make?	I exercise regularly, and I eat a lot of fruit and veggies, but I have one or two glasses of beer or wine almost everyday. Expensive, high-quality beer or wine. I occasionally go through spurts where I don't drink at all for three weeks, and I suddenly lose a lot of water weight and save a lot of money, and I think "Why can't I do this all the time?"	I put off important things I need to do until the last possible second due to anxiety. And I don't floss.	0
What's it like as a kid to hear that you're unequal to tasks that are 'for men'?	I was 4 and told my grandfather I wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up. He told me women could only be nurses or teachers. I became an engineer and got a job at NASA and married a (male) teacher. :) But how did it make me feel? That my grandfather was a moron.	I just realized I was better for some tasks than others. My brother wouldn't be able to help my mom with sewing- because he's uninterested and wouldn't enjoy it. Similarly I didn't want to help my dad with yard work. Oncw when we were cutting firewood, I wanted to help and my dad said I wasn't strong enough but let me try. Guess what, I wasn't and let my brother go at it. I never saw it as misogyny but that we are best suited for different things.	1
What are your tips for getting out of a funk?	I read a book once that taught me about the value of going on alone-dates. Take yourself on a date, totally alone. Explore somewhere new, see new things, get a new story you can tell to someone else - because they weren't there to see it. Learn to listen to your own thoughts again. Enjoy space. These 'dates' will always get me out of a funk.	The hug is pretty powerful. Hung out with a girl late at night one time. Just cuddled in the cool breeze for hours. ... Couldn't sleep for the next few days afterward, lol !	1
Have you ever had a prison pen pal? How did that go?	I was pen pals with a guy on death row. He was in the Latin Kings gang and ribbed a bank, shooting and killing a woman. He was very polite and a wonderful artist. He drew me a few pictures. We talked a little about his family and his day to day life and then I stopped writing. I still feel guilty. He's still alive so I might resume one day. Who knows.	My brother while he was in for about 2 years. He was using me, but I love him. The only time we ever really talk is when he's locked up.	0
What is your "OMG do I really have to explain this to you" story?	I had to explain to my sister how to get stuff from Pokestops. She's 24. I was very confused how she made it past level one without knowing.	How you don't use soap IN your vagina. A pair of dudes argued with me for like 15 to 20 minutes saying I was wrong.	0
Any single ladies here who are not on tinder or on dating sites ? Why not ?	Because I like being single. So many people forget that single isn't a stage where you're looking for a new relationship, it's perfectly possible to enjoy being by yourself without a partner.	Because I haven't been single in 13 years. A lot of online dating things were in their infancy back then, and even then, a 16 year old didn't need to be on them.	1
Ladies who are gamers: what's your favorite game and why?	I get so much crap for it, but legit Harvest Moon is my favorite game - or I guess up until A New Beginning & now it's Story of Seasons. People are like *it's just a farming game* but I like making money, taking care of cute animals, mining, fishing, establishing relationships. I think it's the nostalgia of it too, since I loved it as a kid.	I don't like the term "gamer" as an identifier for myself, but I play a lot of games. My favorite is Thomas Was Alone, probably. It's clever and tricky and simple yet infuriating.	1
Women that were friends with their SO before getting together: What did your friendship look like? How did you make the transition?	Lots of hanging out and talking, getting to know each other on a good level. Eventually, we slowly started going to dinner together and then going out to do things together. We got stuck in that period for a little while. It was like we were dating but there was no physical aspect to our relationship. I knew I liked him pretty soon after we started going out, but wasn't sure about his feelings for me. One day, I had him over to watch movies and hang out. I fell asleep with my head on his shoulder, woke up with his arms around me, and the rest is history. Each phase always felt very natural and I think it evolved well.	I don't understand the premise of the question. How could you get into a romantic relationship _without_ being friends first?	1
You're in a Lyft/Uber. While stopped at a red light the driver turns and hands you a religious pamphlet saying, "I have this little book about how much God loves you." How do you react?	"no thanks, I'm not into fairy tales." Repeat ad nauseum until stop. Get out. Leave a negativity review and contact Uber. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.	i'd probably take it, say "thanks" in a generic way, stare at my phone for the rest of the trip and leave the pamphlet when i leave the car	0
ladies, what's the first sign of pregnancy that you've had? ( the earliest one ) and how far along were you?	I'm a horse trainer, both my pregnancies the first sign was my horses/client horses all started acting weird around me like a week before my missed period. Sweetest ancient old pony suddenly lunging for my arm if I tried to touch him, huge asshole ex-bronc being super gentle and respectful, my partially blind mare who literally anyone can ride wouldn't let me touch her face, etc. In terms of my body, nausea and sore boobs around six weeks.	Missed my period. Took a test and found out I was pregnant. Less than 2 weeks...the embryo hadn't even implanted or whatever yet. So glad I found out right away.	1
How often do you wash your hair?	Every 2-3 days. I have long and thick hair so it's a hassle to wash everyday. It starts feeling gross like there's something crawling on my head if I leave it unwashed longer than that.	Day One: Clean Hair Day Two: Dry Shampoo (worn down) Day Three: Dry Shampoo (worn up in bun) Day Four: Shower or super dirty bun Day Five: plz shower	0
What's a dumb argument you had with someone recently?	I'm a self defense advocate and second amendment supporter. I once got in a Facebook argument with someone because they complained that terrorists don't get proper due process then commented that gun owners should all be shot in the back of the head without any due process. Their justification is that they did not trust themselves with a firearm. Someone else argued against me when I challenged them on a tech help forum when they said that a major retailer was selling RAM that was preinfected with malware, I simply explained that it's impossible and they got defensive and cussed me out for being a know it all. I'm a computer tech who has an engineering level of understanding with computers.	I had an argument with my husband last week about whether or not Lana Kane is ALWAYS wearing a turtleneck dress. We went back almost two seasons of us yelling at each other - "turtleneck dress!" or "no turtleneck dress!"... Conclusion: I was wrong.	0
What is some advice that sounds good on paper but doesn't really work in real life?	"Just exercise more and eat less to lose weight". Clearly this is just not working for the majority of the population, and I highly doubt the problem is people just not caring because there's all sorts of social pressure and discomfort wrapped up in being overweight.	"Live every day like it's your last." Ummm, if I did that I'd never go to work, have no savings, and would probably never put on pants.	0
As a 21-year-old female, what are some skills I should learn or habits I should start that would be useful in the long term?	Eating healthy and exercise. Make both of these part of your daily routine. Schedule shopping trips, cooking time, and gym time into your days so that you can't miss them. Prioritize these the way you would a doctor's appointment. If you think you don't have time to take care of yourself, you'll have to eventually find a lot time to recover from being sick, whether it's immediately from an injury, or down the line from a chronic illness. The best time to create healthy habits is when you're young.	You should absolutely be at least basically familiar with how to use microsoft office stuff. You should know how to make a basic excel spreadsheet, type up a word document, make a powerpoint. You should be familiar with acceptable fonts (times new roman, arial) and unacceptable fonts (comic sans) for both formal and semi-formal writing. This may seem like it is silly or a no brainer, but you should also know how to compose a clear, concise email. When applying for a job, interacting with your boss, or doing work related projects, these tools are invaluable and are often the yard stick by which other people will judge you. Learning to look professional in an electronic format is critical to your success.	1
What was your favorite date that wasn't just getting food with your SO?	not sure how "significant" my "SO" is, but he is the guy i've been dating all summer. the best date so far: middle of the day during the week. he left work early (i work from home), brought my favorite food over for lunch (chipotle burrito bowls) then helped me set up my media cabinet from cb2 that had just been delivered. i swooned! the simplest date ever, but it meant a lot to me.	We did some trespassing to take photos of run-down buildings. When dusk fell, we watched hundreds of bats fly out of an old barn. It was our second date and still my favorite one.	0
Women of reddit, does your self-esteem get better with age?	Absolutely and a good deal of that can be contributed to fully embracing the "Zero fucks given" philosophy. At 49, I literally give zero fucks about what anyone else thinks of me, and I feel much better about myself now than I did in my 20's and 30's. It's liberating.	Not really. Not for everyone, because we're all different and you just become worried about different things than when you were younger. You worry whether you look older,etc. I guess if you're married, you don't care about a lot of things, but when you're still single, your self-esteem is still tied to how people react to your looks,etc.	1
What house rules has your pet created?	Nut butter is to be shared. No exceptions. If the dog loses a toy under furniture, this is the fault of whatever human is closest. This human should fix their error and retrieve the toy. If pets are not given in a timely fashion, expect increasing nudges and wiggles until dog floof is all you can see and thus pet. All clothes come standard with hair during shedding season.	My dogs live outside in our big, fenced in back yard, but occasionally we let them come in, get a bath, and be the lazy creatures they were meant to be, but in air conditioning. They say that toilet seats can't be closed because they'll just open them anyway. They also say that it is definitely not bedtime until they have eaten every since thing that resembles food that is not in the fridge or out of reach. (No worries, there's nothing toxic that they can get to, especially because I have 2 kids.)	1
Can you rely on your SO if you're in danger?	My ex used to insist on sleeping on the side of the bed closest to the door in case somebody broke in. But I think it's one of those situations where you won't really know until you're in that situation. I imagine that dude didn't *plan* on running, but that fight or flight instinct can *make people do uncharacteristic things* sometimes.	Yeah. We're both heavily armed and rehearsed, so as much can be planned for, we're pretty ~~vigilant~~ paranoid about. Our house is set up in such a way that a break in would be bad news for the intruder	1
What was the "last straw" that ended your last relationship? Was it a sum of a bunch of little things? Or a couple big things?	A whoooooooooooole bunch of little things followed by one really, really big thing and I was like nah nope gtg	He ruined my birthday. We were out with friends and he was in a nasty mood all night. Finally he yelled at me about wanting to leave already while I was saying goodbye to my friends, and they all laid into him. Seeing my friends that upset with him because of how he was treating me, I knew it was over right there.	0
What harmless secret does your SO think he/she is hiding from you, and how did you find out about it?	My husband thinks he was sneaky last year buying me an oven for Christmas and then hooking it up Christmas Eve while I slept. I found the oven a week prior since I had to run to our storage unit for something and that's where he had hid it (to be fair, I hadn't been to the storage unit for like six months, so it was a good plan). I didn't sleep because he was making such a racket moving the old oven out and the new one in. Oh well. I acted shocked and let him have his win.	mark my words; it's near impossible to hide anything from a woman. even when we "don't know", we still had a subtle hint about it somewhere in the female intuition lands of the inner female psyche. nodnod	1
How do you find friends in a new town where you know no one? How long did it take for you to feel comfortable with your new friend base?	Join a church with lots of groups/activities, make friends through work, find a bar near you where you can be a "regular" (think Cheers). Bars typically lend themselves to easy conversations with new people. Also, taking classes is a great way to meet people.	i highly reccomend joining a a group thats either like a yoga class weekly, or a sports team like derby or something similar. Anything that meets frequently so you can do a new activity and meet other people who are into it too! Its something to bond over, rather than going out for drinks and trying to make small talk that way.	0
To women who are considered unattractive/"ugly" by others, how do you deal with the bad treatment that comes along with it from others?	In my experience, the worst (and best in some situations) thing about not being conventionally attractive is that I'm completely invisible. I don't get poor treatment from people because I'm not even acknowledged by them. As for how to deal, I comfort myself by knowing that lots of people would choose invisibility as a superpower, and I already have it!	I think that people can go screw themselves. I am not conventionally attractive by any means or what society says I should be. I find myself beautiful, my guy finds me beautiful so... does it really matter what anyone else thinks? Noooope.	1
Is there a stigma surrounding women doing "men stuff" similar to the one around men doing "feminine stuff"?	a lot of women are told they're just doing it to get attention from men. like the whole "fake geek girl" thing, where men think their dumb favorite tv show or game is so unique that no woman could possibly be interested in it, so they have to quiz you on really dumb facts nobody cares about.	If you're a cute girl? Definitely not. A pretty lady who is into wood working, metal smithing, weight lifting, home/car repair, computer building, gaming, sports, or any other stereotypical "male" activity will usually get a lot of attention from guys and women will often have a "girl crush". If you're not hot? It really depends on your attitude as to whether people will view this as a positive or negative thing.	1
What was the worst financial mistake you have ever made?	I took my dream job and a big pay cut. It was a really long commute and long hours but I loved it. After 6 months though it was clear that my finances were in the toilet. I'd lost all my savings and was struggling to have enough to eat every month. I had to quit and go back to freelancing. Took 2 years to build it all back up, and I really miss the dream job. But I'm much less stressed now.	I've never had a credit card. I honestly don't trust myself with one. I only pay with debit or cash. I'm pissed that it's expected of me to pay for things I can't currently afford and that I'm somehow weird for only wanting to live within my means. I imagine I'll get one at some point, but today is not that day.	1
Who is THAT person on Facebook whose posts annoys you?	My racist ass relatives on my mom's side who are Asian but act/think they're white, and pretend to identify with mainstream white conservative values...whenever a cop shoots an unarmed person of color, they always take the cops' side, among other gross things etc And I'm sitting here like...you're Asian, white people don't like you much, stop selling out to them, etc	Ugh for me the worst is people pushing their LuLaRoe/Jamberry/Thrive/whatever MLM flavor of the month. Edit: I lied. Worst is the girl who live blogged via FB her entire divorce and subsequent singlehood. I ended up defriending her because I couldn't watch the downward spiral anymore. Literally it was all #sadpoetry #datingmyself #missmybestfriend HASHTAGS DONT EVEN WORK LIKE THAT.	0
Tall girls, how tall are you, how does it affect your daily life, relationships, etc?	I'm 5'11". Growing up, I was always very self-conscious about being the tallest kid (let alone girl) in the room. I was called Sasquatch by some mean girls in high school. I developed a tendency to hunch to make myself smaller. I worried if I would ever find someone who likes my height. However, my fiancé is 5'10". He often complements my height ("I love how long you are" is a phrase he says often). He has really helped me feel more confident about my height.	As a 6'2" guy, I just wanna say this: I love you tall girls. Never let those shorties make you feel like you aren't the sexiest, most attractive and coolest girls in the world <3 :)	1
Online Daters of r/AskWomen, what are some of your favorite icebreaker lines that you've received?	The only 'line' that I enjoyed was one guy who messaged me saying 'does it ever bother you that lobsters are immortal?' It definitely started a conversation about harnessing lobster genes to create a team of immortal super mutants. It ended up not going anywhere for other reasons. Otherwise my now fiancé messaged me asking who my favorite Sailor Moon character was. It was from my profile and wasn't the usual barrage of 'hi sexy' crap.	Ask about the latest Netflix original series or the latest pop culture event. For example, if he thinks Trump won the debate, you know to look elsewhere.	1
Do you have anxiety that leads you to procrastinate because you fear that "it won't work out well when I do it"? If so, how have you combatted this (what helps)?	This probably sounds dumb but the only thing that helps is completely organizing and cleaning my workspaces or things that I will need to use. Like, before I can start any crochet project for instance I have to top down clean my apartment, feed the cats, sort my yarn etc etc. Its annoying but its the only thing that stops all the anxiety and worry about being a failure or generally sucking.	I've dealt with this for a long time and I've found that it's always 20x easier once you've actually started. I also tell myself "be shameless" and basically remind myself that the greatest creations & discoveries take courage. In my head, it always feels like a big deal...	0
Fide (The World Chess Federation) holds 2017 Women's World Championships in Iran, so the players must wear hijab (head covering) while in the venue and in public, because it is Iran and that's how they roll. Would you compete or boycott? Your thoughts on this decision?	As an Iranian American I don't know who thought holding the WOMENS championship in Iran was a good idea. I can attest to the fact that the country is very safe, but I personally think the laws regarding hijab are ridiculous and it was totally unnecessary to hold the championship there.	I live in Afghanistan. Headscarfing is a part of my daily life, and I fucking love it. I have crazy-person curls, so headscarfing is a super easy way to a) blend in, b) respect local sensibilities, and c) look elegant as fuck. So no, i wouldn't boycott. I'm not Muslim, but for me headscarfing is such a non-issue that I can't be bothered to care.	1
Lesbians, what experiences have you had with people misunderstanding your sexuality?	When straight women, after learning you're queer, hit on you. It's doubly worse when these women play the long-con, and end up really breaking your heart. I'm a queer, monogamous woman. I'm not simply a real-life sex toy without emotions that a straight woman can play around with until she's bored. Straight women, why do you use us like this? lol	Few things right off the top of my head: * A magic penis will save me from my lesbianism * I'm gay because someone hurt me * I hate men * I hate my dad * My sexuality is fluid/on a scale * That I'm only bi until graduation (I've never identified as bisexual) * My attraction is the same as a male stereotype's (Male gaze) * I'm too pretty to be gay I think people have these misconceptions because female sexuality is seen as servile to male's and anything that outrightly bucks that notion is treated as abnormal.	0
What are the biggest mistakes writers make when trying to write an empowering female character?	Patting their own backs about it, especially when part of the character description is "strong female role model." Give me more women like Anita Blake--hardened warriors who will kill you as soon as look at you and who give literally no fucks at all about pleasing other people, but who have a moral code that they stick to and are protective of and loyal to their friends. God, I loved that woman before she went full-on porn.	Portraying her as not having any weaknesses. It's unrealistic to have this "strong, independent woman" ONLY be strong and independent. Strong women have flaws just like anyone else.	0
Does your SO's family dislike you? If so, how do you handle it?	My SO's family loves me more than they love him I think. When I mentioned to his mom we we're dating (we had been friends long before that and his mom got drunk a lot and told me how much she wanted him to be with me) she cried and announced it to the whole family.	They dislike me and don't want my SO and I together due to my illness(es). SO and I have gone to the psychologist over it to know how to handle it. He can't cut them completely out of his life, but I have after some seriously bad shit on their part. We've made sure that we're both on the same page, otherwise it's just useless trying to have a relationship with someone that doesn't respect me or our relationship (as his family has done exactly that). He's decided on his own that no one in his family is coming to our wedding since they don't respect our relationship nor want us together.	0
Women who have toxic parents, how much did you include them in your wedding?	I'm not married but my boyfriend and I are both wanting to get married at some point. Our plans on a wedding always change so we're not really committed to the idea until we know what we both want. I've cut contact with my mother completely &, though I've never had a relationship with him, have never had anything to do with my father. They won't receive invitations to whatever I plan on having. They won't be told of it either. Luckily I don't deal with those "flying monkeys" so anything I do with my life rarely, if ever, gets back to them. My eventual wedding is for my boyfriend and I, not people we don't want there.	My situation is complicated because my dad and I are close, while my mom is toxic, and they're still together. I'd love to cut her out of my life completely, but it's not feasible while maintaining a relationship with my dad. Currently my plan is to invite them, but not accept any money from them, and it's likely that one of my friends will be assigned to run interference and keep her away from me as much as possible.	0
What do you consider to be the most casual/subversive sexist thing you've experienced?	When me and the SO were buying a new tv and on a separate occasion a laptop, I had a list of specs and things I wanted at minimum and things I didn't care for. The salesman kept speaking to my SO exclusively and trying to talk about the different products with him. Eventually I went off by myself to find what I wanted went back to the salesman for a quote and to negotiate a better price and he would keep looking at my SO and trying to convince him what I wanted was wrong so I took the quote and found a different store who priced matched it.	I am tiny. By tiny I mean 4'11" and 120 soaking wet. But I live and work on a ranch, so I lift 50 lbs fed bags all the damned time. I've gotten used to it and lifting things are easy. I get men, mostly, trying to step in and lift heavy things for me when I can do it myself. Dog food bag at the store? Hell of a lot lighter than the fed. Cat litter? Water bottles? No problem. I hate it when they say." get a man to do it." Asshole, do you wrestle with adolestant rams to make them move? Didn't think so. I can do it myself. The only time I will have people lift it for me is if it's too large for me in height and its Awkward. Or my back injury is acting up and it will hurt me.	1
Let's say you give your parents permission to choose a spouse for you. Who do you think THEY would choose to marry you to? Why?	Male here- There's this really hot family friend who I click with really well and we're very close. She goes to a prestigious university and she's athletic and pre-med and everybody who knows the both of us says we should be together. Our parents even tried setting us up several times but despite my willingness, she seems to be rather uninterested, so I also have to feign disinterest. Edit: I guess it wouldn't be too bad... I should look into arranged marriage laws. That's not legal in the US right	My mom is still sour that I didn't marry my university boyfriend. He's a lawyer now. He's still a great guy and I see him every couple of years when I'm in his city but I'm over the moon happy with my fiancé.	0
What is the worst thing about dating?	Finding out you have no connection once u meet them and still having to go through the event. (The first date) Online dating is the worst for this. Also, dating in general is very nerve racking for me if I'm genuinely interested in the person because i don't know if they're talking to other people, or if we are 'serious' as in is he just having fun or does he genuinely like me too?	When the floor in your bedroom has collapsed leading down into hell and they make a huge deal over it because they're too inconsiderate to understand that the arcane arts is cheaper than running a gas furnace.	1
What aspects of life from a woman's perspective are men most unaware/oblivious to?	When you're standing at your co-worker's desk to discuss a project and you suddenly feel a blob of uterine lining slip out of your vagina and have to make sure nothing in your expression gives it away. So weird.	The constant level of thinking about everything that goes on in a woman's brain (meaning all those identified as such as well). We never stop thinking, ever.	1
What was your favorite romantic gesture or gift from your significant other?	He gave me his grandmother's necklace. Says it all, right? Nope. I gave it back to him today, along with all of his other stuff.	Early in our relationship, a very close friend of mine died suddenly. It was shocking and terrible and I was grieving hard. My BF was unemployed at the time and one day at work I got a text from him asking if I could take a break at work, because he wanted to come by and give me a hug. It just so kind and wonderful. He had remained just as kind and wonderful since then, but that moment early on really struck me and I think of it often.	0
What's something you splurged for on your wedding day but later realized it was a waste of money/time/effort?	I had a smallish surprise wedding (it was a New Year's party and we had a quick ceremony in the middle). I spent a couple weeks before hand decorating champagne flutes, I had 50 I think. I painted them with gold glitter so that it was like an ombre coming up from the bottom, very pretty. I intended for people to use them and then bring them home as favors, but basically no one did and now I have a box of champagne flutes in my garage I'll never use. I wish I hadn't bothered, or at least I wish I hadn't worried so much about that stuff. It really didn't matter in the end.	Thanks for your feedback, ladies! :) All I really want to do is have the immediate families have supper after the ceremony & have everyone else (friends, extended family) come later on for the party/celebration.	1
Women who are unintentionally single and/or socially awkward: how do you find navigating the dating scene?	not a female here. but topic caught my eye and just chime in and say forget all the comments telling you how to attract, why to date, how to date, etc, etc. screw that. if you're quirky, it's for a reason. you're different. be picky, chase your dreams, cherish your time, most of all be you. it's time to shift the paradigm.	Hard. I know I would be an awesome girlfriend and a wonderful wife, but it's getting to that point. Men aren't interested in me, I'm very plain looking and shy.	0
(Serious) Women of Reddit with very few/no friends, How are things? How do you cope with loneliness (if you experience it) And, if you don't mind answering, Is there any reason you find yourself in such a position?	I generally prefer being alone so it doesn't really bother me. I go to the gym 4x per week so I see people there and one of the days is a group class that I interact there. On weekends I see my boyfriend and we chat during the week too. I'll usually see one or my friends once a week or so. I also go to AA meetings and I have acquaintances there. All that plus being around people at work is enough for me. I just want to be alone after a day of work + gym. Haha.	I live with my homebody best friend and two cats. I'm never lonely. I don't have many friends for a few reasons, I guess. I'm an introvert and don't particularly like socializing with strangers, which translate to not meeting a lot of people. And I prefer close friendships which not everyone is open to and which takes a certain level of "chemistry" to build, so my options are limited as is my time (since I'm spending it being close to the friends I do have). Group hangouts can be fun on occasion, but I find them exhausting by the end of it, so I wouldn't wanna do it often, so I'm not exactly in need of a lot of friends.	0
Hello, dear wonderful women of Reddit. What can Donald Trump say at tonight's debate that would make you vote for him?	That this whole campaign has been to illustrate how far American society has fallen due to the evils of the two party system. He then goes on to outline his actual platform which falls ideologically far to the left of Sen. Clinton and apologizes abjectly for letting his experiment go this far.	There's not anything he could say that would make me not vote for him. Hillary's actions speak much louder than even Trump's words.	1
It's National Coming Out Day in the USA! LGBTQA+ folk: Have you ever had a coming out experience? What was it like? Or if you are in the closet about a piece of your identity, care to talk about why?	I came out to my parents in a letter (I was 2000 miles away for college). On the same day they got the letter, my brother had a little accident with a chainsaw (it missed bones and tendons, but he has a nasty scar on his arm). My mom opened the letter after spending all day in the emergency room. She did not take it well. I think that will go down as one of the worst days of her life. Coming out to friends was a much better experience. A lot of them saw it coming and weren't surprised. For the most part, they were all really supportive.	I'm largely closeted as polyamorous, in that my family and work don't know. My close friends do, but many people just figure I don't date. I'm poly in that I've been dating guys in open relationships/marriages. It's not that I feel like *I* definitively need to be in poly relationships. I was successfully married and monogamous for almost two decades, after all.	1
What was your funniest childhood misconception?	I can remember becoming really interested in boobs and wishing that it was a mutual interest. Then I learned that it's actually fun for the lady too, if done correctly. Then I learned that it's just me that they don't want touching their boobs.	At some point in my overly religious upbringing I heard someone say "We should be teaching kids about God in schools, not handing out condoms!" Well, I was homeschooled. So I thought that kids in public school were being handed pamphlets full of sinful information and that those pamphlets were called "condoms."	0
Pet owners in long-term relationships, how do you deal with not being the "favorite"?	While I'm our cat's favorite, my husband has found some comfort in figuring out that our cat prefers to play almost exclusively with him. The cat wants to sleep, be pet by, be fed by, etc. with me, but when it comes to chasing the feather, it's aaaall him. Finding the things that you can have just-the-two-of-you is great. Maybe you could set up a way to be the only provider of your pet's favorite treat?	I'm always the favorite. I'm dominant and very good at reading animal body language. Being dominant and calm is a way to get dogs to prefer you. With cats, they just like me, lol.	1
What compliment do you feel uncomfortable about or are tired of hearing?	Honestly? All of them that come from strangers/loose acquaintances. Nobody asked you and you're opinion is worthless to me, leave me alone.	You honestly can't even tell that you were bit by a dog!!! A bit of background, I was attacked by a dog a year ago, and the right side of my face was shredded and the left side of my nose was torn off completely. It's pretty safe to say, you can tell it happened. I know it, you know it, and I'm really sick of people saying I look the same. It would make it way easier to accept how I look now if people weren't constantly pointing out how bad it is by pretending it's not there at all	0
what lies or evasions have you told to 'save face' for the male pride of men in your life?	I don't have time for that crap. I wouldn't be spending time with men who were hung up on "male pride." I can't deal with gendered nonsense in my life.	My boyfriend fibbed to friends about how I dragged him to yoga with me so he could save face and I let it go, when he really invited himself (and really enjoyed it.)	0
Women who are/were fans of "The Sims", which version and/or expansion was your favourite?	I liked the first one best. But I recently downloaded sim city on my phone and it's even better. :)	Sims 2. It wasn't perfect, but I really loved how weird it was, and Open for Business was great. I do still love Sims 3 - the customisation and open world were fantastic additions - but it ran like shit on my computer, I had to download tons of mods just to get it to work, and the sims themselves were ugly as hell. So Sims 2 it is.	0
Women who are on a diet: what food that you're not allowed to eat do you miss/crave the most?	I count calories so I can eat pretty much everything, what I miss is the amount of food I was eating. I want so bad to eat an entire pizza or a whole burrito bowl and I have no idea why. I have not once gorged myself in the last year, but damnit do I think about it all the time.	The "diet" I'm on dropped all refined carbs (anything with white flour). Surprisingly I don't crave any of it now. Refined carbs make your body crave more refined carbs. So once you stop eating them you don't crave anymore.	1
When was the last time you saw a guy cry? What was your reaction?	My SO and I found out that my great grandmother lived a block from where he grew up. I'd visit her often and we likely played together as children. He suddenly realized that this meant I probably met his mom who passed away about 11 years before he and I met. We both teared up and just sat hugging one another for a bit.	When I broke up with my last boyfriend on our 1 year anniversary. He brought roses and champagne to celebrate. I broke up with him and we both cried, drank the champagne together and then he got his playstation and left my appartment. It was pretty intense!	1
Ladies, how do you let your SO know you need more attention in a vulnerable way rather than a needy way?	I hug him for an extra-long time. He wraps his arms around me, and kisses my head, and asks if everything is okay or if I want to talk about it.	Just an honest, frank discussion. Focus on the way you're feeling rather than the things he/she does. It's ok to be needy sometimes, but talking about it in an honest way lets it come from a place of sincerity and vulnerability. Use statements like "I've been feeling lonely/isolated and I miss you, it would mean a lot if we could spend more time together, without video games/tv/other people." Hopefully your SO loves and respects you enough to not dismiss that as needy or nagging.	0
What is the cheesiest thing that your SO has ever done to you but you still love it anyway?	With my husband: Our first valentine's day, he made a playlist of some of the cheesiest R&B love songs. I had bought a massage candle and it came in the mail the same day. So, cheesy R&B love songs, dripping hot wax on each other and giving massages to each other, etc. Mid-deed, we also got the call that we were approved for our first apartment together. With my bf: He REALLY loves superman, and of course, has a really nice superman cape. He also likes to compare me to Wonderwoman, and when I was asleep on his bed, he covered me up with the cape, took a picture, and was just over the moon excited about it. Dorks. Both of them are dorks.	Sometimes when I'm grumpy he'll look at me all serious and go "what kind of pants are those?" Then he marches over and checks the tag and goes, "Just what I thought, meanie pants" It makes me laugh and breaks the bad mood. Gah I love that man. Edit: then he tells me I need to take them off :D Edit 2: Thanks for the gold whoever gilded me! First gold!	0
What's your advice for an unattractive woman?	Go to a professional and get a make over. You're probably not as unattractive as you think. Take care of your body, find out how to choose clothing that suits you. If for some reason you are unattractive even after putting in the effort, focus your energy on things other than looks and dating. There's a LOT to explore in this world and dating/marrying/having sex is over rated and the fun of it definitely fades over time. Study, travel the world, find other things that interest you and dedicate yourself to them. Looks fade, intelligence tends to last a bit longer.	like, for real for real practical advice? grow your hair super long and take really good care of it good hair is like 50% of above the neck attractiveness if not more imo probably update the wardrobe obviously weight is important also just looking like you care can read as attractive. so just by doing your hair and make-up and dressing intently i think has an effect.	1
How much does it take you to get hungover, and how has it changed over time?	I am almost 50. If I drink even a couple of drinks from a beer, I will have a hangover. If I manage to get an entire drink or entire beer down, I will be hungover for days. I have always gotten hangovers, but they have gotten steadily worse as I have gotten older. I has really discouraged me from drinking. On a bright note, since I do not drink, I just had a scan of my liver, and it is really healthy.	How much booze it takes for me to have a hangover is one of the great mysteries of the universe. Sometimes it's three or four drinks, sometimes I've had seven or eight and been fine. My hangovers have definitely gotten worse as I've gotten older though. Edit: Yes, even when I drink all the water.	0
How often do you come into contact with someone who makes your skin crawl?	Every week or so, a customer who comes into the shop where I volunteer. In lieu of a nice personality he has a small and extremely bug-eyed dog, which he uses as an excuse to force interactions. I now find reasons not to serve him as he makes me every uneasy, and I've had to stop him urging children to pet the obviously stressed and unhappy dog. We can't ban him, as he's done nothing wrong, but all the staff keep a very close eye on him now.	Every now and then I have to hang out with my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend. They are a part of the same circle of friends. She hates my guts so it's pretty awkward.	1
Those of you who have struggled with addiction, what were the early signs? How are you doing now?	I have an addictive personality disorder, so I get addicted to various things constantly, usually to replace the current addiction with something else. Generally they're short term. I've known since I was a teenager that I had predispositions to addiction, so I deliberately stayed away from most things that I knew would be the most destructive. When I do indulge, I've gone through periods of time where I have consciously had to take a break before I go too far down the rabbit hole, and that started when I was about 21 mainly due to access. Because I've known about it for a long time, and know when I want something to enjoy it versus wanting it for the sake of satisfying the construct if desire, I'm pretty good at finding the tipping point before I hit it, thankfully.	Not sure if it counts but I was heavily addicted to cutting for 5 years, I'm 2 years clean now. Early warning signs were I guess my worsening depression when I was younger and my inability to cope well with anything. I was so sad all the time and I felt like I'd finally found a way to express my sadness on my body. But before I knew it, it was a relief for even stress. I would have dozens of cuts up/down both sides of my forearms and would just always wear sleeves, even in 110 degree Southern California summer heat. I'm doing a lot better now. The urges have mostly gone, i never really think about cutting to help me cope with anything anymore.	0
What are some movies that you used to like, but started hating after rewatching them?	The Truman Show. Did no one realize he kidnapped his wife and tried to kill her with a knife? She gets treated like garbage, while he is this naive hero who (probably) gets the girl at the end.	Barbie: The Princess and the Pauper was the coolest movie in the world when I was a kid, but now that I'm older the animation is so bad that I cringe when watching it. I still have fond memories of singing "I'm a girl just like you," though!	0
Women with long term best friends, when you felt the friendship was on the way out, what were your behaviours?	I moved away for a year and she made no attempt to contact me at all. When I came back, I saw her once but by then, I realized I didn't really miss having her around. Plus, she's the kind who revolves her entire world around a boyfriend whenever she has one, which is tiring to deal with. I just stopped talking to her for the most part. She can find me if she wants to.	My boyfriend pointed out he had never met my best friend (since kindergarten) even though we'd been dating 1.5 years and she lives 15 minutes away. Her and I would text or talk daily, but never saw each other. I brushed it off because she was married with a kid. But 1.5 years and we live so close!? I finally wrote her a heartfelt email about it. She responded with a few sentences saying she didn't have time for this right now & I never heard from her again. It was the worst breakup I've ever gone through and I miss her so incredibly bad. A year or so later my mom ran into her and found out she was going through a divorce so I reached out to her with my condolences, she responded politely, but no communication since. :(	0
What are some fun "date night in" ideas?	I took my boyfriend on a sunset picnic the other day. Packed us fruit, cheese, pretzels, sandwiches and juice. Went to the dollar store and picked up plastic plates, utensils, a candle and a plastic table cloth. I then googled parks and searched for reviews on the best sunset views in my area. Found the perfect place and had a perfect evening :)	- Fondu - "Paint Nite" .. Buy supplies and follow along an instructional video (or Bob Ross, which is always amusing). You can get inexpensive supplies from the dollar store or on sale at Michaels - light some candles and do oil massages - really bad B movie night with some drinks and lots of snacks - multiplayer video games and pizza	0
What is the worst case of over sharing you've seen on social media?	Like I'll gossip with my bff about your oversharing statuses but I really try to keep in mind that it's not hurting me just because Kathy is mentally ill and needs attention. Related: I am SUPER pleased that most of the comments here are about violating others' privacy, rather than your own. NEdit: Wow the Kathy comment makes me seem like a real dillweed, so let me just say I am mentally ill and need attention like all the time. I just use different methods than angsty facebook statuses as a general rule.	The saga of my friend's baby who was dealing with constipation. Her baby was extremely constipated for a week, which I am sure is stressful since the baby was crying constantly from discomfort, but she diligently documented the events on facebook. Then posted a picture of her **exploded diaper** when the baby finally got relief. D: WHY PARENTS. WHY SHARE POOP ON SOCIAL MEDIA. (have also seen 'poop or chocolate' pictures....)	0
If you won the lottery, what's the very first thing you would buy?	I'd buy a billboard, and have it placed in front of my boss' office window, that says "LATERZ" with a photo of me rubbing dozens of $100 bills on my face.	Pay off the house for my parents. Put the rest somewhere safe. I like earning my own stuff and I wouldn't want people to know I won the lottery.	1
What's a big secret you really need to get off your chest?	I want desperately to get knocked up (tick tock) and my SO is infertile. He's totally on board with this conceptually. I don't really want to go through the rigmarole of official ways to do this, all the testing and whatnot - just want sperm. Fuck, spent my twenties not getting pregnant and now want just the opposite. Sigh - so much wasted sperm in my past, if only I'd had the foresight to harvest and put it on ice.	I just failed a law school midterm. I haven't told anyone, but when I think about it, I want to vomit. EDIT: If anyone sees this edit, thank you! You guys really cheered me up. Also, I just got my first paper back, and it has a high grade. Phew!	0
What's the funniest thing your pet has ever done?	One of my chickens got stuck in a gate. She thought she could fit through the bars but she was too phat and it was hilariously sad because somehow her wings wrapped around the bars and I was afraid she'd get injured if she exerted herself too much. She could only look at me and her friends with no expression because chickens can't smile or cry. I got her out really carefully and she was fine though.	My two cats regularly stage WWE style cage matches in the bathtub. But the ginger one is often startled by various things like his own tail or the sudden appearance of a kitchen chair that has been in the same position for at least a week, starts to run, forgets where he is in the house and slams headlong into a wall. Then wanders off, sits down and licks his tail like 'I totally meant to do that.'	0
Women who have gone to prison. What was it like?	I have been in jail a few times, but never sent to prison. It was alright, I guess. It was deserved and I should have had them come down harder on me, but I am glad they did not.	From my gf: "Extremely fucking boring. I've never felt that level of boredom before." She was in for a year.	0
What things do you do to manage your anxiety?	Mine might sound weird, but listening to familiar noises/voices. Either in music, TV shows, podcasts, etc etc. My current soother is Judge Judy and some old Dance Gavin Dance.	I have an anxiety disorder. I manage it through a small dose of sertaline, counseling, and consistently pushing myself to confront things that make me anxious. The first two are basically to help me do the last thing. As I've found that being and learning to adjust to situations that make you anxious is by far the best way to deal with anxiety.	1
If you're out in public by yourself, and you notice a woman crying near you, what do you do?	In most cases I would leave her alone. I have been that women before. In cases like that, I just hope to god that nobody sees me and really want to be left alone. Crying in public is very embarrassing. Sometimes bad things happen while you are out in public and you just cant hold the tears back. Sometimes theres not really anywhere to go or hide and youre stuck.	Ignore, pretend I don't see her, don't look at her, and continue moving. I wouldn't even know what to do or how to help if I *wanted* to.	1
Ladies of Reddit, what have you learned from Reddit?	I've learned that the reason why we are seeing so many "SJW" types gaining traction on campuses around the country and in the US is because so many people agree with that line of thinking. It's really alarming how much censorship there is on Reddit, and how common it's becoming to have a long list of opinions you cannot express because not hearing words that might be "triggering" or offensive is valued more than free speech. I fear for the society my kids are going to inherit one day.	On a different note from most of the responses, reddit has taught me how to purchase a used car and how to embroider.	0
what is something that a man/men in your life has tried to convince you is a normal thing that all men do/think/believe?	A guy I knew claimed all men go to strip clubs. I really, really hope that one isn't true. Pretty sleazy stuff, that is.	That all men want is sex and that's it. They just want sex. EDIT: because I got a couple of PMs about this. DISCLAIMER: I do not actually believe this is true, as that is NOT the point of the question. I don't believe this, nor was I convinced that this is true. Yes, there are both men and women who look only for sex. I'm not saying ALL men (or women) are like this. Thanks :)	0
Women with a different sex drive than your partner, how do you find balance?	There is no big issue about it but I'm always down for sex and he needs to be *feeling good*. Like if he's stressed or hasn't exercised or is tired he just doesn't want to. He's quite apologetic about it, which of course he doesn't need to. It can be a little frustrating sometimes, but I'm thankful we have such a great relationship I don't even remotely take it personally. Plus, he said he's always happy to get me off and that by the time he does he wants me anyway...I'm always too hesitant though because how can you say to someone who's clearly not in the mood, hey can you just finger me for a bit lol. BUT that exact situation happened the other day and it was rather excellent so I think I'm in the future I'm just gonna ask when I want it.	I am newly divorced and mismatched sex drives was a big part of it. Ideally, I would have sex every day or every other day. Ideally, he would have sex every 3-4 months. He was diagnosed with low testosterone and tried a gel treatment that didn't work for him. The doctor said it doesn't work for everyone and that testosterone injections are more effective and cheaper. Hubby wouldn't try it because "ew, needles." Low testosterone also has other side effects such as depression and weight gain, both of which were also big issues he was having. He couldn't/wouldn't get these things under control and we divorced this summer after 11 years together. I am sad that it didn't work out, but I'm much happier now that I'm not getting crushed under the weight of his depression. And I'm also getting laid much more. That's nice too.	1
Women who cohabitated before marriage, how do you feel about that decision in hindsight?	Living with my husband before we got married was the best decision. I got to see how compatible we were seeing each other day in and day out.	Marriage is a legal arrangement. There is nothing inherently special about it. Living together in love and cooperation is the thing that is important, and I would highly recommend figuring out if that is something you actually want (by testing it) before you make it a legal issue. I've lived with my girlfriend for about a year now, and it's great. But honestly, if it weren't for issues of maintaining a legal citizenship status (I'm American, she's Canadian), I doubt we'd get married at all. Frankly, not living with someone before marriage is a near perfect analogy for not looking before you leap.	1
[Serious] Women, what is your biggest regret?	My biggest regret is spending too much time in relationships where someone treated me like garbage. I did it twice, although the second time I got out much quicker.	Giving so much to cishet men. Done trusting them so they can assault me/ step on me to boost themselves. I've lost so much time & money on them.	1
How do you feel about "breastaurants" like hooters, twin peaks, etc.?	I walked into the Denver Tilted Kilt a few weeks ago because I read they had a good beer menu (they do!) I was quite surprised to find out that it was one of *those* places. The waitress flirted too much. But she might have been on something. Anyway, it was the best fish and chips I've ever had. Combination of food/beer/prices means I'll probably go back . I don't think the titties made a difference	>What is the female perception of these restaurants? I think the concept is pretty gross. >Have you ever eaten or worked there? I ate at a tilted kilt. Never again. >How do you feel about the women who work there? You do you. >What about the men who eat there? You do you. I'm not going. >Do you think working there would be demeaning or empowering? Neither. Its just a job, not a POWERFUL STATEMENT ON WOMENING.	0
What are you tired of hearing about, as a woman, about women?	As a woman and about women and from women. I'm sick of getting flack for not jumping on the feminist and BLM train. Just because I am black and a women doesn't mean I have to be part of these movements. Hell, I was even blocked by some sjw because I see those groups tip toeing on the line of being a hate group and he couldn't deal with it.	I generally don't have anything to add to these, but a coworker said a few months ago that this girl who severely sexually harassed by a guy should get over it and I should think about how embarrassing it must be for the guy to have to tell people what he did (he was arrested for exposing himself multiple times). He's a fucking grown man, he knew what he was doing.	0
Were you a bigger fan of Roller Coaster Tycoon or Zoo Tycoon? Why?	I don't think I could choose between the two. I was a huge fan of both. Making death roller coasters and releasing the lions on the zoo....what isn't to love about those games?	Roller Coaster Tycoon, definitely. I liked making people fall to their deaths. Besides, an amusement park is waaaay more fun to visit.	0
Does beauty privilege exist, in your opinion?	No, I don't think it's anything like white privilege, unless you mean racist/eurocentric beauty standards. But I think on a small scale (not having to do with race) it probably exists, like within modeling or entertainment industries. For everything/everywhere else, there's makeup which I think can be very powerful and most definitely takes skill. I'm just not sure about the idea that unattractive people experience *systemic* institutional discrimination in the way that poc do / have throughout history so that comparison to me is kinda iffy. Unattractiveness is something that can be fixed or grown out of and plus it's subjective anyway. Race isn't like that & it's not treated that way. Edit: I think I'm just defining terms differently in my head.	Absolutely, at least from my personal experience. When I was very overweight and didn't put much thought into clothing or hair or appearance, the way people treated me differently was apparent in so many ways. Once I lost weight, started wearing makeup and doing my hair, wearing flattering clothing, the difference was night and day. It was everything from store employees approaching me to see if needed help while shopping, being able to flirt my way out of something, more people wanting to be my friend, taking my opinion seriously instead of brushing me off, and more opportunities in the workplace.	0
What are your thoughts on femdom ?	It's a huge turn off for me and a deal breaker for any man who wants to sleep with me, but I don't really give a fuck what other people do.	Love it in real life but hate the porn. Maybe it was coincidence but none of the stuff I find online while looking for ideas does it for me. I guess it's because I'm into a gentler dom, and I don't really like a lot of humiliation or a lot of torture.	0
Ladies of Reddit, regardless if you've actually had children, what are your favorite names that you'd use (have used) for your real/hypothetical children? Least favorite names?	I'm a teacher so my list of names I'd never give a child is super long - I've taught too many kids called Craig, Darren, Joshua, Dylan, Sean, Emily, Chelsea, Skye and so on who were absolutely poisonous little toe rags. So many names have been wrecked for me! A colleague had a baby recently and spent most of her pregnancy agonising over names that she liked and that didn't have terrible associations for her.	I HATE children, but I like the names Charlie and Olivia (after Olivia Dunham obviously). I could type out the names I hate, but I'm sick and it would be at least 100 names, and I'm sure someone would get offended by one of the names on the list.	1
Ladies of Reddit, what's your side hustle?	Does it only count as a "side hustle" if you do it on top of a full time job? Because at one point I was working 80 hours a week at three different, part time bartending jobs. Which one was my side hustle? Or were they all side hustles? Or was I simply just "working" and needed to pick up knitting for an Etsy shop if I wanted to hustle "on the side"? ... I think this came off more aggressive than I meant, lol. I just hate the term "side hustle" and tend to consider work is work is work. When I was cash strapped I simply picked up extra shifts at my current jobs or found another one that fit into my schedule in order to make more money. Just regular hustle.	I hand knit chunky scarves and do manicures on the side at my college. I live in the Midwest so college girls keep me p busy.	0
Which qualities are important to you in a future pizza?	Pizza is one of my least favorite things. I get that statement is an abomination, but there are just too many other foods I prefer.	They need to be hot, but not too hot, that's intimidating. And while I can appreciate a certain level of cheesiness, I don't want them going overboard.	0
I, 21M, was just sexually assaulted at a club for the first time and am furious. Can't believe you ladies deal with this constantly - how do you do it?	I'm a lady. I don't deal with this constantly. No, I'm not ugly. Just wanted to point out that not all women are harassed constantly.	The British TV station Channel 4 commissioned a small study for its *Dispatches* program in 1995. Of the 81 cases of male sexual victimization that they looked at -- 60 of which were penetrative rapes, and 21 sexual assaults of some other kind -- the *least* common response among male victims, at 17%, was physical resistance. 23% tried to talk their way out of the situation. 60% froze, reacting neither physically or verbally. It's almost the default response, for both sexes, in these kinds of situations.	0
Have you ever been gaslighted, or suspected someone of trying to gaslight you? What happened, and what did you do about it?	My dad is a classic emotional abuser. His favorite thing is to move or hide other people's possessions, mail, etc and insists that they never were there. Second favorite is to scream insults then act confused and hurt when you react in kind. I've taken to gaslighting him back by saying how concerning it is how he keeps forgetting things and maybe he should be tested for dementia.	This is only slightly related, but my mom often suspects me of gaslighting her (not using this specific term, though). I don't have a reputation for being deceitful, but as a former rebellious teenage girl I've told my share of lies to her. often, when she remembers something incorrectly and i dispute it, she will accuse me of trying to trick her. in reality, she's starting to get old and some of the finer parts of her memory are fading.	1
For those who have been cheated on, looking back, did you know something was off while it was happening? How did it affect your relationship even when it was a secret?	I figured something was up, but wasn't sure. He was very good at lying and covering his tracks. He worked odd hours at the law enforcement center so if he picked up extra hours here or there I didn't think anything about it. That also meant he was rarely working during the hours I was. I actually had someone tell on him to me anonymously on Facebook. Confronted him and more lies. Eventually the shit hit the fan when I was contacted again by someone else that sent me proof. He had been cheating for years with several different women over the course of our marriage. Took me a while to pick myself up and realize I didn't deserve that treatment and no one does. Getting screwed in the head for years takes some time to undo.	The first time, I knew. He was distant and as stupid as it sounds, there was one girl who was posting weird things on his Facebook (she later posted something about them dating on Facebook and that's how I found out!) The second time I had no idea. We were solid, we were talking all the time, we were open about our feelings. I knew he was panicking about a recent commitment we were taking, so I was ready for him to have a freakout, and he just wasn't having it... well, that I knew about.	1
Ladies who aren't on birth control: are you going to get an IUD after last night's results?	No, I'm still relying on condoms. They've worked just fine so far. I don't expect the pill or IUD will become illegal even with Trump in office.	I was planning on waiting a few years to get a tubal and just using an IUD. Now I'm going to make that happen next year. Actually, I might call my doctor tomorrow and schedule an appointment to talk about it.	0
women of reddit, what are some awesome small/cheap presents you'd like to receive?	Flowers... I've only ever gotten flowers twice (I think it's super cute when the guy picks them instead of buying them) lol something I need, or something that reminded him of me. It's not really about the object more so they were think about me when they didn't have to be. It makes me feel special 💚	Could be anything. I appreciate the sentiment of "I saw this and it made me think of you and I had to get it for you" way more than whatever the thing is.	0
How big of a red flag is it if your SO lies about their whereabouts?	If you're partner is the type that like privacy it might be nothing. Might also be red flag. I like privacy and I really dislike if someone ask me were i am going, what I have done and what I browse on the internet and so on. Usually I have no problem telling them but if its something i am not to proud of I do not want to talk about it. But if I had a really close partner it would have to be a person I would share almost anything with.	Lying is a deal breaker, especially about something like that. If you're lying to me about where you are you're probably doing something I won't like. It's a compounding problem that will only get worse.	0
For first-time dating, would you use an app where you just remove the pics of people that you don't want to meet, then out of the remaining you get a date within 45 minutes, at a bar close-by?	I would not meet up with someone purely based on pictures, and not within an hour of hearing about their existence. I also wouldn't meet at a bar I had no choice in, the ones closest to me are sketchy as fuck.	To me writing and texting hurt every inch of my body and I feel that the information gained by doing so is 0. I basically never date online because other girls want to write for weeks before meeting. I prefer that their profile answer the questions I have. I prefer to just meet as quick as possible. That is why I go out and meet people for real.	1
What are some common sentiments you see on Reddit about dating and relationships that you disagree with?	That it is someone's fault. Sometimes shit just doesn't work, sometimes people don't mesh, sometimes people grow apart and change, sometimes life isn't fair, and sometimes the only thing you can do is concede with grace, walk away, and move on. Placing blame on someone for every situation seems small minded. The universe is complex and sometimes it isn't anyones fault. It's okay to feel about it, but it isn't fair or helpful to be placing blame all the time. You force someone else to be the victim of your inability to process effectively. It's a feedback loops of ugly things and ineffective coping skills.	That infidelity of any kind indicates a lack of respect for the partner who was cheated on and that the relationship should be ended immediately.	1
What is something that someone close to you is in denial about?	One of my old friends is an alcoholic. We've tried to talk to her about it many times, and so has her family, and she just doesn't get it. Same woman is also confused as to how she's "mysteriously" gained so much weight in the past 8 years when her twin sister hasn't and they eat the same stuff. It doesn't take long around them to see that she eats twice as much as her sister on top of drinking about 10x as much. We've tried to explain to her - gently - about calories in alcohol and such but she just refuses to acknowledge the problem.	My roommate is in complete denial about everything. From how much she sucks at life, how bad of a friend she is, to how her failed relationships with everyone around her is their fault. Also how toxic she is being in her relationship, and how lazy her boyfriend is. It's hard to be around, so I just avoid her	1
What is your job? How much money do you make? Would you recommend your role to others?	I am a bank teller for a nation wide bank. I make about 13000 a year but only work 20 hours a week. I get amazing benefits including legal services and 24/7 therapy. The company all together is very customer and employee focused. Tons of opportunities for career options. I personally don't like my life to be focused on work much rather on my family and son. I would definitely recommend my job. You do unfortunately work around a lot of females so it gets a little tough.	Crime data analyst for a private corporation. I made 42k a year starting out, and make 52k with two years of experience. It's really interesting work but the pay isn't fantastic considering I have a Masters degree, and there can be weird personel issues as well. Private companies pay better than state and city governments of course, but the government pay is so low that the companies don't have to go much higher to lure people in. I love crime, but I'm thinking of changing industries because the pay is better in finance or healthcare.	0
What's the most petty reason you've lost interest in someone?	He was waay into smelling his own shoes. Like the first time I went over to his place he pulled off his shoe and took a nice, deep whiff of it. We're just sitting in his living room, chatting, and out of no where he needs a cleansing breath. Who the fuck thinks this is how you impress a girl?	I met a perfect looking, smart, very well educated, impecably dressed petite brunette. Our conversations were great, the sex was mind-blowing (as well as dick-blowing), and even our wardrobes were a perfect stylistic match. Alas, she was an objectivist and considered Ayn Rand to be a brilliant philosopher.	1
Ladies, amount of sex you want vs. amount of sex you actually have?	Women want sex all the time apparently. But shun anyone in this sub who mentions random approaches or a slight hint of a prospective suitor taking chances to meet new people. Aka: fuck off, but I really do want sex ....here come the downvotes, possible deletion.	I want it once every few days. I end up having it almost every day. My husband is very persuasive.	0
Girls: what things guys like to do to each other that you don't understand and hate?	"Just joke around". No, you're pretending it's "just joking" for some kind of asinine masculinity-proving bullshit. This is why you never discuss any of your feelings and problems with your male "friends" and dump it all on me and other women in your life.	Guys never compliment or are never affectionate with each other. I see a lot of men here are upset that they never get complimented but 90% of my compliments are from other women. Its like their afraid of being seen as gay.	0
Have you ever completely lost respect for a friend because of something they said or did? What happened?	One ex-friend pretended to have incurable thyroid cancer (given survival rates of this type of cancer she should have faked other type to be more convincing). Another friend/roommate started dating guy I was seeing behind my back, moved in with him and didn't pay her portion of rent in our apartment. The landlord couldn't get in touch with her so he called me several times a week asking about her. F*ck them. I have better friends now.	I've had several male friends in the past reveal themselves to be sadistic or racist. So I cut them out of my life and now I don't make friends with men.	1
For those of you who visit those community NSFW self posting subreddits such a GW why isn't there a positive representation of men on those pages?	"The female body is....a work of art. The male body is utilitarian. It's for gettin' around. It's like a Jeep!" - Elaine Benes ITT: women who hate Elaine's quote. Reminder, this isn't /u/breachofcontract's quote. It's a simple take on a simple question. Isn't the downvote button for those that don't contribute to the conversation and not a disagree button? My actual answer is posted above; it's supply and demand. Women don't demand male posters on GW as much as men demand female posters on GW.	there's /r/ladybonersgonewild also I imagine that guys who post on gw would get downvoted by straight men who are outraged at having to see a naked man.	0
Today an older lady approached me to say that I smelled 'lovely' and asked what perfume I was wearing. Has this happened to you? What were you wearing? Have you asked the question yourself?	Sort of. I was hugging my best friend in high school when he suddenly said "You smell really good" and hugged me again and actually *inhaled deeply*. It was just shampoo.	I'm a happily married man and I often want to tell women that they smell good, but I have yet to figure out way to do it without sounding creepy. It's not a sexual thing or me trying to proposition them or anything. I just think someone should let them know that they smell nice. (I even just creeped myself out a little typing that...)	1
Parents of Reddit, in what ways has your child(ren) reminded you of yourself when you were their age?	My son is clever but not smart. He lies when it's easy for him to do so and gets him out of work. He listens only when he wants to. He's pulling a ME and he just started school. He's going to be devious, lazy, and quick witted and probably get on the nerves of more than few teachers.	My mum says that her mum used to say "you have an answer to everything" and my mother never knew what she meant by it until I started coming out with answers to everything	0
What was your "well,this is who I chose to spend the rest of my life with" moment?	Heard a bit of a commotion in the living room last night (bf is having a few beers) went through and he had scratches all over his forehead?? Turns out he tried to wear the cat as a hat and she didn't like that much...he's 33. This is what I have to deal with. Plus he starts a new job today.	It was just after we had gotten married. He had never done it before we got married, but he started doing passive aggressive stuff. He would go for 2 weeks without talking to me and I would never know what I had done. We have been married 25 years now. He still does it, but not as much, probably because I don't give a shit anymore if he's pissed about something he won't tell me.	1
To women who start work early: Do you ever apply your makeup when you get to work?	I am the first person at work so have no issue doing it there (in the bathroom of course, but I arrive half an hour before anyone else so it's never been an issue). Means I get to sleep in an extra 15 minutes. Worth it! I don't care if the people on the tram see me without makeup, I may as well look like a zombie while in feeling like one.	I'm a dude, so can't really weigh in as much as others but I would either a) run it by my boss, so they know why I'm spending 30 min not working and applying makeup. I'd rather a heads up as a manager, but I'm sure they'd be 100% fine with it or b) ask if I could start my shift earlier or c) if you work somewhere that is in a location with bathrooms somewhere else, go do my makeup there	1
What's the funniest or most interesting conversation you've ever overheard?	One kid to another kid at the supermarket. "Have you ever eaten chicken feet?!" Heard it the other day as I walked right by them. XD	Overheard my professor and a classmate talking the other day. Professor: Oh you used to be a hooker?? Student: Yeah! When I was a lot skinnier though haha. Professor: That's great! I was a hooker in high school! Turns out they were talking about rugby. Woops.	0
What has been a large source of drama when visiting family?	not visiting my mom often or long enough. we dont live in the city where his and my family lives. so we mostly stay at parents-in-law because they have a house. we sleep there, eat there. and of course the kid has a way better relationship with them than with my family (which i find really really sad!) and everytime we visit them we stay about 2-3 hrs for coffee and cake and thats it. you see, there is a huge difference in my parents and his parents from the social status and thats one of the reasons we dont visit my parents that often. and now that my sister is pregnant my mother will have a favorite grandchild living like next door and my child will probably be left out somehow. i dont know if it will but i can see it coming..	Probably the top one is that I don't call/visit enough, which leads to me being screamed at because I "owe" them more visits and calls. Really makes me want to visit more /s	0
Stardew Valley players! What's your farm like? Who did you romance? What are you working on?	I made a orchard where I produce fuckton of fruit wines of various types. I also have a few animals of various types, including a void chicken!	OK, so I had never heard of Stardew Valley before this thread but looking through the comments, it sounded an awful lot like Harvest Moon which is one of my favorite games ever. I just looked it up and I think I'm in love again! Not that I need more convincing, but would anyone care to tell me what they like best about the game? If you've played Harvest Moon, what are some commonalities/differences? Also, can I only play it on the computer?	0
Women of Reddit, when has doing the right thing ever backfired on you?	Not a woman buy tried to help drunk lesbians in the woods, ended up going to jail that night because I had some weed over at my campsight	One time I was at school and went to get Starbucks. It was cold and rainy. There was a homeless guy across the street, so I bought him a hot chocolate when I got mine. When I went to go give him his drink, another homeless guy showed up. I didn't drink any hot chocolate that day.	0
What are some red flags when talking to people online?	Signs or admission of depression or mental health issues. May be unfair, but ... long ugly story. I just run away when I suspect it.	Two things that would make me cut contact immediately are: - they get impatient or needy waiting for your replies - they don't respect your boundaries	0
Frizzy medusas of Reddit, what are some do's and don't's regarding your mane of snakes?	Medusas? I'm seeing a lot of people with curly hair replying, but that's usually a term for women with dreadlocks. Can you clarify?	No hairbrushes. Ever. No sulfates. Much conditioner. Don't play with hair unless you want to look like a crazy cat lady. No tight braids, no tight elastics, no heat styling. No ammonia in hair color. When shampooing, wash scalp only. Leave conditioner until right before exiting the shower. No fluffing hair with a towel- wrap it (just tight enough to stay put) and leave it alone.	0
What's the absolute worst piece of advice you've ever listened to, and what was the result of doing it?	"Look, walking can't hurt and pregnancy is no excuse to gain weight because you're already fat." As it was I was so sick I had lost weight, and it turns out walking can indeed hurt. Not only did I have high blood pressure, I had mild pelvic dysplasia and SEVEN FUCKING YEARS LATER my pelvis, hips, and lower back will all slip and twist because of the damage done by 'just go for a walk' being said to me every time I ever talked to anyone about anything (tired? Walk more! Sad? Walk more! Feel sick? Walk it off!).	Not me but somebody told my friend that cooking oil works better than sunscreen Cue massive blisters and completely burned	0
What is a white lie that blew up on you?	Was staying at my MIL's house. Took her clothes out of the dryer to do my own laundry and put them back in when I was done. She later asked me if I did laundry and I said no. She called me out because the settings on the wash were different than what she usually uses. Said she felt "lied to" and now makes it very obvious that she no longer trusts or likes me. I never thought I'd be the SO that a MIL hated.... but I made it.... because I lied about doing laundry.	I often tell people I don't have a smart phone if they ask me to download an app or use navigation on my phone or something. This happened at a work conference and my manager got irritated when he saw me using my phone later, after I told him "I don't have a smartphone" as a reason I didn't download the conference app. Yes, I do have a smart phone. Unfortunately, it's a Windows phone, and most apps don't even bother making a Windows OS version of their app, so I can't use them. But explaining that to people is a pain in the ass so it's easier to just say I don't have a smart phone.	0
Childless, unmarried, 30+ ladies, how is your life?	Later this month I'll be 33. I'm also getting married for the first time just before my birthday. No kids, I hate my life except for SO. He's the only good thing to happen to me since I stopped believing in Santa Clause. Fuck Obama, fuck liberals, fuck the GOP. But don't go by me, I've been especially unlucky.	I'm about to turn 39, single and no kids. I'm super lonely and regret how things turned out. I'm trying to think of how to adapt and make the best of it.	0
Eggnog or nah?	I think it's nasty. I think it smells bad and tastes worse. I think coffee and tea are nice year round but especially in cold weather. I also like the occasional hot chocolate or mulled wine around Christmas time	Fuck yes eggnog! I make it with much less sugar than the recipe calls for and double up on the bourbon. And it must be cold. Warm eggnog is an abomination.	0
Single ladies, what was your last dating/sex disappointment?	This guy tried so hard to get me to go out with him for about a month. I finally gave in and after 3 dates or so, he had started to win me over. On date 6, I told him so and then he confessed that he was still getting over his last girlfriend and thought I could help him get over her since I "looked" like her!!! So creeped out and angry because of the time wasted.	A guy who didn't measure up to my penis size criteria. Kind of sucked to get naked and see him lacking for me. I bailed before anything else happened. Though I was able to score another guy for the night.	1
What's your worst consensual sex experience?	Had one woman pause halfway through sex to go to the bathroom, ended up ruining the second half. That was the last time I saw her. Had another one that made absolutely no sounds. It was literally just me breathing heavily and the creaking of the bed. That was the only time I had to fake orgasming just so the sex could end.	Hooked up with a coworker and he only liked the most vanilla sex imaginable. He hated if I wanted a faster pace, didn't want me to touch or kiss him at all once he was inside. He just wanted to put his penis inside me and let it marinate until he came.	0
Currently eating a block of cheese, what's your go to snack?	Tonight I went to the grocery store with full intentions of getting vegetables for stir fry for dinner. I came home with egg nog and crispy minis	Carbs. Nom nom nom. Delicious sugarsss. Or fruit when I'm trying to convince myself that eating copious amounts is still healthy.	1
How do you feel about tending to your parents when they become old and need care?	I won't do it. I wouldn't want my kids to care for me, either. That's would be selfish and entitled of me to assume it of them. I can't anyway. I'd rather pay someone to do it.	Honestly, I worry about it a lot. I'm an only child, I'm barely scraping by financially, my parents have no money, and they don't care for their health as well as they could. I'll absolutely help care for them in whatever capacity they need but I'm worried I won't be able to.	0
Girls who like to workout. What is the most uncomfortable situation you've been in at a gym?	I worked out at the local stripper gym because it was the closest to my house and open 24 hours. (Stripper gym because the guy who owned tons of local strip clubs bought all of his dancers memberships there, so there were always tons of exotic dancers there working out.) I made it about 6 months before canceling my membership because a lot of the men working out there felt very free to comment on, approach, or touch the women working out there. Sure, lots of those guys got kicked out by management, but it seemed like there were always dozens more ready to take their place. It sucked, though, because the women are all very sweet and supportive of each other.	WOW, Im shocked, 159 comments, and not ONE of them about a trans woman in a locker room? Is everyone here from North Carolina? Shocked, SHOCKED I say! /s	1
Those Who Have Been Gaslit, How Did You Learn To Trust Your Emotions Again?	My ex tried to gaslight me by telling me I knew she was her other lovers slave (my one, only and last poly relation). Yeah, they were in a dom/sub relationship when roommates while I lived 2 hours away. I later found out he was dropping her into subspace 2, 3 times a day and reprogramming her in his image. I don't know if i will trust again but I do know the experience changed me... and not for the better.	I became Sherlock. Started carrying a little pad of paper and pen. Wrote down specifics that he said and when. Then, when he invariably changed his answer, I could prove to myself that he was full of shit. He was full of shit. Actions speak louder than words, big time. But, words count too, when speaking of gaslighting.	0
What are your cheap, homemade lunches that make your working day better?	I generally try not to eat during the day, but when it is super cold out and I need something cozy/cheap I always like a nice chunky tomato basil soup.	Chicken salad with crackers. I buy a rotisserie chicken at Costco and pick it clean, then dice it up real fine. Finely diced celery & white onion, a little mayo, a squirt of ranch, and dill. It is so light and fresh and doesn't give me that afternoon draggy feeling.	0
Women who have had abortions, how did you feel afterwards about the man who got you pregnant?	We're engaged (and got engaged afterwards), so obviously it didn't change much about our relationship. He was extremely supportive and very hard on himself about it all. I don't blame him at all, and if anything, he definitely showed me he can be relied on in a crisis. It made us closer if anything.	I have had 2. The first guy I resented definitely, but not because of that. He was just generally a bad person and no way could I ever have a baby with him, he was abusive. The second one, I do resent him, but it's really not his fault. I never told him anything about it, so my resentment is totally unfounded. Just a product of my own emotions, I guess.	1
Right-handed folk dating lefties; what are some unintended challenges related to your handedness?	So, I'm a lefty, but my SO is right handed and the only issue we run into is sitting next to each other at dinner. Sit on the wrong side and we're bumping elbows all night.	This question does not run afoul of our majority demographics rule, as it is directed at right handed people *dating left handed people*. Most right handed people date other right handed people. Hah, reporter. Out-pedanted! However, left handed people dating right handed people should feel free to answer as well :p.	1
What is considered crossing a boundary in a relationship to you?	I don't care if you don't like that guy that I'm working with, you do NOT tell me who I can and can not hang out with. I don't care if you think my skirt is too short, you do NOT tell me what I can and can not wear. I don't care if you think I'm going to make the wrong decision, you do NOT tell me what I can and can not do. If he has a problem with that guy, outfit, or decision, talk to me like a competent human being and we can work out something together.	If you're doing something you feel like you need to hide or lie about, that's probably not a good sign.	0
(Trigger Warning, SH) Ladies of Reddit, to counter the ridiculous "Nice Guy" (TM) claim that, "It's only harassment if he's ugly but flirting if he's hot", what are some incidents where you've been creeped out or harassed by a guy you considered very physically attractive?	When I'd just started speaking to this guy from college. He did the whole "i don't know why I'm single I guess I'm not hot enough", I said "Oh you're attractive though" and he said "yeah I'd love to stick my dick in you" That's not what to say on the first conversation.	I'm sure someone must have already said this, but I do think there'd be some truth to that claim! I think that if you did some kind of study, you'd find that guys' advances would be more likely to be written off as creepy, or whatever, if the guys are unattractive. Whether that's because of women being shallow, or because unattractive guys are less likely to be confident/socially competent, I wouldn't have a clue, but I think there'd be some truth to the idea :)	1
What community do you think comes with a lot of 'gatekeeping'?	Gaming (both video and board/tabletop/card). The only stores I've gone into and felt uncomfortable in, like I was intruding. I went for the midnight launch of Fallout 4 and was standing in line playing games on my phone to kill time and the dudes in line behind me were being complete assholes about that, like I'm a fake gamer for playing mobile games, like OKAY GUYS I'LL JUST HAUL MY CONSOLE, TV AND A GENERATOR TO THIS PARKING LOT AT MIDNIGHT TO WAIT IN LINE, seriously.	This one. Edit* To anyone reading this, I have since been banned and muted. Read what I have written and you decide if it was appropriate.	1
Which is best: live birth, pouch babies, or egg-laying? What makes your preferred option superior?	Pouch babies for sure! Marsupial babies are so tiny when they first emerge to crawl into the pouch, like little jellybeans, you would barely feel it. Then once they get big you wouldn't have to waddle around heavily pregnant all the time, you could let them out for a bit and take a break. Plus, you could carry your youngsters and still have both hands free to do other stuff. Marsupials have it all worked out.	We lay eggs, though. I mean... you guys.... we do. OVAry... you know? OVulate? We lay eggs, they are just tiny and (probably) not as good when paired with bacon. It's possible I'm putting way too much thought in.	1
What are the most common misconceptions that men have about how women experience sex?	I always find it funny when I come across a guy who legit thinks that women don't enjoy sex and use it for manipulating men. My automatic conclusion there is that he's horrible in bed, ha.	This is a good post, but I honestly feel that most men on this subreddit are probably already aware of most of if not all of these bits of information. That being said, still good to hear again.	1
What is the most disgusting thing you've seen on Reddit?	That guy who defended pedophilia and bragged about raping a 9 year old. Edit: And the ones about Carl H.	Mostly abject sexual degeneracy: theredpill, people claiming sex with underage people/animals/children/family members is morally ambiguous, some girl who had slept with over 100 men, and some guy who as a fetish got his balls chopped off. I don't know what it is about gross sexual stuff/attitudes that I hate so much but I really do	1
What's the weirdest way you've heard yourself described?	My friend: You're a good person and always willing to help but can you not be a troll everyday? Sounds about right...	My friend told her other friend that I was "The Leslie Knope of Gift-Giving" which was pretty awesome to hear.	0
Anxious people, when did you have the realization that your anxiety was more extreme than normal?	When it got bad enough that I couldn't do things that I needed to do, like go outside to get food or do laundry, because I was afraid of people seeing me. Before that I just thought "everyone gets nervous, everyone freaks out sometimes, it's normal." In retrospect, a lot of my behavior in the past was very much not normal.	When I cried in class so often that people started to bully me and nobody wanted to be my friend. I was only 11 when I started on anxiety meds.	1
In retrospect, what were the little signs that your partner was falling in love with you, or you with them?	I feel him kissing my forehead/shoulder/back of my head, in the middle of the night, when he thinks I'm 100% asleep	With my husband it was stuff like holding hands or sending me extra cute texts. With my boyfriend it was the addition of hand holding and forehead kissing during our normal kinky sex.	1
How bad does IUD insertion actually hurt?	My GF just got her second one (after her first one fell out after a few weeks - luckily she noticed). Hate to tell you, but she described it as the worst pain she ever had...	It was very uncomfortable for 2-3 minutes, then I had a day of period-like cramping which was relieved by Advil.	0
Donald and Ivanka got me thinking. How is your relationship with your father?	Great. When I was a kid, my dad didn't interact with me much. I have since found out this is because he, like me, has no idea how to interact with children. As an adult we have long conversations about work, friends, social problems, etc.	My dad is cool. He rides motorcycles and plays bass. He's always been super supportive of everything I've done and helped get me through undergrad financially and otherwise. Now, I'm almost done with my Ph.D. and he is very proud. He's retired and divorced now. He works on doing his own stuff for the most part since me and my brother are much older now.	1
Have you ever encountered a sociopath? If so, what's your story?	We have one as our president elect. The Trumpanzee is very clearly both, a sociopath as well as a narcissist.	My friend's younger brother was diagnosed as a sociopath in his teens after attempting to kill her several times as a child. I only met him once, and even knowing he was diagnosed and knowing the signs, he seemed fine, charming even. My only memory of him involves singing karaoke together with him at one of their family events. He struggled with various drug addictions as an adult, and died of an overdose last year. It's been very difficult for his family because it's both terrible and a relief to have him gone at the same time, and then of course they feel guilty for being relieved.	0
Have you ever found someone on Reddit you knew in real life? What kind of stuff did they post?	Not quite what you asked, but my mother found me on here. She was in /r/raisedbynarcissists and saw one of my posts. She knew it was one of her kids, and I'm the only redditor in the family so she figured out it was me. She printed off my posts and showed them to everyone that we know. It was horrible. In the end, I decided not to start a new account. If she wanted me to tell nicer stories about her, she should have treated me better.	I found out a friend was a redditor when he shared a link from TIL on facebook. Never found him here, though.	1
Women working in STEM, what is your occupation and how did you get there?	I'm currently halfway through a master's of urban planning and environment. It's contested as to whether it is a stem field because it falls under the umbrella of social sciences, but we work in areas such as geography, cartography, GIS, economics, demography, statistics, and with engineers. Some people consider it stem, others don't. It's sort of in the middle of it all I guess. It's a very all encompassing field depending on what you specialise in. Edit: NSF says we are STEM Wooooooo!	I'm a graduate student in Logic, Computation, and Methodology! I was given my own computer at the age of eight and I learned HTML and CSS. Then I started working at fourteen doing web development for real estate companies all over the US. I used this money to switch to private school. In college I changed my major every week freshman year before deciding to make my own. I had to petition an academic board and work closely with faculty to design my major, but it was approved! I graduated in May, and now I'm at Carnegie Mellon concentrating on modal logic to diagram technical systems. :D	0
Do you believe feminism has a place in modern society? Are you a feminist? Why or why not?	Yes, feminism is much needed in today's society, especially in my culture. The majority of men in my country have only just learnt about the concept of feminism, and a distressing number of them are immediately associating it with man-bashing. They do not bother to actually educate themselves on the history and significance of feminism, yet they are quick to blurt out insults and threats on feminist women, safely hidden behind the anonymity of the internet. And yes, I am a feminist, because I believe people of all sexes and genders must have equal rights. I am also pro-LGBTQ for similar reasons.	Jesus fuck. How often do we have to have this topic? I don't identify as feminist, and I'm relatively critical of the modern movement, and even I'm sick of seeing this come up all the damn time. Yes, it has a place in modern society. I have some disagreements about how they're going about things lately, but over all there's still a lot to be done.	1
What things do men say to try and be caring, but achieve the opposite?	When faced with any mundane decision - "I don't care, I'll let you decide". Like it's a favor to me to have to choose dinner, date location, movie, etc. every single time. To be fair I'm sure this isn't a man specific thing.	"Text me when you make it home." No, I'm a damn independent woman and can walk 10 blocks in my own neighborhood just fine. (I know some women like that, but I don't)	1
What do wish you could tell your 20 year old self?	You WILL gain a shit ton of weight from all the beer and fast food you consume. You DO NOT have a "really good metabolism".	"Don't be a wuss, get a dealer and learn to roll." Granted I'm still 20. I might be glad for this later in life.	1
What scene from your life, whether wonderful and beautiful or utterly painful, do you often replay in your head?	My fiance coming inside from having a smoke. She stated she was dizzy and the fell to the ground seizing. She went brain dead and died a week later. The experience wakes me up most nights.	This was a fairly recent moment, about a little more than two weeks ago. I had just met up with a girl I met back in August. After having In and Out and a lengthy conversation, with an intense make out session, I drove her back to the place she was staying at. While I was driving and she was in the back seat stroking my hair and holding my hand, the song from The Weeknd and Daft Punk 'I Feel it Comin' was playing. The MJ vibe and the lyrics to the song spoke to us, and to the intimate moment we had. Just gotta wait at least a few more weeks to see where things go for us.	1
Aside from feminine goods, what supplies would make a good care package for homeless women?	If you take away all the feminine goods, then there's no need to differentiate between male and female homeless. In other words, socks.	Socks! Socks socks socks Deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste. I just know most shelters say they are in desperate need of socks and no one ever donates them	0
What quality do you look for in a man that you feel like men often overlook?	The ability to admit they don't know. One of our first dates with my husband, my car was having trouble. I asked him if he could look at it. He said, "I can open the hood and stare at it and tell you it's an engine, if that's what you mean. But I haven't a clue what would be wrong with it." I've been with SO MANY MEN (dad and brothers included) who feel they have to solve it even if they don't know. I love a man who can admit they don't. And then go out and get the learning to know in the future.	Don't need a provider. Want a partner. Been making my own fucking money since I was 14, when I started tutoring.	1
What sexist tropes are you tired of seeing in TV/film?	Nerdy/dorky/ugly girl needs to be "fixed" to get a man/rule her country/save China. Smart women are only well educated because they are socially awkward and couldn't find a man yet. (Then they meet the hero and quit being a doctor/scientist/spy.)	Why the fuck does every female main character need a stupid romance plot? Guys do not, so why do women?	0
Parents, how have your sex life changed after having kids?	It's the same. Doesn't happen. I am not with her dad. Haven't since she was born. Don't have a live in SO. I'm also asexual so I don't really give it any thought until I see questions like this.	It is like being a teenager again, except instead of trying to find a place where my parents won't catch me, I'm trying to hide from my children.	0
Ladies, who is a celebrity that men goes nuts for and you just *do not* see it?	Jennifer Lawrence. I don't think she's hideous or anything, but I think if she wasn't famous and guys saw her walking around the mall, nobody would look twice at her. I think Charlie Day is incredibly hot.	Honestly, all these goddamn white ladies. I get so bored seeing the same bland, white faces in movie after movie. Same goes for men.	1
Women of color, is there anything popular TV shows or movies do to appeal to you that really annoys you?	I am loving the HBO series Insecure as F&@k. I started watching it out of boredom, but I was instantly hooked. I'm not the show's demographic (43 yr old white woman), but I love it.	I'm not a big fan of throwing the token "ethnic" person into the show who is super 2D. And worse, when they try to show either exaggerated versions of them in either direction (either they're the super stereotypical version of that ethnicity or they're the polar opposite like so unbelievably "white" it's too much). Is that what you were asking for?	0
Women mid-20s and above, what do you wish you knew entering your 20s?	I wish I'd understood the colossal amounts of change I'd experience. I'm almost 28 and I'm not *remotely* the same person I was at 20. I don't want any of the same things, a lot of my worldview has shifted, my social circle has changed drastically. I'm more confident, I have way more money, I feel like I have a direction and control over my life, and the future doesn't freak me out nearly as much. Your twenties aren't when you get "old." Your twenties are when you do a lot of growing up (which is not the same as becoming all serious and not having fun -- I have tons of fun and plan to continue). And it's been a little scary but mostly exciting so far. Also, yes, sunscreen. And try not to dig yourself into any financial holes.	Don't rush into anything: relationships, college, career, etc... play the field in all areas rather than rushing in to a commitment. Make sure any commitment you make is for YOU and not your parents, friends, society, or anyone else. Enjoy all the young people stuff while you can! A 30+ year old at a spring break bikini beach beer pong party just isn't cute. Do all those young and crazy kid things while you can (backpack through Spain, volunteer in Belize, move to the beach... you know, irresponsible stuff). Don't have regrets! And, of course, don't forget all the wise stuff: use sun screen and condoms, don't try hard drugs like meth or heroin, and start a savings account.	1
What is a bad present you've gotten?	My mother is pro at shit gifts: I'm very lactose intolerant and she got me a chocolate fountain. I did all the cooking in our house because my mother is terrible at cooking so she got me a 'Anyone can learn to cook in 24hrs' cookbook. The biggest slap in the face was probably when she got me one of those microwavable hotwater bottle things because 'you've always complained so much about your period pain'. I don't even own a microwave and I have Endometriosis, which my mother always downplayed and ignored. I'm having surgery soon because of how bad my adhesions are and my chronic pain. Fuck you, mum.	One year my grandparents inherited a bunch of money, and everyone knew. But everyone got cheap-ass sweatshirts, and after everyone opened everything, my grandpa gave my grandma a MASSIVE 3D TV, with an X Box one, and multiple games and 3D movies. -_-	1
What media that was targeted directly at you was lost on you? What did you totally fall for?	Anything where a "strong female character" is treated like a selling point - everything from Buffy to Agent Carter to Parks and Recreation. No! I want to see female characters who fail, fuck up their jobs and their relationships, create bigger problems for themselves than they can solve alone, and otherwise get to be messy and genuinely flawed, not just "flawed" in cute Hollywood ways that get overlooked and solved by the end of every episode/movie. I don't want to see women who kick ass all the time, because I don't relate to that at all. Give me woman characters whose lives are in disarray but who are allowed to be real, three-dimensional protagonists (or antiheroes) by the narrative.	The impression I've gotten from ladies I've known is that all women are supposed to love Jane Austen in general and Pride and Prejudice in particular (I've known ladies who reread it every year) and, with apologies to Jane Austen fans, I couldn't stand that book. Yes, well-written; yes, a big deal historically. But I bounced off it really hard. But (switching ages here) I was totally the target demographic for Starring Sally J Freedman As Herself, and YA book or not, I still reread that, even in my thirties. That's almost exactly the kind of kid I was.	0
Describe a time you should have listened to your "gut feeling"?	I always thought one coworker was creepy. It was the way he looked at women. It felt so slimy. I told a coworker about all the creepy vibes I got from him and totally got shrugged off. I avoided him as best as possible and fortunately did not have to interact with him much. He was fired for sexually assaulting a female coworker.	I knew it was wrong to begin with. She was married. I was married. But the allure of a beautiful, much younger woman was too strong for me. She was plain about her past from the beginning, that this wasn't the first time she had been unfaithful. I knew I should have said no right at the first. But I didn't. I fell for her and now my life - and that of my wife and her husband - is in more turmoil than I could have imagined. I wish I'd done the right thing and listened to myself. A virtuous man would not be writing these words. And yes - I know - I'm getting everything that I deserve.	1
What's the most accurate portrayal of mental illness you've seen in media?	First episode of Mr. Robot when he's crying and he says that his crying episodes have been happening weekly then says "What do normal people do when they get this sad? Turn to family and friends?" Also in that episode when he's standing outside of a bar wanting to go in because it's his friend's birthday but he can't bring himself to go inside because he's overcome with anxiety and can't get himself to socialize. Really struck a chord with me. The whole series is a very fresh and realistic depiction of anxiety and depression.	I took a girl to go see Silver Lining's Playbook in theaters. When it ended and she was crying I realized my life wasn't normal :/ So ya, SLP is accurate enough that I didn't really distinguish it too much from reality. I've been meaning to read the book.	1
What's the shittiest and most unthoughtful gift you ever received from an SO?	Today for Christmas my husband gave me spice jars and silicone rings that go under your electric stove burners to prevent gunk build up.... His explanation, "they were on your Amazon wish list." Apparently I needed to explain to him that just because it is on my Amazon list doesn't mean I want it as a gift! I thought it was a little thoughtless. He tried to defend it by reminding me he bought me a fancy Kitchen Aid mixer 4 years ago for our first Christmas together. It's a good thing I love the man.	I had a boyfriend in 9th grade tell me he had a gift for me and kept talking it up. He got me a box of condoms. I hadn't had anything close to sex with him or anyone at that point	0
Ladies, how do you deal when people ask you unwanted questions regarding your plans for the future?	Phew, lots of angry responses in this thread. I just answer. Examples: When are you having kids? I'm not sure, but definitely not anytime soon. What are you going to do after you graduate? I'll look for a job in [industry]. Then, if you want to, change the subject or ask about their life. People who ask these questions are just curious about you and your life. If you barely know the person, you can be vague, but there's no reason to be rude in response to a simple question. If the person starts judging or prying, you'll need to be more firm, but being snarky right off the bat is just unkind.	Back when my husband and I first got married, we were constantly barraged with, "So... when are you going to have kids?" Then we actually did have troubles conceiving so it got harder and harder to hear the constant questions. Finally, "Well, we would have kids if he could just figure out what hole to stick it in." Shuts 'em right up.	0
What celebrity death affected you the most?	I can't see how any fan who doesn't actually know the person in question is actually affected, apart from just being a bit sad about it when they read the headline. They certainly aren't affected like that person's friends and family whose lives actually change. That said, I still feel sad when I think of Steve Irwin. I was a bit upset as a kid when I heard he was killed, although I couldn't say I was surprised (I was only surprised by what did him in as I would have expected a crocodile or a snake.) Mostly I just feel sad when I think about what he would be doing now. I imagine he would still be involved in conservation, probably even still on TV.	David Bowie. I was a huge fan, he was one of my style icons, I just sorta took it for granted that he was part of this world and always would be. Knew he had a new album, then one morning I woke up and in my half-asleep state heard his name on the news, thought 'is he going to be on? I didn't think he was the morning news show type' but then I realized they were saying REMEMBERING and no, oh no.	0
What are you sick of seeing in guy's profiles on tinder?	"just ask" "i'm not good at writing bios" "don't swipe me if you're going to want to talk forever" & I second the annoying negativity, bitterness, dead animal photos, and the "8'2" because apparently that matters" Also apparently 50% of tinder has been to Machu Picchu	Dudes on Tinder period. I have it set to only show women, why the fuck doesn't the filter work dammit?	1
What would $100 get you in your hobby?	About a sweater's quantity of yarn, maybe a bit less. At least most of a sweater's worth of yarn though!	I'm a dude, and $100 would get me absolutely nothing since i make edm tracks on my computer. A new daw would cost around $600+	1
What do you actually do in the shower with your SO?	I REALLY enjoy being naked in the shower with my SO without it being sexual. He'll wash my hair, wash my body, give me kisses. I'll wash his body, rub his back. We usually don't have sex in the shower because the angle isn't right, but it's still incredibly Intimate! Then it usually devolves into him spewing water out of his mouth like a fountain and being grossed out by all of my hair on the side of the shower haha I love him.	We just talk and go about our normal shower routines. Sometimes he tries to touch me while I'm washing my body and it drives me nuts. I'm not a monkey or child needing help with my hygiene.	1
What is a mistake you see dads make with their daughters that you think they overlook?	Not everything has to be a life lesson. I literally got a lecture this weekend about keeping your head cool in a crisis because I had to borrow a torque screwdriver to repair my oven after it caught a greasefire from a leaky springform pan. Mind you, I dumped a bag of flour on it, put it out, and then set out to disassembling and cleaning once it cooled, but I still got a "It's important to remember where your head is at" for about two hours. I just wanted a screwdriver head that I didn't own.	One thing my dad did was he would try to make good points but frame them like jokes. Like when I was a teen (and I thought I was super cool) I tried wearing a lot of black, and he'd say "you going to a funeral?" Or I'd wear something tight and he'd tell me to "stop stealing clothes from six year olds." When I wore too much makeup on my eyes he'd ask "who punched you?" When I was being an angsty teen that of course just made me mad, but now I realize he just didn't want me dressing like such a little punk.	1
Mothers of girls, what are some things that surprised you as they were growing up?	Disclaimer: never been pregnant but speaking from the context of being the very first grandchild who happened to be a girl. My parents received a crap ton of ultra feminine frilly Sunday dresses and all my aunts old barbies and dolls, expecting me to be this ultra girly southern princess haha. Turns out I hated playing with dolls and preferred hot topic t-shirts. It was a weird pressure to deal with as a young kid but now it's just a funny story that still gets tossed around.	Mine is only two weeks old, so I'm looking forward to this thread immensely. One thing that has surprised me so far: did you know newborn girls can get tiny baby periods? I freaked out finding small amounts of blood in her diaper, but apparently the hormones from birth can get into their systems and cause a miniature period in the first few days of life.	0
Is anyone else celebrating NYE alone?	Put on a swell dress, going out to a nice dinner, then drinks and desert at a little speakeasy and cap off the night at my usual bar :)	This thread is making me feel so much better. I just moved across the country and my mom has been guilt tripping me for not having new friends in my new town. Spending NYE alone has been feeling really lonely and embarrassing.	0
To counter our brother sub's post: What is the most psycho thing a guy has ever done to you?	As a guy I can only apologise for the amount of abuse and upset other males have caused you. I'm horrified by some of the things that have been said and I hope everyone else is too.	Made me stand naked on a table in front of his friends while he pointed out every physical flaw and threatened to shave my head if I didn't stop crying. Punched me in the stomach as hard as he could at random times when we were kissing or having sex. Threw my cel phone into traffic so I couldn't call the police after he tried to strangle me outside a nightclub. While I was running to a gas station for help he chased after me screaming that he'd beat me home and kill my dog. It was only after he threatened my dog that I got strong enough to leave him. Ah, l'amour.	0
How do you spoil yourself?	For my last few birthdays I've taken the day off of work, stayed in bed reading until about noon, ordered tons of sashimi (take out, so I don't have to change out of pajamas and I barely have to talk to anyone), and played video games/watched Netflix until my husband came home to take me out to dinner.	I sit in a gorgeous local hipster cafe (there are a few to choose from) and slowly drink an iced black coffee while making lists on my phone or otherwise musing/planning about my future. The one nearest my house serves me the iced black coffee in a tall milkshake glass with a straw. I can close my eyes and pretend it's a milkshake :-/ (I decided to not drink coffee or other non-alcoholic drinks with any calories in them any more over the last month, to help me ease into a lower-sugar lifestyle. Alcoholic drinks are still fine though - wine, beer, alcoholic milkshakes even. I make the rules!) (It's a damn shame, because the aforesaid cafe makes an excellent donut-&-espresso milkshake with extra donut on top. I had it once before I made the Rule, it was so good.)	1
What's the most motivating thing anybody's ever said to you?	"coals are key." was in reference to learning how to start a fire from my dad when i was 11, but as i've grown older, i've applied it to other things, using less literally and more metaphorically. coals are key to a good fire, just as motivation/inspiration/etc are key to reaching your goals.	My brother always told me this one when we went running together, but it applies to a lot of things I've found: "When you get tired, you're exhausted and you want to stop, that is your limit. That's where you are now. Every step you take after that is improvement."	0
Women who are conventionally attractive: Do you have any stories where your attractiveness has actually been a disadvantage in your career (or your life) ?	No one takes me seriously. They assume that I'm stupid and even when I prove that I'm not, there's still that feeling. It's even been implied that I'd do best as a trophy wife by a manager before.	This question alone demonstrates a disadvantage for attractive women. The use of the word "actually" makes it sound like you don't even believe an attractive woman can be disadvantaged, which in and of itself is a disadvantage to an attractive women. I am constantly treated this way. "There's no way she's not a bitch, there's no way she doesn't get everything she wants, there's no way blah blah blah". Just because I am conventionally attractive. I once had a coworker say: "I wanted to hate you because you're so pretty, but you're just so nice." Thanks.	1
Women who had their first relationship at 25+ years old what was it like?	My sister got her first boyfriend at 26, she's 28 now. She didn't choose singleness before that. She and her boyfriend are fully attached now, they can't be without texting each other a whole hour. They have a horrible relationship, one is controlling and the other has lost their personality for that. Things you don't know how to do because it's your first and you have no idea what relationships should be like.	First boyfriend at 23, he was one year younger than me, with him two years, it was nice but he was immature and it didn't last obviously. I often wonder if, had I had boyfriends earlier, in university say, would I have had more experience to be able to avoid the absolute arseholes I've been involved with in my later 20s since the first boyfriend?? I guess there's no point looking back and wondering because the past is gone.	1
Can you tell us about the most inappropriate time or place you were hit on (or the most inappropriate person to have hit on you)?	My first SO had just died. A week later, his best friend asked if I was over him and would go on a date. What the hell, dude?	I was 14 he was my neighbors 24 year old best friend. I was walking down the street with a friend and he yelled from across the street "HEY, WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET YOU OUT OF THAT SKIRT". I awkwardly walked faster. I saw him on and off for the next 21 years and last October I married him. So guess it works sometimes. :P Edit: word	1
My cat likes to steal my make up brushes and play with them. What does your cat do that pisses you off?	She yowls all night long. If she can get into the bathtub, that's her favorite spot to do it because of the acoustics. It's like she's trying out for American Idol.	My cat morphed into a dog so I'm totally happy now! He doesn't do anything wrong 98% of the time.	1
What love story, whether real or fictional, seemed romantic to you at one time but now just seems creepy and/or wrong?	I don't personally agree with this, but a lot of people are outraged about what they consider the rapey nature of the premise for "Passengers". Personally, I liked it and thought it was a solid love story...in the end.	Pretty much every romantic plot line in every teen drama, ever. Kids, you're 15/16 years old. This insane co-dependant lunacy you have going on is good for neither of you. I know it seems, like, SO ROMANTIC but it's not. It's usually kind of obsessive/creepy/manipulative/straight up abusive.	0
What male character in all fiction is just the WORST?	Victor Frankenstein. He's just so self-absorbed, affected, arrogant, completely lacking in empathy, entitled, and whiny. Everything that goes badly in the book doesn't go badly because of his creation, but because of his giant jackass personality. I really enjoyed the novel, but it was one of the only books I've really struggled to finish solely because of the awful personality of the main character.	So most of the people so far are talking about straight up villains, but when I saw the question, all I could think was HARRY POTTER. He was just so whiny and made super stupid decisions all the time. I get that he was a kid, but he never learned from any of his mistakes ever and people died because of it (SIRIUS BLACK: NEVER FORGET).	1
Alright, I've gotta ask my fellow Reddit ladies: Do you sleep with socks on or without socks on?	Without. I sleep nude (or in just underwear when I'm on my period). I would hate sleeping in socks. My toes just need their freedom, I guess.	I can't sleep without socks on, I'm a weirdo. I don't like my skin touching when I sleep for some reason so I'm always in socks and leggings.	1
Women who have dated guys you knew were great for you but you didn't feel that romantically attracted to them, how did dating them turn out for you?	I'm currently in this situation. Dammit, he's a great guy. He's smart and handsome and well travelled and likes all the same things I do...and I've just got nothing, no excitement to see him, no attraction. We've only been seeing each other for about a month and I keep hoping I'll suddenly get butterflies for him. Reading this thread is making me think I should just break it off now. Drat. :(	OP, in the future please make sure that your question is inclusive of all genders and sexualities as we do not allow posts that limit responses to those from majority demographics. Everyone else, please feel free to respond based on the gender of partners you prefer.	1
What do you wish you knew before living on-campus in college?	If you live in a co-ed dorm, you have to be just as worried about getting groped, flashed, etc as you do on the street. Carry something that can be used as a weapon as real weapons, including pepper spray, aren't allowed. Flashlights, umbrellas, and textbooks can work in a pinch.	This sounds bad, but if you share a room, do not be overly accommodating when working out your roommate agreement. If you know you'll feel uncomfortable with others sleeping in the room, let it be known. Anything like that, don't try too hard to be cool. Also, talk about problems as soon as they arise, rather than waiting until it's a huge issue. If you like peace, considering living in the quiet dorm. Of course, you can always go out to parties, but quiet dorms tend to be chill and focused on studies. Going to college is a huge adjustment. Living away from home is a huge adjustment. Many people struggle. Don't be afraid to reach out for help, whether it's your family, on campus services, or friends.	0
Hey ladies, who is going to the Women's March on Washington and where are you coming from?	I won't be in DC, but I'll be going to my local march in support of you guys, and yes, there are marches happening in Canada too.	I am sure I will be downvoted but....No. This march doesn't represent me or what I am feeling after the election. I also feel the amount of fundraising that could be accomplished with the same vigor could go toward meaningful changes.	1
How did you unwittingly embarrass your parents or family when you were a kid?	When I was a kid, I was really into this movie called Banjo the Woodpile Cat. There was a scene in which Banjo's father instructed him to find a "switch." I had to ask my dad what it meant, and he explained it was a stick for spanking. I thought this was HILARIOUS for some reason, and I always wanted my dad to pretend to spank me and I would just giggle. My family also would playfully tickle each other, because my mom and I are both very ticklish. One day (according to my parents-I don't remember this) we were in a park with other families and kids and my parents were talking to other grownups, and I found a good switch and started yelling "SPANK ME, DADDY! TICKLE ME AND SPANK ME!" Allegedly, my parents were absolutely mortified. Good times.	When I was 5, my dad took me to a small cheese shop that was run by Mennonites (Ontario Amish sort of). All the ladies working there wore old fashioned dresses, little white linen head coverings, the whole deal. So we walk in, and they have every kind of cheese known to humanity in huge fridges along every wall. I was impressed. The first thing out of my mouth (in front of all these religious ladies) was, "OH, CHEESES!" My dad was embarrassed.	1
What are some "green flags" to look out for when dating?	ITT: girls you set the bar very low. 99% of the stuff in this thread is just basic human decency and sanity.	* Integrity. They do what they say they're going to do. * Compatible libido level and/or compatible kinks. * Communicaton skills. * Emotional maturity. How do they act during a disagreement? Do they call me names? Do they walk off down the street without saying anything? Can they discuss matters calmly and try to see both sides? * Financial savvy. I didn't expect anyone to be rich, but I did desire to find someone else who lived within their means, didn't spend money they didn't have, etc.	0
What are your unpopular opinions about food?	I don't like warm, or even room temperature fruit. I like my fruit to be cold, especially if you bite into it and there's a juice.	Not quite an answer to your question because I kind of like everything. I'm actually having trouble thinking of a food I don't like or will at least eat. However, a lot of my friends are vegetarians. Like the kind that constantly post videos of animals being slaughtered on Facebook along with sad sounding music and commentaries on how inhuman it makes me to eat meat. I still like my fois gras. They can all shove it.	1
(X-post from AskMen) What are some basic things that people can upgrade in their life that they might not have thought of?	* comfy pillows * A long phone charger * Kitchen equipment (A good quality knife and some good quality pans can change your world) * Some spices/seasonings. My boyfriend bought us a little herb rack that came with 18 or so little bottles or different herbs/seasonings/spices. Changed our cooking completely. * A really nice mug * A good quality umbrella * Comfy, good quality shoes. * A coat that keeps you warm and dry * Wireless headphones * A dehumidifier. We have a mini one that you can put oils in. Makes the house smell incredible. * Nice underwear. * A well fitting bra. (If you haven't gotten fitted in a while please go and get fitted) * Toilet paper * A bus pass	a high quality chef's knife will making cooking a lot less stressful than the cheap block set someone gave you when you got your first apartment.	0
Women who had non-traditional weddings: how much pushback did you get from friends and family? What was the worst?	My aunt got married by someone who was ordained on the Internet. With my father, a qualified and educated minister licensed to officiate weddings in all 50 states, sitting in the audience. He took it as a huge slap in the face not just to him but to his profession too.	My husband I eloped with our best friends at a castle. We already had a kid, a house, the whole 9, and didn't want to shell out for a huge wedding (his side is basically My Big Fat Greek Wedding so his guest list would start at 120, just "immediate family"). And we wanted were some nice pics, you know? His side was annoyed..."why didn't you do it at the church?" "What about having a reception?" Can't you get remarried at Fancy Country Club?"...and we'd say back, "Sure Aunt Bertha! Thanks for offering to pay!" They shut them up fast lol. But after a few weeks it all calmed down and no one cares about it. Except my MiL, but she's a monster.	0
To those who sleep separately from your spouse/partner: why &amp; where do you sleep instead?	Other bedroom. He's a heat generator and I have hot flashes. Opposite schedules. Special needs pets, need to be in the same room. I am a terrible sleeper who doesn't work outside the home so I'm the one who finds it easiest to keep the erratic hours.	We sleep in our own separate beds, in separate houses, because neither of us have a job or a car yet and we live 10 miles apart at the moment.	1
What are some common complaints from men that you don't/can't actually believe are real things?	I think it's funny that one of the main complaints on AW is when men invalidate women. Which indeed is lame. And then threads like this are popular where half of the responses are just invalidating the experiences of men.	Too many men don't understand female genitals and how the vagina keeps itself clean. As soon as they make a comment about"everything being clean down there" I assume they don't know what clean in that regard actually means. It's a fleshy hole with a distinct balance of good bacteria, bad bacteria, pH etc... Don't expect soap and sparkles. You can tell when things are wrong okay - but a lot of men don't know what healthy is.	0
What's the latest movie that made you go "holy shit!"?	I started reading this post because I wanted to collect some new movies to watch... Not new movies and spoilers on recently released movies. Thanks.	Just got done watching The Prestige a little while ago. That movie is a devastating mind fuck (in the best way possible). YOU DON'T KNOW?!	0
Would you ever consider adopting a child? Why? Why not?	Nope- you don't know what genetic issues and aggressions you're up against. Plus the only reason to have a kid is because my and my fiancée genes are so good that it would be cruel not to	I've been thinking more and more about it lately. I do want children but I just ... I can't easily explain it but I feel so weird about having another body inside my body. I don't think I can deal with the physical changes of pregnancy. To me it doesn't feel magical. I don't want my whole shit to change. I'm really private and get skin creepy-crawlies when someone touches my stomach. I don't think pregnancy would work for me. But I love kids. And I'd love to adopt. It's expensive and difficult though my company covers adoption costs.	0
Women who married for reasons other than love, why did you marry and how is it working out?	Kind of answering your question. I married for love but some "friends" think I married to "win" at sibling rivalry, even though my brother and I are really close. (I married my brothers best friend) my brother was best man at our wedding and is really happy for us.	My aunt told me once that the only reason she married my uncle was to try and escape the turmoil that her family got thrown into when her father died. She was 20 and had been dating him (my uncle) for a few months. They've been married almost 50 years now. I'm not sure they really love each other anymore, but are just used to each other. Despite what my aunt likes to say. They bicker and argue all the the time, kinda treat each other like crap in a very passive aggressive way.	0
To women who are physically active, how many times a week do you workout and what activities/sports do you do?	I don't have workouts. I just live actively. I don't own a car. I walk and bike everywhere I go. Typically between 5-10 miles a day, sometimes twice that on weekends.	Currently: Monday: 1 hour belly dancing Tuesday: 1 hour stretching, 2 hours bodyweight strength training Wednesday: 1 hour parkour, 1 hour tumbling Thursday: 1 hour tumbling, 2 hours bodyweight strength training Friday: 1 hour parkour Saturday: 2 hours parkour Sunday: 1 hour aerial yoga, 1 hour stretching, 1.5 hours aerial arts (silks/lyra/trapeze) -------------------------------- starting in february: I'll be replacing all the parkour and tumbling with aerial classes. I also go downhill skiing on a semi regular basis. *Disclaimer: I am a man*	1
What is your petty workplace feud about, a who is it with?	So, one shift my partner and I got slammed with back to back calls and didn't have time to put any gas in the ambulance at the end of the day. Ok, kind of a jerk move, but it still had at least half a tank. It happens. WELL. The incoming crew was pissed off to an unreasonable level. Every time I'm their relief crew, they intentionally do not fill the ambulance, and will sometimes even leave it completely trashed for me to deal with when I clock in, and will gleefully tell me to go get gas on their way out the door. GUYS IT WAS ONE TIME! WHY MUST WE CONTINUE LIKE THIS?	Presently it's about a lunch treat, an invite was sent to everyone in the office, except my small department. When a friend from another department asked the person why, they said they forgot thought they got everyone on the email. So then forwarded the email to my department without so much as an "oops" or "sorry" but a lame comment on extra dessert for us or something. Safe to say, skipping the lunch. And cold shoulder to the treating team.	1
What fashion faux-pas do you make a POINT to break?	Pyjamas out of the house. I can't be arsed with proper trousers or jeans anymore, especially when it's a Sunday morning and I'm just out to the shops to get some milk. PJ bottoms or leggings are all I wanna be in.	Wearing oversized sweaters despite having a larger-than-average rack. I don't care if I look like a pregnant potato from the side, I'm comfortable as hell.	0
Women who regularly go braless, how do people treat you?	From a dude's perspective, I doubt I'd even notice. Unless you're wearing something sheer, or your bust size lends itself to obvious movement, I dont generally find myself all that curious about what sort of undergarments you may or may not be wearing. On an unrelated note, are you a spider?	No one really cares but I am very small up there. Some guys do think it's "hot", and a couple people have asked me why I went bra less but it never has been a big deal. You should wear a bra tho for job interviews. I had an employer look straight at my nipples once.	0
What's the most disappointing sexual experience you've ever had?	Met this guy in a club about 5 years back. Went up to his hotel room and started getting into it. He was fucking me from behind and was holding my head into the pillow. I turn my head to look back at him and he was recording it on his cell phone. No warning and never asked me if he could do that. Naturally, I freaked the fuck out and grabbed his phone and went through the pictures/videos and deleted everything as well as my number.	I was in a student house and was about to have sex with this guy I really liked and it wouldn't go in and then someone knocked on the door...	1
Where is the worst place you've ever had to pee?	It was in some horrible hotel in Russia. An orange looking fat businessman asked me to. He had very small hands.	A porta-potty at a festival. Someone had food poisoning or something. There was vomit and liquid feces all over, and sticky urine on the floor. The heat index was in the triple digits and the humidity was... enough to make you sticky in places you didn't know existed. And it was in a crowded place in the middle of the day, so I couldn't just duck into an alley or crouch behind a dumpster.	0
Women of reddit, what is your worst beauty induced injury?	I was trimming my pubes with a pair of scissors and accidentally cut my labia. That hurt like SON-OF-A-[non-AW word].	I've got arthritis in both feet at a pretty young age thanks to wearing cute shoes that were wrong for me, if that counts.	0
Women with aspergers/autism traits, how did you know you were different and how long did it take you to be diagnosed?	I watched Rainman when it first came out (late 80's) and asked my mother if maybe there was a milder version of that that I had. Autism was brand new to most of the world at that stage so she told me not to be silly. A few years later when I was in my 20's, Aspergers became a thing and the penny dropped. I've never been officially diagnosed because I was long out of the school system by then and there was no need. My son has been though, and he's just like me at that age.	Its interesting to because generally as adults, men are the ones who often get associated with autism.....womem are often underreported or they just socialize in a way where being autistic isnt pronounced aand easily identifiable. Ive always womdered but never bothered to check why men seem to be the face of it more so than women When u think about it, if a guy is socially awkward, its often seen as bizarre and weird..whereas women are seen more along the line of "cute" for similar behavior.	1
Has there ever been a time when you weren't taken seriously for a medical complaint, and it turned out to be something serious? What happened and how do you feel about it?	When I was a young teen I started feeling sick and nauseous all the time. Like really really bad. Doctors said I was just nervous about school or something, cos teen girls are highly strung right? The nausea got so bad that I stopped eating, because I couldn't eat without feeling sick. Doctors decided that I was anorexic. Eventually I lost so much weight they put me in a psych hospital and started treatment for anorexia. Basically, I had to eat lots and lots, and have therapy about my body image and calories and stuff. It didn't help, obviously. Just last year, at 23, nearly ten years later, I was diagnosed with gastroparesis, which is where my stomach actually doesn't work properly and makes me feel nauseous all the time. I wasn't making it up after all.	Only my entire life. I have a genetic condition that has been showing symptoms since I was a toddler and I got a partial diagnosis and treatment for it not long after my 38th birthday. I'm still waiting for the genetic testing that will give me specifics, but at least I know it's not MS or Parkinsons or some other degenerative neurological disease.	1
How old were you when you first felt sexualised? How did that make you feel and how did you deal with it?	I'm 17 and I honestly think I've never been sexualized except when it was mutual and just like teenagers flirting. So um idk?	When I was 11 I was over at my friends house for the night. She took me into her room and said her dad "thought I was sexy and wanted to hook up" He then came in and said he'd love to touch me if I'd let him and that I really turned him on. I was mortified and told him no and reminded him that my dad was a cop.	0
What celebrity has disappointed you?	I remember being disappointed with Britney Spears, but in the years since her meltdown I've come to be more empathetic when I see that sort of thing with other celebs.	Taylor Motherfucking Swift. Girl. I love you. But not going to the March? Not even your local one? Also, consorting with Lena Dunham? This is privileged white feminism at its finest.	1
What are the worst lingering habits/insecurities that were instilled in you as a kid and have followed you into adulthood?	If it feels good, I shouldn't be doing it. Unless it's work. Then if the work feels bad it's because I'm lazy.	My mom would call my name for the dumbest shit and then yell at me if I didn't respond immediately. Now every time someone calls my name or says "look" or something like that, I respond automatically. I feel like a trained dog.	0
Married women, if your partner was discrete and completely safe, would you allow them to sleep with other people? How do you feel about open marriages?	Absolutely 150% no. I'm monagamous through and through, so if my SO either cheated or asked if he could, it would be over. I said this before in another post maybe like a week ago: what is the point in having a relationship of any kind with someone if you're not going to want to only be with them? Just stay single if that's where your head's at.	Here are the percents for what women have said so far: No= 68% Yes/have done it= 21% Maybe= 4% Unclear answer= 7% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edit: 3 hours later: No= 63% Yes= 26% Maybe= 5% Unclear answer= 6%	0
Women of reddit who work out, what changes have you noticed that you didn't expect?	This past month I've gone to the gym 6 days a week. I feel more relaxed most of the day, but also more tired at night. I usually run 3 miles every time I go, just because I like to run. I've lost a significant amount of body fat; my face looks better shaped, and my body looks thin, fit, and more proportionate. Only downside I've noticed is: my butt shrank a small bit. If you're trying to loose extra fat/pounds I recommend running 3 miles almost every day at around 8-10 mph	I have a butt now. I mean, I did expect to eventually have a nicer looking one, but I guess it's not just my thigh muscles that build up really fast. It happened a lot faster than I was anticipating.	0
What tiny, stupid life struggle do you sometimes face?	When I'm trying to put a jacket on and I realise that the 2nd arm is inside out, so I spend the next minute or so jabbing at it trying to stick my arm through the sleeve without having to take the jacket off to fix it.	I am left-handed and the Metrocard readers in the NYC subway are right-handed. I frequently spend a stupid amount of time trying to 1. awkwardly use my left hand to swipe my Metrocard or 2. repeatedly use my right hand to swipe my Metrocard at an incorrect speed, getting the "please swipe card at this turnstile" message and becoming increasingly flustered by the irritated commuters behind me.	1
What's the most outrageous question you've ever been asked due to your gender?	My boyfriend and I were out to dinner with another couple. Boyfriend and I split our bill evenly. Female friend says: "why are you splitting it? He makes more than you, he should pay for everything".	"Gosh, you're in your late 20s already...Don't you worry about getting older? Women don't age as well as men." This from a guy who smoked a pack a day, tanned to the point of leather-y skin, and took no care of his body at all. Fuck. Right. Off.	0
What do you firmly believe now that you did not when you were younger?	Money, attractiveness, confidence, and networking are important to getting ahead in life. I grew up poor and thought that simply being smart and working hard was good enough. Then I went to an elite college where I still didn't care about my appearance or socializing. Now that I put more care into my appearance and make conscious social decisions, people seem to respect me and like me more. Of course working hard and being intelligent matter a lot. But combined with good social etiquette and a little makeup, you can make a better impression on the people you want to develop relationships with.	You're not a true adult until you are at least 25. Science tells the same but I didn't really care in my early 20s. Now looking back at 31, turns out they were right.	1
What female character tropes/cliches irritate you the most?	All women shoot bows in fantasy settings. Sorry, but shooting bows requires some heavy lifting strength, no way a 15 year old rebel girl would be able to use that effectively.	The "I'm not like other girls because I was raised by 73 brothers, I'm incredible hot and ridiculously smart, also I'm single!"	0
Sexual assault survivors: how open have you been with friends, family, etc. about your experience? How receptive have people been and do you regret either speaking or not speaking up?	I've never told my family about it, but two of my friends know. If I'm on a social media platform where I can be mostly anonymous, I talk about it. I don't regret telling my friends and I don't regret keeping it from my family. It's been years at this point anyway so bringing it up to them now would serve no purpose other than to hurt them.	I'm public about it on Reddit, but I don't mention it anywhere else, and I barely bring it up in therapy. I never reported, and I didn't because I don't hate myself that much, and I didn't need any additional trauma to get to the same results. I don't feel bad about not letting my family know. Some things you just gotta take to the grave. Unless I see one of them in public, because then I'll be taking the both of us to the grave.	0
what common relationship advice irritates you the most ?	When I first found out about a thing called "love languages". It seems like a parody that people seem to take very seriously.	"Just talk it out." Well yea, but can I be left the fuck alone for a bit though because talking it out right now when my anger level is 10 probably isn't productive so leeeeeeeave me alone we don't need to talk immediately.	0
What changes moved you from living paycheck to paycheck to being financially comfortable?	Shopping smarter - make a menu, make a shopping list and stick to it. We buy meat directly from a local processor. It's much cheaper, the meat is better, fresher, and not pumped full of steroids, antibiotics and God knows what. No credit cards. But whatif....NO CREDIT CARDS!	Getting divorced and no longer having to support my husband. I know it sounds flip, but it's true - spouses are hella expensive!	0
how important is food compatibility to you when it comes to relationships ?	Very. I eat a lot of foods, and expect the same. I am not vegan, and have a hard time accommodating that (my BFF is vegan, and we go out to like, one place) although vegetarian I can usually handle. I also like to travel, and if one is not willing to eat local and order off a menu one cannot read, gtfo.	I'm a vegetarian and my SO isn't, but he doesn't mind eating vegetarian meals sometimes and I don't mind handling/cooking meat. When we go out for, say, Thai food, he prefers curries and I like noodles, but we're both willing to eat the same types of cuisines/neither of us is picky, so it's fine. And I love cooking so it's okay with me that he isn't a big fan. One thing that is important to me is enjoying food—I like to go to restaurants as a fun thing to do, I like to try new foods, I like to cook elaborate meals, etc. Someone who only ate for sustenance wouldn't be compatible.	0
Women who work in computer science/IT, what's the most infuriating case of being professionally undervalued by coworkers for being a woman?	When other women assume I need "women in tech" groups and that I need them to help "advance" me. The men I have worked with have been nothing but respectful and have treated me no differently than they've treated each other. If anything they assume I'm smarter than I am. But when people--often women--assume I need all these programs and special help that men don't have in order to have a successful career, I find it insulting.	I've never dealt with it from coworkers, but clients on the other hand.. If I can't fix it right away it's because of my gender, if a guy can't it must be really broken. And just lots of variations of that.	0
What is the the #1 thing that most guys don't realize about women?	It takes a lot to make all of "this" happen every day. Leg shaving, moisturizing, makeup, outfit, hair, etc. Most girls can't roll out of bed and look the way they would need to to feel comfortable going out. Take a minute to tell a girl she looks nice today. If you notice a friend/coworker/your girlfriend changed something about her appearance and you think it looks nice, tell her.	The #1 thing in my life is that not all women are the same. Just because a woman acts the same in the slightest as another woman some men who I have spoken instantly classify as a type they've dealt with before. That is untrue. Woman are the same, alike and different in various ways. It's like classifying a disorder; you have to have a certain amount of the Specific symptoms and degrees of it in order to classify Someone.	0
What do you do EVERY Sunday to help prepare you for the week ahead?	Absolutely nothing and i let my mind wonder to its full extent. Your mind is a sentient being and forcing it to crouch numbers and do other tasks or whatever you do leaves it without its own intellectual needs. I don't need it to remember anything or stress about anything and do what i generally want without outside influences.	Sunday is my relaxation day. I do the chores and other stuff on other days. Sunday I just bake, read a book, watch some fun stuff, maybe use a face mask, don't watch/read the news.	0
What is your "The one that got away" doing nowadays?	He's single, has an amazing job and bought his dream car. He's living the life we planned, just without me. I sometimes wonder what life would be like if we stayed together.	He didn't in the end. We both weren't ready for a relationship the first time around. We've been together 8.5 years and are expecting our first child.	1
Have you had any "Holy shit, what am I doing with my life!?" moments recently, and what are they?	Yep. I graduated college in 2009 with a degree in sociology with the aim of doing something in criminal justice or law enforcement. I couldn't get hired in those fields, so I just took a well-paying job in IT. I'm still in IT, and a year or two ago I got super frustrated I'm still not even in the field I wanted. I applied to the FBI--got to an interview, then rejected. Was all set to join the Navy Reserve as an intelligence specialist--got discharged for a minor surgery I had to have done while waiting to ship out. Now it's mostly, "what am I doing with my life?"	I dated so many assholes in my life lately and now I decided to stick to stop lowering my standards. Sure I may be young but dating ain't easy this time around.	1
Women with mental health issues, what was the moment when you decided to seek treatment/help?	When I was fed up with being completely miserable all the time. I'd probably been depressed for about 15 years by that point.	The actual catalyst to make me get a therapist was that I spent an entire weekend awake because the dogs next door barked all night long and I couldn't focus on anything but the fact that the dogs were barking. I realized that's not normal. However I also had enough of worrying about everything, being scared of everything, being tired all the time, feeling so lonely, of my world being so small, and I couldn't live like that anymore. The catalyst for going on meds came a few months later when I had a public meltdown in a salon. I was physically unable to stop crying and shaking and realized that the anxiety was out of my control. I wish i had done this years and years ago. It's hard to carry and unpack all the emotional baggage and it takes longer the more you carry.	0
Mothers of AskWomen, what are some of the "mom things" that you thought you would never do but ended up doing it anyway?	Crying. I never understood why my mother always cried when me and my sisters were accomplishing stuff at school or during sport events. Especially if we had a show at school and had a solo. She's so emotional and would always feel proud. + during weddings and other "emotional" events - she would be the one sobbing. Now I cry all the time. Thanks mom.	I would never be "that mom" and force others to watch video after video or look at photo after photo of my kid, especially when people CLEARLY don't care. But now... "Hey do you have time to watch this super cute video?" "Oh, I'm actually running out to do a thing right now..." "Oh ok then I'll only show you these two short ones!"	1
Women of reddit what are some of the little things you enjoy doing for your significant other?	Head scratches, he's like a cat. Sending sexy pics cause he's obsessed with my boobs. Making his bed in the morning after I've slept at his place. Buying snacks/beer. There's not many things like this yet cause it's a very new relationship.	I pick up small gifts that he's been wanting for a long time but would never buy himself, like show tickets or a durable jacket. The only problem is I'm terrible at keeping secrets, so it's days of pure mental torture until I can finally reveal the surprise. :)	0
Internet friends, what "uncomfortable realities" in your life have you become resigned to?	I will never have a normal relationship with my mother. I'm 25 and still afraid of "getting in trouble". I don't know how it keeps happening- I'll think I've figured it out and then she pulls me back in. Logically I know I'm an adult, and that her opinion no longer matters, but in the back of my mind all I want is for her to be happy with my life. I don't even care if I'm happy with it. As long as everyone else is satisfied, I feel like I'd feel okay. But I'm so constantly afraid of hurting or upsetting the people I love that it kills me when I mess up (which I always do) and I'm constantly terrified I'll wake up and have nobody left.	I'll never earn a livable income. I only have a GED and while I like my factory job, costs of living are going to increase faster than my pay. I could never in a million years afford to be on my own (thankfully I live with my boyfriend and we share bills), I'll never afford a house or anything. My nicest possession is my car, and even that I had to finance for 6 years. I really couldn't care less about college and I don't care to have a ~real job~ in an office or something, I just want to make enough money to live. But I don't and I never will.	1
How do you decide what to make for dinner, and why don't you just eat a bowl of cereal?	Cereal is a bowl of empty carbs that spikes your blood sugar, then leaves you feeling hungry again a few hours later. I keep a binder of copies of recipes I've tried and liked. I scrawl notes on them. When I don't know what to make, I flip through and pick something based on what I have in stock plus how much effort I feel like putting in. Every so often I try a new recipe to potentially add to the binder.	I don't eat cereal. If I do, I purge it. So, I don't eat it. I usually just snack. I hate cooking.	1
How did falling in love feel different the second time around? Was it more intense, less giddy, etc? Do you think it had to do with the difference in SO or because of a change within yourself?	The second time I fell in love I realized what love really was. Someone that respected me, cared for me at my worst, at my best, and was my best friend as well as my partner. It was like a breath of fresh air, like being born all over again. The honey moon phase has seemed to never end for me I just fall in love more and more every day. Or course we have our ups and downs as couples do, but things always set themselves on the right course again. I only find them more handsome every day, more loving, etc. I'm very fortunate. Celebrating 6 years in March...not married yet though!	Falling in love all felt the same until I met the person I would spend my life with. Then, it felt different. It felt consequential. It will always feel giddy and exciting and full of promise, but when I met my husband, it felt like I came home. It's not what you asked, but I hope it helps.	0
Women of Reddit when is still living at home a red flag?	Taking care of ill family is about the only reason I'm OK with it. If you want to save, get a few roommates, don't leach off your parents. I'm very independent and have a lower threshold for this than just about anyone I know. I find people who live at home after high school truly pathetic.	Context. It's more important to me that you're *capable* of living on your own. Life skills, as you called it.	0
What's the worst thing an ex-partner has said about having sex with you?	This happened while I was still seeing him: a couple of months after we lost our virginity to each other, my ex told me that I needed to lose a lot of weight because he "deserved to have sex with a woman who had a great body".	Guy here. I just wanted to say, you ladies shouldn't let a moron's words/insults or whatever get to you. you'll find someone much better that deserves you and anything you have to offer. sincerely, every non horrible guy	1
What would misconceptions about female sexuality would you want to clear up for a teen girl?	You can totally catch cold sores in your vagina from his face cold sores. 85% of the population has some form of herpes. You can catch herpes even if they don't have an active cold sore. Use protection, even if they say it doesn't "feel as good" without it. Don't have sex just because all your friends are doing it. They're lying, they're all virgins too.	Wanting sex is normal, as is not wanting it and preferring to wait. Your value as a human being is not dependent on whether or not you're a virgin.	0
Women who have been bridesmaids, what was your favorite bridesmaid gift you have received?	The last wedding I was in I was gifted a silky robe. I love it and still wear it around the house. Another bride gave me a wine glass with my initial painted on it. I don't use it because I don't want to mess the paint up, but I thought it was a pretty decoration for the house. Edited to add: At my wedding my husband made wine that we gave away to our bridal party. Everyone LOVED it and still talks about it almost 4 years later.	Bridesmaid GIFT?...I had to buy my own ugly dress, and was then forced to pay for a second night's stay in a hotel room for...REASONS? Oh yeah, and then there was the part about being kicked out of the rehearsal dinner for reasons I was not told directly, but having pretty much to do with Bridezilla's dysfunctional, drama-prone family. You get gifts if you're a bridesmaid? Hell, I was all of the bridesmaids and the maid of honor at the same time, and it was still an "honor" I wish I'd had nothing to do with. Cool for those of you who had a good experience with it, though! I just had no idea weddings could be anything more than a nightmare.	1
What is weirdest or creepiest phone call you ever received?	I was babysitting for a friend and their house was a bit remote. Usually a friend of mine and I would babysit together as he was the one that introduced me to this friend. This time I was alone. I got a phone call where all I could hear was the tv I the living room. The living room of the house I was in. I have never been so freaked out. I never babysat at their place alone again.	I got one from an unknown number describing everything I was doing at the time. I'd like to think it was one of my friends messing with me, but I didn't recognize the voice, and no one fessed up.	0
You're the main character of the last film you watched--Can you tell me about your story without revealing the movie title?	I grew up on a small farm, and became the first of my kind to be police in the big city. I had to really fight to get respect, and I made some silly rookie mistakes that were blown out of proportion which lead to me quitting the force and going back home, which made my parents happy. I ended up going back to work the case with a petty criminal friend of mine and ended up unwinding the racist conspiracy and became an integral member of the force.	i'm a studious girl who doesn't know how to lighten up, and my boyfriend left me for a beauty pageant winner. now i have to show him and everyone that i can actually be just as good as those types of girls, and i'll stop at nothing to show them all.	1
Pet owners in relationships: who do you greet first, your pet or your SO?	If you have a dog, you don't have a choice in the matter. They make sure to get to you first.	Depends who greets me at the door first. Usually it's Luna the cat, because the sound of my car horn usually means I come inside and feed her, but the SO has been there a few times too.	1
Did you get married with no bridesmaids? How was it?	Wedding photographer here. Ive got two or three weddings this year with no bridal party, just the bride and groom. It seems to be a growing trend the last few years and naturally I'm okay with it because it's less work for me and puts more emphasis on the actual couple getting married. If you have none and your SO has two then that will definitely look different for sure.	I had two bridesmaids but they both sucked. Never went dress shopping with me. Never offered support. Never helped me get ready. Never fulfilled their duties except for showing up. In retrospect, I should have gone without them!	1
What's the most cringe inducing thing you've done after a breakup?	I freaking called his mom asking what I did wrong and if she could convince him to get back together with me... Oh God why did I do that.	My EX broke up with me the day before Valentines Day, I made him meet up with me the next day so I could still give him the gift I had gotten for him (a commissioned illustration of us) and it was just terribly awkward and he even gave me a pity gift (he had clearly already decided he was gunna dump me, so he grabbed some old, ugly, musty scarf his cousin had knit once upon a time and gave it to me as his "gift"). It was just embarrassing for both of us. I should have just burned everything and went on with my life but I was desperate for a second chance. Thankfully I got over him fairly quick after that.	1
How do you feel about your SO's porn watching and how do you deal with it?	O my ex watched it alot. He worked 2nd shift and would drink every day/night and watch it, beat it then get in bed with me. Came to the point was interfering with our sex life. We even watched together and had sex on cam. I was showing off his price Albert. Guess I wasn't good enough. O well I told him hit the road with his Hep C self. I've been tested im clear	There's not a right way to feel about it. It's normal to be fine with it, and it's normal to not be. I think it's a good idea to know why you feel how you do and be willing to discuss it. But I feel like, maybe especially on Reddit, there's this overall attitude that it's something you have to embrace, or at the very least ignore, or else you're definitely insecure/controlling/whatever - and that's just not the case. If it doesn't bother you, that's fine. But if it does, it's not wrong or weird to feel that way.	0
What is the most unintentionally offensive thing you've had happen on a first date?	Guy went on a rant against interracial marriage, I was like "um you know I'm not 100% white, right?" and he backpedaled like "I don't think your parents are bad people, I just think they're mentally ill." edit - wrong your	Generally jokes about vegetarians/vegans, or lots of talk about hunting/fishing/farming etc. in a positive way. The jokes are much more offensive, ime.	1
Who here is a big fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender/Avatar: Legend of Korra? Who is your favorite character? What's your favorite thing about the franchise?	Toph is my favorite character. My favorite thing about the franchise is having multiple female characters of different personalities and therefore avoiding the dreaded Smurfette Principle which is one female character is expected to represent all girls/women.	I loved Korra as a series, but Avatar is very special to me because I grew up with it and it sort of shaped me as a person. (I want a water tribe tattoo one day...) My favorite characters hands down are Zuko for his character development, and Toph because she's strong and doesn't need anyone. Edited because of words, whoops.	1
What is a cause that you feel passionately about and why?	I feel very passionate about changing the perception of the general population on people with mental illness. I have experienced intense and crushing depression. I wrote my masters thesis on how books and stories of people with mental illness can lessen the stigma that society imposes on people with mental illnesses. The stigma people with anxiety and depression suffer from is so severe and acts as one of the largest barriers to care because people are so fearful of how others will view them. People still think it is about bucking up and getting over it. Or they think people with a mental illness are harmful/destructive. We are all people. And we all deserve empathy and understanding.	Restoring freedom to America. If I'm not hurting anyone or stealing from anyone, leave me the fuck alone. Go get gay married while your friends have a 21 gun salute with their machine guns and then you smoke all the herbs and Cuban cigars you can find and eat fresh killed venison and caught trout. I.Don't.Care. Personally, I'm getting more active in the Libertarian party. While I don't agree with some of their ideals (I'd rather pay some taxes and have police/fire and roads, but I think way too much in taxes are taken and it's all completely wasted by the government. Also, we need protection in place for children to thrive), they are the ones looking to strike laws down, not add more laws. Each additional law added is limiting your freedom, not giving you more.	1
Moms of AskWomen, what are things that you thought would be difficult after having children but they're easier than you thought?	ITT: All of the things that are harder than I anticipated them being. Sleeping, shopping, homework, picky eaters... I can just keep going and going.	I was always afraid about going shopping with my son. I've heard other mothers complain about it. But with my son, sometimes I take him shopping so he quits messing up my house. Obviously this depends on the child, but he's good 95% of the time. I will let him play in the mall's play area for a bit but he's happy in his stroller looking at people. He's fine anywhere with carts: grocery stores, Walmart, Target etc. He willl just look around and happily kick his feet and laugh. Obviously, a different kid may act differently	0
Women in age gap relationships, how has your relationship progressed over the years?	It never worked out for me if we were in different life stages when it began. My husband is 7 years older than me, but we met when we were 28 and 35 and in the same life stages/meeting as equals which has worked out great for us.	I am 20 and my boyfriend is 30. Our relationship seems like a dream sometimes because of how great it is! He is so kind and loving, I love the shit out of him. We communicate really well which is hard to find it feels like and we both are happiest just snuggled up next to each other doing nothing. He tells me that he would've never guessed that I was so young because apparently I don't act it which is an important aspect I suppose.	1
Women who married "up", what has dealing with your partner's family been like?	My SO's family are all very attractive and I'm rather plain. It's only ever come up once or twice but the first time I met his cousin his grandmother teased me about being standoffish and shy because I was intimidated. No, I was only there to give my SO a drive home and I didn't want to socialize because my uncle died that day.	Fairly difficult, his mother often refer to my family as "low income". She has stated many times she didn't understand how my husband could live in my house and not become sick. It wasn't the nicest but it was clean. Has often explained how although I am use to being dirty, I should learn that her standards as they are much higher and I need not to subject him to my dirtyness. He is actually a slob! So yeah my MIL definitely looks down on her southern white trash daughter in law. I just do my best to avoid her.	0
Enough of all these stupid relationship posts- who is your favourite character on TV right now and why?	Daisy Johnson from Agents of SHIELD. She's badass, an Asian WOC, clever, funny, and following her through her hero's journey from Skye to Quake has been amazing and emotional. Blair Waldorf from Gossip Girl will always be one of my favorite characters of all time. She was a total boss with a heart of gold, gorgeous, amazing wardrobe, my tastes match hers almost identically, and her romance was amazing. Fiona Gallagher from Shameless because she shows the true strength and resilience of women. I just want to protect her from the world. (I'm only on season 4, no spoilers pls!)	Rosa from Brooklyn 99. I can't decide if I want to be her or marry her. She's take no shit awesome.	0
What are some overrated personality traits and why?	Kindness. Sorry, but I don't see the point in just being nice to everything and everyone. We are humans, we have a lot of bad things in us. Hiding them won't make them go away. If you just let yourself not to be kind, you would find out that you don't have to be always kind to be a good person.	Over use of sarcasm. It's like herbs for cooking. A little sarcasm can spice things up but a whole meal of it is bitter and unpalatable.	0
Engaged/married women of Reddit! How long into your relationship did your SO propose, and how old were you?	He proposed at two months. We were 21 and 26. We have been married for 30 years. That man is the best thing to happen to me.	We met at age 17, moved in together at 19, formalized our engagement at 28, and married at 29. The first discussion of spending our life together happened at 19 (I brought it up). There was no traditional proposal; we mutually proposed, it was not a surprise, there were no engagement rings.	1
You've suddenly been granted the ability to make your dog understand one concept. Besides "I love you", what do you want to tell your dog?	When you bark, you sound scary to people who don't know you! I know you're just excited about them, but for real girl, you sound vicious. You might wanna work on that.	Don't be scared. I'm right here when anything scares you and the list of what scares you is quite long but I'm here for you, babe.	0
Ladies, What are some things your SO does after sex that makes you happy?	Sometimes after we finish he will press his forehead against mine for a moment. I don't know why but it melts my heart.	We must be weird, because we high-five and tell each other how great it was. Then we clean up and cuddle. We are a heterosexual couple.	1
What makes you unreasonably angry?	When you argue with a person whose disagreement is based on not understanding the totality of the issue rather than having an honest disagreement. Of course, if you say 'you just don't understand' you're a jerk. And I wouldn't say that. But sometimes a person needs like several classes in the subject just to get to the point of arguing and I'm just not willing to explain the constitution to you, Gerald.	Those inconsiderate asshole cyclists that just "have to be cars" on 40 mile per hour roads when there is clearly perfectly usable sidewalk. Now I have to lane change to get around you... Also people that throw cigarette butts out their car windows. Seriously pollute your own worthless car not my fucking world.	1
Ladies, what is the creepiest way someone has tried to get your attention?	I'm a 30 year old construction worker that's 6'1" and 220lbs. Every story I read on here of some poor girl makes me wish I was there to beat the shit out of the creep harassing them. Girls, on behalf of all men, I'm so sorry	I was like 14 at the time and out with a friend. It was a snow day and we were making snow men. This guy rolled up in his car, he was like at least 30+ years old and asked if we'd like to 'see his carrot'. :/ We didn't say anything and he wouldn't leave, and then he got out of the car. My friend and I ran down the road and around the corner to hide in her house. We saw him get in his car, drive around the corner and shouted for us something like "Hey pretty girls, where are you?" We stayed hidden and saw him get frustrated, at which point he kicked over all the snowmen all our neighbours had made.	0
When did you realize your friend group kinda sucked?	When I asked them to hang out and they all either ignored the question or said no. After this happened ten times in a row over a period of several months, I just gave up.	When almost all of them left my birthday party early. I later found out that they went to get pizza and see a movie and had planned it while still at my house.	1
What's the worst handling of a serious topic you've seen in a TV show or movie?	Anyone remember that movie 40 days and 40 nights? At the end that blonde chick rapes him. There are no two ways about this. She walks into his place before the time is up, jumps on his bed while he's asleep, and rapes him. And somehow this is his fault, and the girlfriend gets mad and runs away in tears, and it's never addressed at all. I was fucking appalled.	Disclaimer: I love It's Always Sunny. The one thing that really bothered me, though, was the depiction of Dee's pregnancy and giving birth. It wasn't offensive - or even as "offensive" as many of the jokes on that show have the potential to be - but there was absolutely 0 jokes about the pregnancy itself, i.e. What happens when you're pregnant (besides eating a lot). The episodes really just focused on the guys trying to figure out who the dad was - which was funny. But I think there could have been so much potential if only the show had centered on Dee's actual experience.	1
Those that suddenly moved to a different city/state/country how did you find a job and what was your process in moving?	Sell everything that doesn't fit in car Drive to new city (it was 3000 miles) Crash on friends couch while I got an apartment Find job Stay 15 years so far	When ppl go to a new country they dont just, usually, go there head on. In most cases they find a job and a place to stay (through connections/on their own) first, then they travel to that said country and settle in.	1
You rescue a sneaky genie from a bottle. How do you word your wish so it won't come back to bite you?	It might be worth my time to hire a lawyer for this one. I don't trust myself to word it as perfectly as it probably needs to be.	I'd say "I wish that you would be free" and that's all. I don't trust a genie to give me anything without screwing me over so I might as well free the bastard and make a friend	1
What's your favorite no-meat recipe?	Dumplins are always a great go-to when cooking veg. Ya can fill ya dumplins with anything, literally ANYTHING! Carrot shavins, cheese, quinoa, some soy protein, beans, lentils, spices, ya name it, ya can put it in a dumplin. And then ya gotta make some sweet, sweet dippin sauces to go along! Mmm boy! So what ya do is, ya make two or three kinds o' dumplin n two or three kinds o' dippin sauce n then serve em up! Baby, ya got yaself a lil' dumplin fest goin' on! Three dumplins n three dippin sauces is nine flava combos! Get ya bad self some dumplins!!	a little less than 2.5 dl of red lentils replaces 400 g of mince meat. i use cooked and drained lentils instead of meat for pretty much every sauce-based dish that requires crumbled meat - spaghetti sauce, taco meat, chili con carne, shepard pie, etc. if you just add a bit extra salt, i can pretty much promise you won't miss the meat!	0
Ladies, what is one thing about your partner you don't like, but deal with because you love them despite that?	He cannot plan to save his life, it drives me absolutely insane because I plan everything out: literally. I schedule meals, down to the minute that I should start cooking or prepping the food. So when he decides to do something spontaneous, it always catches me off guard and can mess up my entire day depending on when he tells me. I love that he can go with the flow and be so relaxed about everything, but boy can he throw me off sometimes.	He's not a morning person, and I definitely am. It is really annoying sometimes to not be able to plan stuff with him on the weekends till (what I consider) lunchtime. It's heightened because I'm not just an early bird, I'm one of those happy, bouncy morning people that wakes up early at 100% energy. It is usually okay, but things like finding flights or going to movies (I cannot start a film at 9PM, I'll fall asleep halfway through!) can be a bit disjointed	0
What toxic thoughts are you trying to ditch?	I always think I'm being judged for my age or for being liked by my instructors and that people are jealous of me or think I'm a b-word. I just end up as a self-doubting, self-critical mess and I have moments where I hate myself when I can't meet my own unrealistic high standards. I've driven home crying twice in the past three weeks cuz my day wasn't perfect. I cycle between thoughts "I wanna drop out of school" and "Something is wrong with me." Maybe it's actually normal to be this fucked up from high-stress, competitive environments. I hate this though and I'll never be a Type A personality. Whatever. I deal.	Currently in a new relationship (yay!) so I've been having to battle the whole the toxic thought that he might be cheating on me. He hasn't nor do I have any real indication that he would, but in line with this idea of "I'm not worthy". I know if he did do that then it'd be more telling of him than me but I just wrestle with not feeling like I'm worthy of anything so I would take up the blame even though I shouldn't in that case.	0
What things are you sick of being listed as dealbreakers?	Liking astrology it's fun and fascinating for some people and it isn't be a big deal. I see men get so ott about it.	Mental Illness. I get it, I do, but mine is managed well enough that none of my SO's knew until I told them. Just a minor annoyance.	0
That 'fuck, women have crazy good handwriting' feeling, which typical male behavior do you silently admire?	How "getting ready" can be as simple as rolling out of bed, sliding on jeans, any available t shirt, and shoes. No checking in a mirror. My boyfriend does this and somehow looks normal and ready to go. Me following these same steps, I look like a drowned rat.	One thing many men I've known have had that I am utterly lacking is this seemingly magical awareness of what direction they're facing or driving in, no matter what. It's one thing when we're in our small town, much of which is on a grid, which I can figure out, but when we're somewhere else that required twists and turns and possibly flights to get to? I just don't get it. My cursive rules, though. ;)	1
Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who recently came out of a relationship, or who quit their previous relationship to be with you? How did it go?	I have dated several men while they were going through divorces (wow, weird, maybe I have a type). It was fine. I have a tendency to overlap relationships, anyway (I haven't been partnerless since 1997, so...yeah) and I don't think it's necessary to have a specific amount of time to be single (and, to be honest, I tend to date men who fall the fuck apart if they are single).	I'd been treated like dirt by the last couple of blokes I'd been out with, and late night messaged my friend to vent about how miserable I was. Co-incidentally he had just broken up with his girlfriend the night before. We more or less decided to pity fuck each other. He was very upfront about not wanting a relationship, and I felt so broken and discarded that I just let it be a casual thing, because I honestly had no strength. However the sex was life changing, so we just kept at it. I remember one day months later he just grabbed me and kissed me and said 'I can keep my hands off you', and I knew something had shifted. It's been two-ish years now, and we have a house and an amazing future together.	0
Married/committed women of /r/askwomen , What relationship advice do you have for every young man out there?	If you're having a disagreement, don't call names. You can put this into practice in any situation, but especially with your partner. Name calling doesn't help your argument; it only serves to hurt the other person unnecessarily, and potentially make you sound ignorant. I'm not even talking about swearing -- calling someone stupid or pathetic can be just as damaging. If it doesn't work towards solving the issue, it's not worth saying.	Be trustworthy. This doesn't only go for not telling lies, which is a given (seriously though, don't lie - if you get caught, even in a little lie, it destroys the confidence your S.O. has in you). But also, show up when you say you will. On time. If you say you'll do something, do it - don't just put it off then make up some excuse why you couldn't manage it. Some of the most important qualities I know I personally looked for in a partner were trustworthiness, dependability, reliability, etc. And it really actually hurts when someone can't ever seem to make good on the promises they give.	1
You are trying to fall asleep and suddenly your brain thinks of that really embarrassing moment from when you were a kid. What is it?	Fine here's one, one my first day of kindergarten I was in a class with rowdy kids before class started and I just kind of sat in my chair where the teacher said to go as she tried to calm the other kids. I was hungry so I pulled out my lunchables and almost began to eat it before the teacher grabbed it and taped up the seal and said that it wasn't lunchtime. I think the other kids didn't care but I was weirded out how she taped it up and confiscated it, then around lunchtime I ate basically a taped up luncheable.	That time my parents gave me a really stern talking to about masturbating in the backyard tree house... because the neighbors saw me.	0
Moms and daughters of reddit, whats your best ''Don't tell dad moment''?	As a husband and father, reading some of these would make me really sad to know if this was my wife and daughter.	My mother and I once stopped by my dad's favourite cupcake shop, but they only had two left. We ate them and never mentioned it.	0
Women who have traveled alone, where did you go and would you recommend solo travel?	I went to Costa Rica for two months alone, and I loved it. You're able to make friends more easily from all over the world when you travel by yourself, and you can do whatever you want whenever you want. I've travelled with friends and S.O. before, but nothing is quite as satisfying as traveling all by yourself. You just have to be smart about it.	Chile, Europe, Hong Kong. It's not safe for women anywhere in the world, so you might as well travel whereever you want.	1
What was the absolute worst wedding you ever went to?	Not a wedding, I rarely attend those anymore. But my cousin's communion. My aunt thought it was 'different' to read a roll call of all the people who helped with the party preparations. So we sat there for 20 minutes whilst the compere read out a long list along the lines of 'Tanya's communion dress designed by ABC', 'Food catered by XYZ'. We were laughing our asses off at the stupidity of the whole thing and still laugh about it 15 years later.	When I was about 7 and my brother was 5, my father got married again. The adults left us in an empty dining room with a bartender for most of the event. I remember hiding under a table. The bar tender was nice and gave us pretzels, I think. They let us into the ceremony just to be ring-bearer with the rings on a pillow. They let us into the reception for a few minutes and my grandmother gave me 1 fork full of cake. It was lemon and I didn't like it. ETA: AFAIK no pics exist of us at this wedding with my father and stepmother, the bride & groom. Seriously, who gets married and doesn't take family pics *with their own children*.	0
How old are you and what changes in female beauty standards have you seen during your lifetime?	Eyebrows are the big one to me. I remember in high school, a lot of the girls I knew plucked or waxed their brows down to almost nothing. Then a fuller look came back into vogue and everyone started scrambling, but I know one of my friends had plucked hers down so much they couldn't grow back.	People want big butts now. Butts are the new boobs. Also, for some reason people are obsessed with these big thick eyebrows on women. Makes me want to gag. To me, you look like a man. I like having some hair on my snooch. I shave everything "under", but I like to leave a patch on top. For a while there you couldn't have any hair otherwise there was something wrong with you. I just don't follow any of these rules. I like what I like and that's it.	1
Besides medication and therapy what other things helped you through depression?	Break things down and write a plan. "Clean a bedroom" is too much to think of sometimes if you're severely depressed. So instead, you write down 'vaccuum' and that's what you do. In the words of Kimmy Schmidt, you can stand anything for ten seconds.	I lost my shit on lexapro and quit that shit real fast. I enjoyed reading a whole bunch. Creative workbooks were really fun for me. I also did this thing called "tapping" where I tapped on my temples, wrists, hands and would close my eyes to just feel that sensation. And being outside barefoot. Feeling the elements really centered me.	1
What things does your SO do to keep you feeling giddy and excited?	He calls me "babalooski" when he's really happy. It's such a silly thing that started out as "babe." And he says it in a silly voice. It always makes me feel so incredibly special and I couldn't tell you why. Also when he calls just to chat. He haaates talking on the phone, so I know when he does that it's just for me. It's nice that he goes out of his way to do something that makes me happy. (:	Some days it's just the way he looks at me, or gives me a forehead kiss, or anything tender really. It's just a fleeting moment that it feels like an electric shock running through me. It's beautiful. On a smaller scale it's every time he tells me he misses me.	0
What are the most striking or odd examples of men coming up with would-be solutions to women's problems?	When I was little and my jelly shoes would pinch me, my dad would put them in the microwave and then he and my uncle would each take and end and try and stretch them out. I don't actually think it worked but I have a very vivid memory of it.	Not a solution to a problem, quite the opposite-I'm 100% sure a man designed my bathroom. I have this huge, gorgeous shower with no place to put up my legs to shave them. I put a shower chair in there so I can shave my legs without contorting.	1
Have you ever been in a "great friends, terrible roommates" situation? How did it work out for you?	I have a lot of trouble living with anyone but I find it worse with close friends. I am more sensitive to them and find it hard to express how I feel with living arrangements because I fear losing their friendship as well so it complicates things so much more. Things got much better when they moved out though. Everything was less tense when the little things that you had to deal with constantly were out of the way.	Reading all these comments makes me eternally grateful for my best friend/roommate. We lived together last summer when her dad relocated to a job in a different state and still had a few months left on his apartment lease and it was awesome. It was one of the first places I ever felt truly comfortable and at home. We're planning on moving in together again this summer since I just went through a painful breakup and had to move back into my parents' house and I can't wait. We're both really intuitive of each other's feelings and we both regularly buy toiletries/groceries/whatever we need when we're living together. Plus, we both clean up after ourselves. I love living with her. I hope everybody here now has/finds a great roommate that they enjoy living with! <3	1
Do you think there are any ways in which society has gone backward, and not forward, in being understanding and progressive?	Soooo many things to do with babies. From the right way to carry them in the backpack things for them to sit right and how cosleeping is horribly wrong. People have been carrying babies and cosleeping for soooo long why is it suddenly so horrible?	I feel like a few years ago nobody cared about trans people using the "correct" bathroom. Now it's a huge debate.	0
Former adult industry workers, what were some of the unexpected challenges/surprises you experienced when returning to the "normal" workforce?	Does stripping count? The great thing about stripping was the cash and attention...but I realized this was not for me; you can't keep stripping forever. Keeping a regular 8-5 is much more rewarding due to having health and dental benefits with a full-time job. :-)	I have worked for porn stores and they are very different from other retail places in the amount of power/trust placed in employees. Someone making you uncomfortable? Kick then out. Someone say they are pro-Bush and they are being a jerk (this was 2004)? Give them a flyer on how Bush is anti-porn and kick them out. Someone call you a bitch or make a move on you? Kick them out. No manager involvement. No asking permission. If someone bothered me, I told them to leave. Management would tell them to fuck off and never come back if they complained about it or demanded management.	0
How do you playfully mess with your SO?	I will explain the punch line of jokes on tv, and when he says "I know", I say "you know NOW", while patting his hand affectionately, "because I explained it to you".	Walking down the street on a rainy day. Found a child's sock on top of a fire hydrant. Put it in her mouth. The look was priceless	1
Women who look young -- how does it affect you in professional situations?	I'm a bartender and most people seem to think I'm 19. I'm actually 24. Customers sometime walk up to me and ask if I'm allowed to work behind the bar and I feel like some customers go easier on me when I screw uop just because they think I'm just a teenager. I kind of don't care that much, but it did annoy me quite a lot at the beginning. I was afraid that people wouldn't take me seriously, but it hasn't been the case so far.	I get stopped in the halls during class and yelled at. I have people yell "where is your teacher?!" When I'm sitting right there at the teacher's desk. I've had a security guard try and take my phone. I've gotten multiple threats to tow my car for parking in the faculty parking lot. The kids are constantly trying to find out if I party or smoke weed. I'm a high school substitute teacher and I'm 29. (I sub at multiple high schools so security/other teachers don't always recognize me) EDIT: I want to add that I love my job and most of the time I don't get yelled at, I just have gotten yelled at before, for being in the halls during class time before or for sitting at the teachers desk or parking in the faculty lot.	0
Women who don't like your current partner but are still with them - what's your story? Where is the relationship heading?	I feel like I'm the bad significant other in these threads. I've gained a good portion of weight and I'm a handful with my depression. I'm somewhat preparing mentally for my so to end things.	To every top commenter: >Don't be scared to speak >Don't speak with someone's tooth >Don't bargain when you're weak >Don't take that sharp abuse >Some patients can't be saved >But that burden's not on you >Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that (10+x)	1
Women who didn't take their husband's name, how did you make that decision and what lead to it? Are you glad you still have your maidenname?	Not married yet, but I won't be taking his name. I see no reason why I would want to or what purpose it would serve for us. And I'm known professionally by my name, in an industry that is 90% based on networking, familiarity, and reputation. Changing my name would confuse that. I also love my name and love my family. I'm happy to have my name. I can't see any circumstance in which I would regret it.	You know what would be cool? If when we get married we smushed the two last names together in a mutually agreeable way.	1
I'm sick of reading relationships horror stories on /r/relationships and elsewhere. What are some of the reasons you love being in a relationship?	We ran out of tortillas so he made me nachos. Omg. Now he's chilling with our 2 year old while I take a short break. He's awesome.	My fiancé is my best friend. Being in a relationship to me is like living with my best friend who I can also fuck and it's awesome.	0
Women who took their husband's name and subsequently divorced, what did you do about your name?	This is sort of from a different perspective (I wrote my own as well in another comment), but my SO is very irritated that his ex wife is still using his last name. It's interesting to think about the male perspective on this - it never crossed my mind until he mentioned it. So, I've started to believe that maybe it should be decided in the divorce by *both* parties whether she keeps his last name or not.	I will have to make this decision in a couple of months! I do like my married name and know many women who have kept it post divorce, but I am ready to move on. But I'm not sure I want to revert to my maiden name either. It was suggested to me that I take another family name, something way back from the family tree. I like that idea.	0
What fashion trend (for women or men) are you impatiently waiting to come back into style?	Nice roomy stone washed dad jeans - like Levis 560s. White leather tennis shoes. Gray or dark red Champion Sweatshirts or College alma mater sweat shirts or New England Patriots sweatshirts. New England Patriots boxer shorts Black belt and a nice New England Patriots fanny pack to hold my wallet, phone and the digital picture frame with the 300 pictures and the 17 second Gif I have of the time I met Tom Brady. Edit: also the banana hammock swimsuit for men. So *liberating*. Men will truly feel empowered if they ever come back in.	The 90s are back but I can't find any of the chunky shoes I used to wear back then. I'm waiting for stores to fill up on chunky Oxfords again.	0
What is something Redditors advise/advise against about dating &amp; relationships that you disagree with?	This isn't really a Reddit thing, but I often see it in TV and movies where the protagonist is encouraged to confess their feelings to someone they're interested in, when that someone is already in a relationship that the protag knows about. "Tell them how you feel" they'll be advised. Seriously, never do this. Don't go trying to sabotage other people's relationships just because you have a crush. Whether it works or not, you're a douche.	I think that telling someone their partner cheated on them is 99.9% of the time a terrible idea. Unless you have irrefutable evidence, just leave it alone. It's not your relationship to proctor.	1
Why Send Nudes?	As a lesbian, it's not just dudes who enjoy getting nudes. I've sent them and have received them but it's something I do with trusted partners (not hookups/casuals) as a type of foreplay. Yes, obviously they get to see "the real thing" whenever they want but sending a few teasing pictures back and forth when we aren't physically together is fun and flirty! I've never felt even a little bit fearful about my pictures being spread around though. I guess I just feel like my exes are mature enough that the idea would never cross their mind quite frankly.	I would never in a million years do that. I don't see the appeal, and I also think it's extremely risky. In my opinion, society has really done a disservice to people by promoting this activity as no big deal because it can have very serious consequences.	1
Why do people always assume youre a dude on the internet?	As a guy, I think it's because when we were all growing up and the Internet was young, it WAS mostly guys on these sites. I remember being a kid and having girls think we were nerdy for liking being on the computer and doing things like YouTube or whatnot. I guess the times have changed and more girls are online but the perception is still there	I dunno. I actually often assume people I'm talking to are dudes on the internet also, much to my chagrin.	0
What is your most "politically correct" opinion?	A little bit of tact and understanding can go a long way when talking to people who hold different values and views.	Racism, sexism, and other systems of oppression refer to prejudice *plus power.* It's only in the colloquial usage of the words that they can go both ways. For purposes of academic discussion and research, they can only go one way in any given society.	1
Girls, which do you prefer, tampon or menstrual pads, and why?	Fucking neither. If I don't have to work I just make frequent trips to the bathroom, take plenty of showers, and use panty liners. My flow is weird and really heavy in the beginning but if I use a tampon during the day it works for a couple hours but then it stops my flow and comes out full force at night when I'm not using one. I fucking hate pads too. I hate it all. Dealing with a period just sucks. Towards the end of my cycle it's not a big deal but at the beginning I'll use tampons if I have to. I've never tried a cup but my flow is pretty heavy so I think it'd be more inconvenient than anything.	Tampons by far. I've used them since day one. Pads make me feel like I'm just sitting in it for hours and it's really uncomfortable for me. Plus tampons just seem more practical to me for some reason. Pads are also less environmentally friendly, though neither are ideal.	0
How happy are you with your physical appearance, and do you think "society" and "the media" have played a part in your views?	Eh, not entirely happy. I think the media has played a role in how I think people look without makeup vs how they actually look. I'm alright with my body shape for the most part; it's how I look without makeup and general flaws like unwanted hair or blemishes.	Not particularly happy that the apex of male beauty is either lumberjack guy or Matt Bomer(no one can reach this man's good looks. Not natural) Meanwhile the guy that's trying to get in shape so he doesn't have a stroke at 48 like his mother, avoid familial diabetes and high blood pressure, gets the "you should get in shape then women will want you". I'm not saying I shouldn't get in shape but why only then will women want a guy/or women in some cases. Isn't that a little vain? "Oh now you are acceptable to notice" type of thing?	1
Ladies making over $100k per year, what do you do?	Nurse Practitioner. If you are a nurse, I highly urge you to go back for your masters degree. There is all this chatter about "there won't be any jobs" but I'm telling you, nurse practitioners are about to be in high demand and you will forever have a job, just like nurses will.	I have a question. I am still in school looking at going in to Child life specialist getting my masters in it as well. What can I expect to get salary-wise? Also is anyone here a Child Life Specialist? Thanks	1
What do women get that men don't?	I think kind of the burden of pregnancy? If women want a biological child, the only realistic option if you're not made of money is to grow it inside yourself and then either cut or push it out at great physical cost. It's definitely a stressful thing that looms in my future.	A period. And occasionally sore boobs. (I refuse to believe that because my genitals are shaped differently from a man's, that I'm capable to "getting" something that he doesnt. Lack of understanding isn't a gender thing. It's a human thing)	1
Mothers of AW, what's something your child does/did, that made you think "that's so mini me"?	One time I watched him cut his pancake into tiny pieces and pour syrup on each individual piece while being very careful to make sure the syrup didn't spill over. That's how I knew he belonged to me.	Don't have kids, BUT I have two kittens. My little boy kitten Clint likes to sleep with a paw dramatically thrown across his eyes, just like I do. I didn't think my girl kitten Natasha was that similar to me, until I asked my SO how something so small takes up so much space and he pointed out that I do exactly the same thing when I sleep.	1
Mothers of AW, have you ever teamed up with your child to play a prank on your SO? What was the prank?	I was the child. My mum came across her boyfriend's car and decided it would be funny to write "you smell of poo" on one of the windows using lipstick. It was so funny I couldn't help but tell him who did it as soon as we next saw him.	Last year she wanted to do something for April Fool's, so we smeared the toilet seat with Vaseline. She was only 7yo and couldn't stop giggling, so of course, he saw it.	0
What drugs have you tried recreationally?	When I went to festivals I tried my fair share, though I was really careful where I got them and from who, also how much I did. I've tried: Mushrooms, Ecstacy, MDMA/MDA, LSD, Mushrooms, Ketamine, Salvia, weed. I want to try DMT if I meet someone I really trust. I tried some designer drugs once, 2CB I believe. It really just felt like mushrooms with a bad crash afterward. Personally, I don't really do much anymore, sometimes mushrooms during the summer. I made a point never to do anything up my nose or things I felt could be addictive.	Weed, MDMA, psilocybin (shrooms), LSD, cocaine. I've enjoyed them all and take great care to only use them on rare occasions, particularly cocaine (it just disappears so easily...). It hasn't been a problem for my SO and I. Having said that, it's absolutely not for everyone.	0
AW, what are some stereotypes a lot of men have about women that you've never experienced as true irl?	For me personally, most of them. The idea that women can have sex with hot guys whenever they want is particularly annoying because it only works that way if you're conventionally attractive. If you're not, you get ignored.	I have been rejected, even for sex. I have only once had a guy buy me a drink. I love my female friends and genuinely want them to succeed.	0
Aside from the illegal or immoral, what is something that you will not pay money for?	I absolutely refuse to buy any meat, animal products and items tested on animals. (Yes, I'm vegan) We all say we love animals and we're against animal cruelty. But we pay people to mutilate, torture and slaughter animals FOR US...and it's not for any necessity, it's not because we need to for our health, it's just because we like the way they taste.	I won't pay money to get my own money out of the bank. (I make exceptions overseas, but fuck paying ATM fees at home). Edit: not American, these lovely suggestions won't help me I'm afraid.	0
What's one thing you've realized as you've gotten older?	Make an effort to spend time with the people you truly care about, because one day they could be gone, suicide, stroke at 49, cancer, etc. Don't waste time on the negative Nancys. No offense meant to any actual Nancys out there.	My energy is not infinite. It isn't a 'waste' of a day to spend it vegging out, if it means I will be rested and productive tomorrow.	0
How much do you REALLY drink?	When I'm traveling for work? 2 ciders and a cocktail at least per night. Sometimes way more, usually tons of pre-gaming with vodka. It's how we cope with the shitty work we have to do. On an average week? One drink, tops. I'd rather have soda.	Wow this thread makes me feel like an alcoholic. I usually have a drink most nights with dinner, usually wine but sometimes beer. On weekends I have 2-4 drinks per night. Type of alcohol varies depending on my mood and context. I should probably drink less.	0
To all the lazy people of AskWomen, what's your favorite easy recipe?	I take a shovel (or spade) and dig several 2'x2' holes in my backyard near the junk pile. Gently sift through the holes with you hands and pick out worms, grubs, and insects. Put them in your pocket, and give them a good whack so they stop their squirming. Then fill the holes with some junk (this isn't necessary but you might as well do something productive) and bury it. Now you have plenty of food in your pocket to munch on throughout the day and your yards got less junk in it.	i do a lot of egg-in-a-hole-s. take a small glass (juice glasses are perfect, but who has juice glasses anymore? shot glasses are just barely too small. champagne flutes often work nicely), "cut" (press) a hole through the bread. spray a pan, heat it up, put the bread in, crack an egg in the middle, add pepper, cook one side. spray what is currently the top, and flip it over. let it cook, add a dash of salt, eat.	0
How does being an overweight woman affect your everyday life?	I don't think it affects me too much based on what other people think/do, because I don't notice anything. But the way I feel about myself royally sucks. It is a constant cycle of trying to eat better and exercise, followed by not seeing results, followed by "fuck it I'll eat what I want," followed by the shame and guilt of eating absolute shit, and then starting over with trying to eat better. Repeat cycle indefinitely.	I'm no longer overweight, but I spent a few years in that category in my early to mid 20's before making a conscious effort to get healthier. I had been a normal weight, then put on some pounds in grad school. Physically, I was constantly tired, always needing to take a nap and never feeling fully rested. Running, an activity I had done for years, became a painful chore. My back would ache after sitting in my office chair for a few hours. Socially, I avoided photos and shopping for clothes. I was dating and looking back I did find people were attracted to me, there were a few instances of some friends I wanted something more with but they did not feel the same way. Hard to tell if it was due to my weight or other factors although the weight probably didn't help.	1
Would you date someone if they wanted to sleep in separated beds? Or different rooms?	Absolutely. It would be my preference, actually. I'm possessive of my space and I like to sprawl out in bed. I don't mind sharing from time to time, but I'm most comfortable sleeping alone.	No. I need to cling to when I get afraid at night. If he's a snorer, I make him getting a sleep apnea test (and a CPAP) one of my limits.	1
How would/do you come to terms with the fact you're unattractive?	This is such a rich topic and I am so interested in the responses. I am not unattractive. I am social, slender, caucasian, and can be very flirtatious. I feel that I get special treatment and can get away with quite a lot because of my appearance, primarily around men. With that comes a lot of false friendships and unwanted attention. I have always wondered how my life would be different if I was unattractive. What are your experiences being unattractive in terms of how you are treated in the workplace, building friendships, ect.? Struggles? Benefits? What discoveries have you made?	I haven't really come to terms with it. It's a thorn in my side. On good days, I'm able to console myself with the knowledge that the deficit in my looks has forced me to cultivate other qualities that distinguish me from the crowd, but frankly even that's cold comfort when I see people without the aforesaid qualities *still* get preferential treatment just because they're better looking than me.	0
What is the hardest part of dating you?	I'm very independent and need a lot of alone time. I also care for people but am not very emotionally expressive.	My best friend is a guy, and I don't tolerate any jealously from any potential partners about that. Either accept that we're friends and we're going to do things just the two of us, or gtfo.	1
Women of reddit, what are your favourite pet/nicknames to be called while dating?	I told my SO that I didn't like 'babe', so now he calls me 'Captain' or 'Cap'. I kind of love it :)	None. If someone called me babe or honey, I would have to say something. If they didn't stop, I would ghost them.	1
Have any of you seen '13 Reasons Why' on Netflix? What did you think of it?	Clay deserved to be on those tapes tbh. He did fuck all when he should have stepped in, be marginally more supportive, and then tried to make up for it in the worst ways possible.	It was amazing. I binged it all in a day and a half. I felt so raw afterwards. Most well-made Beats by Dre commercial yet.	0
What's the hardest lesson you had to learn in life?	Nobody deserves anything in life. If you want something, you'll have to earn it. You don't get a prize for going through hardship. People who are less fortunate than you are working harder to achieve the same goals as you so there's really no reason for you to slack off. No matter what you've been through, there are others who have been through worse and are now doing better than you. So, really, where you end up in life is only a consequence of what choose to do; you can't push the buck to "circumstances".	Mother is not always right. Or nice, or kind, or even reasonable. It's hard to unlearn things that were deeply ingrained into your childhood.	0
What's the creepiest or most unsettling person you have ever met? What made them so disturbing?	There's a woman who walks around the town I live in, she has a walking cane and is always dressed in long black dresses and skirts. She looks like a witch and gives off this terrible vibe! Her eyes look dead... She hasn't done anything particularly creepy that I know about, but the few times I've seen her she's irked me. The closest I've been to her is walking up a ramp at a shopping center and she was behind me. I had chills and I don't know why. She could be a lovely lady, but something about her is just so off.	A co-worker's cousin at a cook out. He had dead eyes and a weird vibe. He looked at everyone kind of weird, but the way he looked at women felt predatory. Any time I broke from conversations with others, he appeared. He kept bringing up how people are touch-starved these days, especially men. I just kept saying, "that's deep" and would dart off to find someone to talk to. The fourth time he brought up men being touch-starved, he asked what guys should do and got way too close. I told him he should get out my face and go get a fucking 10-minute chair massage.	0
What is a societal norm you vehemently protest?	Becoming more and more of a norm, but I refuse to liken a pet to a child. To me, there are so many class implications with that one - when my crunchy, cute, hip friend calls her dog her "baby," and liken it to actual parenting, people think it's adorable, but if a homeless person did it, they'd be committed. Mostly, though, I just don't view pets as people.	Playing games with men. I've never done it, and I don't really know how to. I've never followed that 'Wait-X-Dates-Before-You-Fuck' rule, which always seemed a bit archaic like men are the only people who want to fuck and it's women's job to be a gatekeeper? But also that 'wait for him to text you' and 'wait for him to ask YOU out on a second date' never appealed to me, but it may also come across as creepy to dudes who are so into those societal expectations already. Iunno	0
What's your most embarrassing moment while in front of your SO?	The first time I visited his family, I asked where the bathroom was and they pointed me in the general direction. I see a bathroom, I poop some gross looking diarrhea, I flush the toilet, nothing happens. I quietly tell my fiance, turns out that toilet was broken and I was supposed to use the *other* bathroom. So he goes in and tries to plunge it and fiddle with things to get it to flush, it doesn't work, so he asks his dad. Then his parents both come in and stand around, trying to get my diarrhea to go down their toilet.	He tried to go down on me for the first time, but I had issues with vulva pain and it really hurt. I asked him to stop and he immediately did, but then I felt so guilty because my boyfriend really likes to please people and I know he wanted to please me (because I've given him blowjobs), so I started crying really hard. He hugged me and told me he wasn't upset at all for himself, he just felt bad that it was hurting me and that I couldn't enjoy it because of the pain. That made me feel a lot better, but it was still embarrassing for me to cry like that.	1
What complaint about men are you absolutely sick of hearing?	I have a bunch but I guess I'll stick to this one, since it directly pertains to me: The idea that older men who seek out younger women (18+ obviously) are gross. As long as everyone is consenting, those people can fuck off and mind their own business.	That men aren't empathetic. What a bleak outlook on half of humanity to say that they don't have something that is universal to human expirience.	0
How long were your SO and you together before you stole their favorite hoodie?	My husband hates hoodies, so I've never seen him wear one. I'd be creeped out if he did. Of the guys I've dated who wear hoodies, I've never borrowed or stolen one. I can handle being around guys, but hoodies seem to soak up the smell of their deodorant or body spray and saturate to smell of choking me if I try to wear it. I'm really sensitive to smells and can't handle strong ones for long periods of time, so hoodies are safe from me.	I offered my SO a sacrificial hoodie on our second date, so she wouldn't steal my actual favorite hoodie. So far, my countermeasures have worked	0
What have your past relationships taught you?	If someone cheats or quickly breaks up with their SO for you, they'll do it to you just as quickly. Some people are too lazy to put any effort into being functional. Drop them. Don't chase them. If they're interested, they'll reciprocate. Not reciprocating? They're not interested. Move on. When things are right, they will be awesome. When they're not, trust what you know and look at the situation objectively. It will hurt, but just cut it off when you realize it. Don't wait. It only makes it worse.	+ gender roles suck ass + someone who needs an "admirer" to deal with feeling inadequate/undesirable/whatever needs someone who's not me	1
What is an immature or unrealistic relationship expectation that you've encountered or think is too common in today's society?	The expectation that you will just meet someone perfect for you despite not putting any time or effort into meeting new people. I have a few single friends who just seem to think a partner will fall into their laps one day and they don't need to do any of the pursuing.	That a man has to pay for everything. In today's day and age that's absolutely ridiculous to expect but so many women look to find men who will 'rescue' them.	1
Fat women: What is your experience being the "fat friend"?	Con: Men ignore you and treat you like the gatekeeper. Pro: you never get trapped in conversations with strange men while out with your friends and other women don't get threatened by you. You seem funny, easy to be around, and approachable. Girls were telling me their secrets right and left Con: You lose the weight and some of those same girls start acting weird and competitive with you, passive aggressive and on edge. So your friends might not be the people you think they are. You are their "makes me look better and feel better about themselves" friend.	My friend's boyfriends wouldn't have any problems unleashing their fury on me, physically and verbally, because their girlfriends (my shit friends) got a kick out of it. But interestingly, the nicer ones always got dumped. I've once even convinced a girl not to date guy because I didn't think I would survive. My worst experience was having one of my slightly less overweight friends lose the weight. She'd been mean before, afterwards she was cruel. We'd been childhood friends but she changed so much we don't see each other much anymore. She's said she misses me but I'm not about to be her punching bag, even if it is for old times sake.	1
What kind of alcoholic drinks do you recommend for a beginner (a.k.a. a lightweight that doesn't like the taste of beer)?	I would do Vodka, Sprite and a splash of Grenadine. Or a Long Island Ice Tea. Or margarita, frozen with sugar on the rim. I still don't like the taste of most alcohol.	I always recommend vanilla vodka and cranberry juice, which tastes like cherry cheesecake, or pineapple juice and Malibu rum just because it tastes like juice. Those are usually my go-to drinks when I'm out just because I'm not really a fan of the taste of strong alcohol.	0
Ugly/unattractive women: what is your experience being the ugly friend?	Not a woman. Just my little two cents I was the shy kid when i was younger, had a hard time dealing with my stage fright and talking to people I didn't know. However, after getting over my fear of speaking to people I love making people smile, their appearances does not matter to me. I compliment everybody when possible, even something as little as "you have a great smile" can surely brighten up someone's day. I just want everybody to be awesome to each other ):	I don't consider myself unattractive but I have a best friend that's a smoke show. You get left talking to the nice wingman a lot and holding purses.	0
How do you feel about "word art" decorations? I.e., "live, laugh, love" decals, "always kiss me goodnight" signs, and "in this house, we do X, Y, Z" posters?	Not for me. Kind of tacky. But you do you. I'm sure people think my framed movie posters and comic book decorations are childish. I do not care.	It's ugly and obnoxious. My feelings towards them are a mix of hatred and amusement. My extended family all decorates their homes with these things. The have "live, laugh, love" decals, pinteresty hand painted signs with bible quotes, patriotic quotes and sayings that romanticise the first half of the 20th century all over the place. They can decorate however they want, it's not my home. Whenever I'm given things like that, it usually ends up at Goodwill or I sand off the quotes if it's on something I'd use. And I know it isn't kind, but sometimes I'll snap pictures of these things and send it to friends who love cringy shit.	1
What's the littlest thing someone has said that's upset you, because it showed how little they actually know you?	When someone says X pair of shoes are too expensive. O-o Maybe for you but nor for me. Plus, I have soft-sensitive feet and invest in quality & comfortable footwear. I don't wear cheap shoes that will f'ck up my feet. Prefer to invest in high quality shoes than have dozens of low quality shoes that are crap. I know countless women in their 20's & 30's who have f'cked up feet for wearing cheap low quality shoes, with bunions, hammer toes, sores, etc., They have to have surgery while I have feet that are presentable and good to go! :))	"Where can you get the best crab cakes in town?" "Mom, I don't know. I'm allergic to shellfish." Every. Visit.	0
My SIL is pregnant, but husband and I don't plan on procreating any time soon (if ever). What are some tactful, graceful, and/or funny ways to respond to "You're next!" comments?	If it's an older person saying it to you, say it back to them at the next funeral you're both at	I once heard someone suggest, "Every time someone says that, we wait another year." I still haven't decided if it's funny or rude, could go either way.	0
In honour of Sean Spicer, what's your most embarrassing public speaking moment?	At the end of my senior year of college I had to give a presentation on my thesis for one of my majors. I launched into a detailed analysis of Kant's influence on the evolution of studies/theories relating to epistemology. Then, I saw my major advisor stick his hand up above his head. I smiled and returned his air-high-five as I continued my presentation. Turned out, he was just signaling how much time I had left.	Not really public speaking, but I once said a friend's parent had her chest pushed down a bit because I saw it in an Asterix comic when younger without realising what it actually meant. Now I do, I will never be able to live that down.	1
What's a feeling you need to just vent because saying it in real life would do more harm than good?	I have this new coworker and i just hate her, mostly irrationally. There was some confusion when she got hired and it looked like she'd been hired to take some shifts that were supposed to be mine. We worked all that out and I actually talked to her and apologized for being chilly. But now I just find her so damn obnoxious. She's super bubbly and overeager and grating to me. I felt guilty about it cus ~LADY SOLIDARITY~ but I realized that nobody likes EVERYONE and it's ok for me to be annoyed by her. I'm not a jerk to her, I'm perfectly cordial. I just avoid being with her 1-on-1.	My job is so boring, but I need it because it pays a lot more than any other job I could get, and my long term goal is slowly becoming closer to reality. I am not challenged, I work on a team I don't mesh with, the work itself is boring, the culture is weird, and I feel like it is making me a boring/uncreative person. This is the reason people become so dull. I know it's temporary (contract worker/3 year contract), and I get to work near my BIL (who I am close with, we get lunches twice a week), but it's soul sucking. At least my other jobs were interesting. This is just... mind numbing.	0
What's the best thing you've bought at a thrift store?	I buy pretty much all my books used or borrow them. Children's books you can get real cheap at book sales, like 25 cents. I also buy all my son's clothes used at Goodwill or consignment. I found him this adorable little track suit in this easy to spot and follow neon yellow for $3. But the best thing? I bought this boring vase for $1 at a yard sale with the intent of storing my spatulas in it. After Googling the engravings, I sold it for $150.	A suit that I presume the previous owner never wore because the pockets weren't cut open for 6.50. I've out grown it though (damn my tits) so it's recently gone back to goodwill.	1
What is your 'oh fuck i am an idiot' moment?	Yesterday I put my external hard drive in my backpack, then immediately got up from my backpack and started searching my house, looking for that same external hard drive so I could put it in that same backpack, all the while thinking to myself "I could swear I just saw it but I don't remember where." I put it exactly where I wanted it, then immediately forgot. It took me an hour to realize it was already put away, after I'd already given up on it and returned to my backpack for something else.	My boyfriends dad bought me a used phone but when he gave it to me we realized there was a crack in the camera lense causing the picture to be foggy, so we had to replace it. We came back a week later and he had all the tools to replace it. When I put the new piece on and tried to take a picture it was still foggy and couldn't figure out why. I realized after 10 minutes that I had put it on wrong and as soon as I fixed it, it worked perfect. I tried to play it off but they both laughed at me. :(	1
Thinking back on an unhealthy relationship, what were the biggest red flags/signs early on that you missed?	I've posted this before in other threads. He would be extremely mean to people (family, friends, not just me) and brush it off as teasing, make the person feel like they had no sense of humor. But if he was teased in even a mild way, he'd flip out. It sounds small, but that was the first sign that something was really wrong.	Both of the unhealthy relationships I had started out with me being treated like a princess, showered in gifts and made to feel so unbelievably special. They both told me they loved me far too early. However, these two individuals also worked to isolate me from friends and family.	1
Women who moved to a different country, are you happier ? What made you move ?	I moved to a different country because of a job opportunity. I'm happy, but I'd honestly be happy living anywhere apart from the town I grew up in.	I moved because I had a miserable childhood, and only poor memories of growing up. Best thing I ever did., quite literally. Possibly my smartest decision ever.	0
What unrealistic expectations do young men have about women?	Some young men expect you to be their mommyyyyyyyyyt:c mommyyyy where are you mommyyyy. Go die I am not such a thing. If anything I'm more like your bitter old grandfather. Bye	That our vaginas will smell like fresh flowers and clean laundry or whatever. I mean, it shouldn't smell *bad*, or fishy, but it DOES have a smell, and it is NOT like mangoes or cotton candy or whatever they fuck they seem to think it should smell like. Also, like a lot of other posters in this thread, I feel like a lot of the boys I dated in high school were way too horrified about periods, body hair, and other natural functions of the female body. They seemed to not want to acknowledge that girls are just people.	0
Poor, broke, and down on your luck ladies, what are some things financially stable people say that annoy you?	If you're complaining about how broke you are, I know you're doing better than I am. I'll sit there, listen & nod, "oh yeah, that's tough," but I'm conserving my energy for surviving. Getting angry at the people in my life who having no concept of value just fills me with hatefulness. I have enough problems without that emotional stress. When you're drinking extra water to keep the hunger pains down, you don't talk about that shit. You don't want anyone to know. My new hatefulness/financial stress buster is singing a song called "knocking on wood" by Spose. Gotta choose between paying the bills and having grocery money again? Rock out, loudly.	I make a decent living but it still bothers me when people make assumptions about others' finances, like "Oh it's only $5, everyone can afford that." No. Not everyone can afford that. It also *really* bothers me when other people make decisions with my money. "I bought this spa weekend. I figured we'd all go and chip in $50." It may only be $50 but it's my money, not yours to spend. My family does this to me all the time.	0
Books that every girl should read?	If you've never been poor, I'd highly recommend Nickel and Dimed. It's a nonfiction book where the author attempts to live in three different cities in the US on low wages. It all seems intuitive to me but I grew up poor - for friends who haven't been, it's been really eye opening to see all of the costs associated with being poor. For example, if you can't afford to pay for the deposit on an apartment, you get stuck paying high prices to live in a hotel. Because you're paying more to live in the hotel than you would in rent, you can never save up for that deposit. Whereas someone who is doing okay financially, or can borrow money from parents or something, they're able to pay the deposit and get a cheaper apartment.	Eleanor and Park. I'm so in love with that novel. I think it's a great coming of age story for a teenage girl.	1
Vegan women, what finally made you cross the fence and become vegan?	I worked on one of those "organic local humane" dairy farms, the kind that sell their goods at farmer's markets. I was horrified and disgusted after only a few days. That was 12 years ago and I've been totally vegan ever since.	I guess I just realised I was a hypocrite - I said I loved animals, yet I ate them. It had actually been eating at me at the back of my mind for a few years but the thought of changing my lifestyle was overwhelming. I would tell myself 'well the animal is already dead so I might as well eat it' to make myself feel better. I started working with a vegan guy and saw that it really wasn't hard to be vegan. I watched a few documentaries and read stuff online to kind of answer questions I was too self conscious to ask my friend and I guess a switch just flicked and I realised how messed up it was to eat other living beings and treat them as commodities, like milk producing and egg laying machines. It's like seeing the world through different eyes. *cue downvotes*	1
HR of reddit: What are some common interview mistakes you see? What are some signs that an interview is going well/not well?	When the manager sits in the interview and was late to sit in with the supervisor interviewing you...then proceeds the whole time texting on her phone following the interview being interrupted by her cell phone. The ringer continued to go off and the interview was quickly derailed after this interupption. As the interviewee I found this extremely rude.	It seems so obvious, but show up on time. Give yourself way more time than you think you'd need. It's better to just sit in a coffee shop for 20 minutes than to show up late.	0
What do you wish your parents had done differently when raising you?	I slightly wish there was more emphasis on physical activity and healthy eating--or at least that we had done more together as a family. I would never put all the blame on my parents instead of myself, but if I'd grown up with more models of physical activity=fun!, I might not be quite as fat and lazy as I am now. Maybe. I don't know.	I wish they would've made me read more. I can only imagine what my vocabulary would've been like had I spent more time reading book than watching pointless TV shows.	1
What do you think of Creedence Clearwater Revival?	Eh. I'm sure there are ccr songs I would like, but it just always seemed kind lame. Never really given them a chance though, so who knows.	They're one of my go-to bands to play at social gatherings. Like, how can you have a bad time listening to CCR?	0
Women who date women. How are your relationships different than hetero relationships?	Women are used to being the ones to be approached. So, I always am the one to make the first move, since otherwise we'd both be shy at each-other forever and it'd never go anywhere.	Eh, drama is drama. My first experience with lesbian relationships was through roller derby. Plenty of drama. The majority was derby-based. The rest was just standard relationship drama. Relationships are relationships.	1
How was your weekend?	My husband and I moved into our new house! And I celebrated my 30th birthday with my friends. I'm exhausted but very happy :)	I left the house twice... once to go see Fate of the Furious (this one I showered and got dressed for) and the second time was to literally drive once around my block to hit a Pokéstop and to catch a Pokémon so that I didn't lose my daily streak. Otherwise it was a couch-heavy weekend full of snacks, clearing out the DVR, playing Disney Emoji Blitz and a little bit of wedding planning.	1
What was the most misguided piece of advice a man has ever given you?	I had many a male mentor tell me when I was younger that I would have to work harder than my male counterparts to reach the same goals. That's a blatant lie. I work just as hard as anyone else, have my times when I slack off, and have reached the exact same goals. My Vagina doesn't make my life an uphill battle and your penis doesn't make you any more of a millionaire.	"Don't watch sports? You should at least watch watch Sports Center so you have something to talk to men about." I find it hilarious now, but at the time I was stunned. Why would I waste an hour every day on something I don't care about to present a false interest to men? Now I have a partner with an equal disinterest in sports. It's perfect.	0
What is the worst decision you've ever made?	I would say it was rushing into a shitty marriage with my soon-to-be-ex-husband, but then I wouldn't have my daughter, so it's hard to say. So I'll go with taking on so much student loan debt.	"Smokers get more breaks from work, I'm going to smoke just this summer at work, until school starts." 15 years of addiction.	0
What has changed since you went from "girlfriend" to "wife"?	Other people seem to take our relationship more seriously and have more respect for it, whether it be friends/family or random people who may hit on either one of us. I've never met a guy who cared when I've told him I have a boyfriend but they tend to back off when I tell them I'm married. Plus, I know it's stupid, but I feel a little more special and confident in our relationship. I like being introduced as his wife rather than his girlfriend...oh and I also like being covered on his health insurance lol	Absolutely nothing. We got married in January for insurance purposes, had been together for nearly nine years, and had lived together for about six. Everything is the same, except that our relationship is just like everyone else's now. I always kind of preferred not being married. I felt like it was special to have such a strong relationship that the government didn't have their fingers in.	1
For those of you have siblings, how often do you talk to them?	Talk... once or twice a week. However... we email each other every day. My sister (64) and I (61) are both retired, happily single and live alone, about 2 miles apart. Our morning emails are to connect and make sure we're both alive and not lying unconscious on the bathroom floor or whatever. Touching base with a sentence or two is a nice way to start off each day. We play Scrabble once a week (winters in my condo, summers on her back deck) so we catch up on all the details then.	I have two older brothers, I typically hear from one of them on major holidays like Christmas or when he wants something. The other is 20 years older and I don't really talk to him, I might exchange words once every two years? Sucks because I have five nieces, one great nieces and a great nephew and I would love to know them but I don't get that opportunity :(	1
Broken after a breakup: what are your self-care tips?	put on your favorite outfit and leave your house. get your best girlfriend, your best gay friend, or mom/aunt whatever and do something fun out in the world. take notice of how the world reacts to you as an individual (not just how men react to you physically but people as a whole)--this will help boost your confidence and remember your number one priority: you!	Allow yourself some time to feel all of it. Importantly, be kind to yourself - if you want to cry, cry. There were many days I snuck into the bathroom at work to let the tears flow. But keep pulling yourself back up and together! For me, the gym provided great outlet for all of these overwhelming emotions. I ran and lifted a lot. I rediscovered yoga and meditation that gave me positive vibes. I also Netflix binged on all sorts of mindless shows - Gilmore Girls, Drop Dead Diva, Love, etc. I learned to cook all kind of different dishes. I went to cooking classes with my sister. I made more effort to see my friends who were incredibly supportive. A quote that I found really helpful: "Life is constantly moving, and the best thing to do is to move forward with it." Hugs.	0
What are some boundaries you have in place in your relationships (romantic or otherwise), and how do you enforce them?	Sex is for mutual pleasure. I will not be harmed for someone else's pleasure. And if we're going to test limits, reciprocity is expected.	I don't really know where to start, I have boundaries in all of my relationships. I "enforce" them (strong word) by not allowing/engaging in behaviour that crosses my boundaries. I know that sounds really vague but I'm not totally sure where to go without being really specific.	1
What is something about yourself that makes you a great partner? What is something about you that makes you a challenging partner?	Great: I make amazing baked goods. Also super loyal. Challenging: When my anxiety gets the best of me. I know I can't be logical at those times and it is a huge challenge for my SO	Great: I am really laid back and I'm usually down for anything and everything. I like trying new things and going new places. I love sex and initiate the majority of the time. I'm a great travel buddy. Communication is important to me. Challenging: I call people out on their shit and people don't always like that. I can be stubborn.	1
Older women of Reddit: what kind of things have you noticed happening with your body/mind/spirit as you've aged that no one told you about when you were younger?	That you continue to grow and be challenged in all these areas. Everyone talked about "when you grow up..." as if it were a place, an age, a mind state. What they didn't ever talk about was the continual challenges personally, emotionally, spiritually, etc. The challenges that continue to happen and how its is relevant to our life as a whole. They didn't mention how we have to challenge our bodies for continual growth either. In sum, lifelong growth was never mentioned.	I posted this elsewhere, but I felt like I should share. The treatment many women are reporting in their forties are the same way I've ALWAYS been treated as an overweight woman. Welcome to Club Invisible. So glad you finally arrived.	1
What's making you unhappy in your current relationship?	Our baby is 5 months old. Our sex life is non existent. My vagina still hurts terribly and it's making me unhappy. My clitoris tore as well, so it's been quite a ride... Lack of sleep makes me angry and we both are stressed out and snap easily, but we are working on it. I never thought having a baby would be this hard.	Only that my husband is very unhappy and stressed at work and I hate seeing him so deflated and upset. I know that I can cheer him up short-term by cooking him his favourite food, cuddling him and listening to him talk, but the fact that I can't do more makes me sad.	0
What food item(s) do you consider to be vastly overrated to the point of almost making you angry like who the fuck thought this would taste good and why do people keep eating it?	Those Starbucks coffee milkshakes. Granted, I've never actually had one, but everything about them repulses me and I can't understand why they're so popular. Just the thought of drinking one makes my teeth feel rotten.	I hate ranch. It doesn't bother me that other people like it, but it does bother me when people seem convinced that if I just tried it ONE MORE TIME, I would like it. Also, my boyfriend loves kombucha and I swear he's made me try like 6 or 7 different brands. I JUST DON'T LIKE IT, BABE.	0
What's the dumbest thing you've ever done while intoxicated that could have ended very badly, but thankfully didn't?	I got so drunk that I fully passed out on the toilet in the bar bathroom. I am absolutely horrified by the memory, and thank the freaking lord one of the girls in my group absolutely insisted on finding me before she was willing to go home. There's no real excuse, people were buying me drinks that night, and I didn't really think about how much I was consuming. It's been about 4 years, and I have never gotten even close to that drunk since	While not a woman, about the dumbest thing I've witnessed. I was working as a line cook at a well known college bar and closed at 1am but left closer to 1:30. It was snowing heavily (being February in Colorado) and I took my mom's SUV to work since my parents were out of town. These two petite women approach me while I'm cleaning snow off the windshield asking me for a ride home miles away. They were very clearly drunk. It blew my mind! I was an athletic 6'2" and I'm the one you all for a ride? Of course I drove them home. Found out later they were roommates with a busser at my restaurant. She thanked me later and said they're kind of stupid that way. :/	1
Hi all, could you tell us a funny story from your life please?	One time when I was little I woke up screaming, and my mom of course came running to see what happened. I told her I had a nightmare and she asked me what it was about, and I said "Sissy took my cereal!!!" So that was my true fear. Having my cereal taken from me.	Not so funny but I have to share: Yoko Ono walked right fucking past me 2 days ago but I didn't see her :(((	1
Is modern dating that bad? Or it is just Reddit?	I was dating in my late 20's and had a great time! I am so so so grateful for the internet, where you can pretty much disclose your deal breakers and preferences upfront. It made things really easy and enjoyable for me, and I didn't waste anyone's time, disclosed that I wanted marriage and not just dating for years, so all the biggies were there upfront, which I'm happy about	Yes, it's horrible for women. We just don't have any quality options. It's better to remain single than deal with trash options, imo.	1
Women who have masculine features (eg. broad shoulders, tall stature etc.), how do you deal with self acceptance/confidence?	I'm 5'10 and built like a linebacker. I will never be delicate or dainty. But I love how big and solid I am. I am a very formidable presence. Growing up it wasn't easy. I've been this tall since I was 12-13. Lot of mean comments. But it's the only body I've got and it's trying it's best.	Well I'm aMab and I feel like the ideal way I want to look and present myself as Is impossible as it would require them I feel well ever be feasible to do. But beyond that, I still present as male, which sucks because I feel like I don't count as trans. Since I'm neither suffering outwardly from my identity, or being treated as being trans, it feels like people just think I'm just saying I'm trans for the social capital and in order to fit in and I don't have any claim to it because I'm not giving anything up. I'm also terrified that that's indeed the case and I'm just a selfish bigoted fake. I have issues around this stuff	1
Women who've dated both men and women, do you feel the beauty expectations were different? If so, how?	Guy here. I like my women shaved as well, but would not go so far to downright demand it from them. My current girlfriend always rants about how she needs to shave again and doesn't really want to (because lots of effort). Even though i would prefer her shaved clean, i really don't mind if she doesn't shave for quite some time. Like most women, she has a very good hygiene and she'll shave anyways sometimes down the road. Sometimes she even points out her armpit hair and says "uh gross, i need to shave" and i'm like "ok?". It's weird to read how many guys demand freshly shaved bodies on a daily basis. I mean, i love my girlfriend - shaved or unshaved.	My sample size is too small, but I've been lucky. My boyfriend doesn't like body hair on me, but he doesn't like it on himself either. The woman I dated didn't care at all for either of us, which I liked because it mirrors how I feel. Neither gave a shit about makeup or hair stuff. I do think it's probably more common for men to expect things from women that they don't do for themselves than it is for a woman to expect it from another woman if she *herself* doesn't do it.	0
Ladies who chose the copper IUD: did your periods really get worse? How much worse?	After about 15 months my periods went from okay to awful. I became super bloated, like I couldn't button my pants, I was bleeding through a kotex super plus tampon in two hours or less. My cramps would make me nauseated and light headed. I had it removed after 18 months.	No, but I did get a baby cousin as a side effect of the copper IUD that my aunt wore! 😆	1
What hobby is welcoming and inclusive for beginners?	At least in my experience, pinball. There aren't that many people involved in it anyway, so they're very happy to welcome new people, and the more experienced players will give you helpful tutorials on scoring and basic flipper skills. They'll also often waive entry fees for new/novice players, so you won't have as much to lose!	Board games! There are games for all levels of players, and I find most gamers to be welcoming whether you're super nerdy into it or just casual.	0
Have you ever been to a Planned Parenthood? If so, what do they do?	In my case, they did a well-woman exam (breast exam and annual gynecological exam). They also renewed my birth control prescription at the time.	I went there to get a Plan B pill. They sold me one. The end. I can't tell you about everything else they do because I did not desire receiving every single service they provide.	1
What celebrity death has hit you the hardest?	Anton Yelchin, because he was so young and the way he died just seemed like the universe wanted to give the world another middle finger.	Zero! I couldn't care less about people I don't know and who don't know me. Actors and singers are all easily replaced by the next big thing, people move on and forget the dead entertainers.	1
What is pretty shitty to be judgmental about?	I judge people's education level. I shouldn't and admit I'm shitty for it, but if a person offers me an opinion or tries telling me how much they "know" about something, their education level plays on how quickly I dismiss it as something I should care about or not.	Anything a person can't change. I mean you can judge sure, it's in our nature, however don't go up to a girl with peach fuzz and say "girl what's with your mustache?"	0
Women who accidentally got pregnant, how did birth control go wrong?	Not me, but my sister got pregnant with an IUD perfectly in place. They didn't find any defects, it hadn't moved at all, the doctor said she was just "the 1%".	First time it was a batch of recalled birth control, 2nd time I had the flu and apparently if you throw up your birth control it doesn't work... ;) I wouldn't change either for anything though.	1
Women who have had plastic surgery for cosmetic reasons, what did you get done and why? How did it impact your life after? Do you regret anything?	When I was about 10, I had my ears surgically pinned back. It was my mother's decision, I didn't really have a say, but she hated how they stuck out (she later had my youngest sister have the procedure as well). It hasn't really impacted my life at all, and I think it's because I was so young, and too young to even have a complex about my ears. But I often wonder if I had never had the procedure when I did if I would have grown to be insecure about my ears later.	I got 8 moles removed about 2 months ago (I am a super moley person). I chose ones that either stuck out loads or were weird looking or a combo of both. Even though one turned into a keloid scar I'm happy I got it done, the one on my forehead was nicknamed 'mount Everest' by an imaginative boy at school. And I love to run my fingers over where they used to be and just feel flat skin, except the keloid scar but I'm using bio oil and it's still smaller than it was.	0
Have you ever met a famous person? What were they like? Were they down to earth, or super rude?	Amanda Bynes. Years ago when I was a teen. Before she had a decline. She saw me standing. Hoping for an autograph. I was too shy to ask. But she came up to me. Asked if I wanted one. Took pictures with me. And was super kind. It's sad she's had some issues lately. She was lovely when I met her.	Yeah, lots. They kinda ran the gamut, honestly. The one thing I did find is that the rudest or most pretentious people weren't the actually famous ones, it was the people who were more... fame-adjacent? Like they were almost famous but not quite. They had a much higher likelihood of being insufferable, I found. Like they were clinging so hard to the scrap of fame they had, that they needed to prove it to everyone else.	1
What is your biggest non-physical insecurity?	I worry that I'm boring. I'm not a super fun dance-y ball of sunshine exciting mysterious person like a lot of the women in my friend group are. I'm frightfully plain.	I lack a certain degree of warmth and social nuance and this can be off putting. It isn't uncommon for the least charitable interpretations of what I say to be favored if there is more than one way to interpret it, to extrapolate the complete opposite of what I actually meant. There is no fully coming back from being vilified, I am to some degree always a social leper. I am often left feeling like I am misinterpreting friendship for strained tolerance, and that I'm really viewed as irredeemable.	1
What basic behavior/etiquette standard are you shocked that you had to teach a grown-ass adult?	I had to teach my 34 year old husband how to set a table. He had no idea that forks go on the left, and spoons, knives and water glasses on the right. We're not even talking a fancy dinner setting, just your standard sitting down to Wednesday night dinner.	I was a manager at a fast food restaurant. There were several employees who didn't understand basic customer relations, like that if a customer asked, "How's it going?" they don't actually want to hear the terrible details of your life. I'm talking, "Oh, I had miscarriage yesterday so I've been bleeding a lot" or "My boyfriend has had diarrhea for days so he's been grumpy." Just... shit you do not share with a stranger, much less someone who is coming in to order food.	0
What's your weirdest menstruation story?	O_O;; *shudder* I hope all of the ladies in this thread never have to experience anything even approaching the severity of what's featured here.	Here's mine: I had a massive cold at the same time as my period. I sneezed, and my whole body contracted, which led to a large discharge of blood (even though I have my menstrual cup on). I was alone at home, and actually yelled to the walls "I HATE EVERYTHING!!!!"	0
What has been the most misogynistic thing you have experienced?	I was on the elliptical at the gym I used to go to. It was a very small community college gym - 3 treadmills, an elliptical, a bike, and one TV. I was the only person working out and there was a Yankees game on the TV. I love the Yankees - even spent my honeymoon at the Baseball Hall of Fame. So I was actually *watching* the game. A guy walked in and asked if he could change the station. I said no, I'm watching the game. He then said "yeah, right". I said "I'm a Yankees fan". He made a noise like "pfft" and said "ok, then name off all the players". I said ok and started naming off my favorites first - he interrupted me and said "those are just the *popular* players" and walked away.	Anytime I tell someone I'm not interested in marriage or children, they said you will give it time. No I'm pretty sure I won't be changing my mind now or ever	1
If you have been with your SO for over a decade, how has your relationship changed through the years?	My husband and I have been married for 10 years. We were together almost three years when we got married. What has changed? He came out as bisexual. I realized I identify as polyamorous and that monogamy leaves me feeling frustrated and dissatisfied. So now we have an open marriage. I've had another partner for almost 3 years, and my husband occasionally goes on dates.	Together 22 years this month. It's gotten better because we both know exactly who we are, together as a couple, and individually as people. We're stronger as a couple, because we can fix any issues as they pop up. We're having more fun than ever. The sex has never been better.	0
What are sexist or misogynistic things in society that people dismiss?	the mix of race with sexism on reddit, people are allowed to generalize about non white culture, but try to generalize about a white culture from POC POV, and you will get critisized to no end. Yeah Trump got elected, but you aren't white so you don't get be racist.	"Oh, their fans are all *teenage girls*" (implied; stupid, materialistic, unable to appreciate actual things or actually apply judgement to what they like) Actually was reading a really interesting article earlier that pointed out one reason some young girls idolize female pop singers and e.g. Disney Princesses is because they're some of the few characters or persons who are able to be feminine and still be at the center of their own story, the story revolving around them as the main character. That was eye-opening.	0
What is the most ridiculous thing a healthcare professional has told you?	Could not wrap her head around the fact that I was sexually active, wasn't trying to get pregnant, but wasn't on birth control. Knew I had a female partner. I mean...	Not me but my mom. She has hypothyroidism and has trouble losing weight and keeping it off. She went in to see a doctor before she was diagnosed with it and he told her "whatever you're eating, eat half of that. I guarantee you'll lose weight." Meanwhile she generally eats pretty healthy and about two meals a day. She does not overeat *at all.* She was too stunned to tell him to go fuck himself so she didn't. But if I were there I would be left and refused to pay for that "service."	1
What does child birth/being in labor feel like?	At first it was like bad menstrual cramps, then it progressed to something far more painful, as if my uterus was trying to escape my body. Then I had an epidural and slept through most of it feeling no pain.	Just remember as bad as it hurts our bodies where created to handle the pain and giving birth. Otherwise we would never have children after the first one. It's honestly different pain for everyone and every pregnancy. I'd say cramps and back pain are probably the most common symptoms. The good news is that they have drugs that they can give you at a certain point to ease the pain. They don't work correctly all the time but do most of the time. The end result is definitely worth the work. :)	1
What was your, "Oh... apparently that's a dealbreaker for me" moment?	He wore the same pair of Dockers to our 4 dates. The guy made good money, and was decent looking. But, dude, put some effort into it. I also found out he coveted Lego sets. He was 37...	Family money. Money sounds great right? Until you're an adult and you have to ask for it because you've never had to work. I never thought I'd grow to hate the idea of dating a man with money but it turned out he didn't have any freedom at all. He scoffed at minimum wage but had to ask for gas money.	0
Mothers, what did you do to maintain your sanity in the first few weeks or months after having a baby?	I cried the first three weeks after my first child was born, but only if I was alone with him. So I spoke to a co-worker once a day and she let me cry or talk or she'd share parenting advice. I also made a habit and got into a routine. So Ellen came on, and would start dancing. So if dance with my little one in my arms. After those three weeks, hormones started to even out :)	Realize that you can take the baby with you almost anywhere. Most people have had kids and won't be bothered if the baby cries. And if they are bothered, f*ck 'em. When I started getting out of the house, even to do silly things like get the car detailed or go to the library, I felt so much better. Having a little baby doesn't mean you're trapped in the house.	1
People who have been very poor: what is something you've done to get by that impressed even you as a new ''low''?	When my family was homeless, people would give us t-shirts, pants, etc. But we couldn't afford underwear, so we didn't have it. For over a year. Once my dad got a job, he and mom took the whole family to buy underwear - every single one of us was so excited! It's such a silly thing, but it's stuck with me, and to this day wearing pretty, comfy panties is a luxury I treasure. Having nice undies means everything is okay.	When I was in college I would take cash withdrawals from my visa (which my dad paid). There was like an immediate 20% interest. I did it anyways. I felt very poor, even though, I wasn't.	1
What are the dumbest/worst things you've heard someone say "It means she wants to have sex" about?	The thing about matching underwear. Some people just like wearing matching underwear, it doesn't mean they're planning anything and even then you might change your mind later.	If her shoe is hanging off her foot it means she's cool and relaxed and up for a good time...... ... You'd be surprised how well this actually works at a bar I've tried it and holy shit it's like some secret man trigger.	1
Single ladies: What is your monthly salary? Do you feel like you can live comfortably on it?	I am "single" in marriage terms but live with my boyfriend. I am a teacher and barely make ends meet with splitting bills with him. I would not be able to afford to live on my own with my current student loan payments, car payments and shitty paychecks. I do not live in an expensive city. We have very affordable housing here. Idk how some women do it either.	I earn $3kish a month. I have side gigs so my monthly income is variable between $3k and $4k. Honestly, I have an easier time meeting my budget when single than when in a relationship. In a relationship, there is a lot more entertainment spending and spending to indicate fondness that you simply don't have to do when single. No date nights. No Netflix subscription. And no one else's spending habits to compromise to humor.	0
I see a lot of posts about bad/creepy interactions with guys. What are your positive/good interactions with them?	Most of my interactions with men are positive and respectful. I have several lovely male coworkers, a lot of my close friends are guys, my neighbors are wonderful, most of my contact with men I do not already know - polite and pleasant. At least 95% of my interactions with men are nice, or at the minimum neutral. For me, it is just that the smaller number of unpleasant encounters stand out more for both their relative rarity and negative impact.	One time I was carrying a package into the post office and there were two sets of doors. 4 different guys held the door open for me coming in and out!!! I never even had to touch the door! I felt like such a woman.	1
Grabbed from AskMen: Women, what moment do you look back on and can't believe how much of an idiot you were?	The fact that I chose to stay in America after graduating high school instead of taking the amazing opportunity to go to college in Scotland because I thought I was *~so in love~* with my boyfriend at the time and wanted to stay here with him. Yeah, that was stupid.	Starving myself in high school and freaking out about how I look constantly I barely wear makeup anymore and have definately on some weight (I used to have a BMI of 19-20 and now it's like 20-21). I can still sleep with pretty much whoever I want. Doing stuff because other people told me to do it. Or it "should be good" instead of thinking for myself. Having sex with guys because I was afraid they'd leave me or assault me if I didn't.	1
Those who have ended a close friendship, what's the story behind it? Was it a difficult decision for you?	She got depressed and stopped talking to me. I would always talk to her like normal and invite her to do stuff which she would always say no to. I didn't mind because she was depressed, until I saw she was always talking to her other friends and going out with them all the time when she said she was going to be in bed (who also happen to be people who hate me for a misunderstanding I could never clear up) and I was like "well fuck you then".	She came to visit after I had lost a lot of weight due to an eating disorder. She expressed shock, worry, and anger, which I understood. What I didn't understand was the cops showing up at my door later that day for a wellness check. She had lied to them to get them to come out and "scare me straight". Possibly even hoping they would cart me off to a mental hospital. It was so violating.	1
What male character in tv or film is obviously a female fantasy?	I don't necessarily think he was intended to be, but Jack Dawson from Titanic. A free spirited, open-minded, heroic and romantic artist who would do anything, including die, for his true love.	I don't know if it counts since the author is a guy, but tons of ASOIAF characters fall under this category. Example: Jon Snow	1
WOC, if you are white-passing, how do you feel about that?	I'm from ex Yugoslavia and have dark hair and dark eyes. I live in Norway where most people are blond haired and blue eyed. I don't pass as a norwegian and people often ask me about my heritage, because I look very much East european.	I always found the College Humour"Are you Asian Enough" video to be spot on in how exhausting it can be to exist in the space that isn't "enough" of either. In Canada I'm the normal girl until someone finds out about my ancestry (then I'm Asian chick even though I don't look any different), in Japan I'm that white girl who isn't Japanese enough.	0
What do you wish more guys knew?	Quit beating around the bush, man. Seriously. I know a lot of girls enjoy the subtle flirting shit, but listen. I am *not in tune with my own attractiveness.* if you want me to suck your dick, **ask me to suck your dick.** I'll probably say no, because I'm gay. But if you never actually tell me you intend to have sex with me, I am **going** to assume were bros and be even *more* freaked out when you make a move. I'm gay. I'm not gonna blow you. Now do you wanna play video games or not? (Note: also applies to women. If you want me to blow you, please just ask. I'm as thirsty as a twelve year old white boy.)	I think the secret to getting laid well and often is being emotionally forthcoming and available. Especially in a relationship. Women need to feel safe to have sex with you. If you've been lying about weird shit (things that seem like they don't matter) and avoid talking things out, you're making yourself unavailable to fuck her later. HEED ME	0
What are your favorite movies about women?	Girl with the dragon tattoo series, the newest Mad Max has a female co-star Are there really not many movies that feature women? Seems like an equal amount to me.	A League of Their Own, Little Women, Now and Then, Million Dollar Baby, Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Help, Thelma and Louise, Girl Interrupted, Mean Girls, Clueless, Frozen	0
It seems like women are shamed for wanting children or not wanting children, by both men and women. Why can't we just be ok with other people's life choices?	How do women shame other women for wanting children? Edit: This is a sincere question. I'm not denying it happens, but am genuinely curious what it looks like when it happens, because my own experience is that our society tends to be very enthusiastic/supportive/celebrating around having children.	Some people feel threatened or judged when other people choose different life paths. It happens for far more than the question of having children. I think it is just a feature of some humans to feel like people making different choices than themselves are automatically judging or disapproving of them, so they reflect that assumed negativity back into the world. Or maybe they have very strict beliefs on what constitutes a "right" life and just can't handle when people make other choices. It's just something that happens with humans in my experience. The focus topic changes but the outlook doesn't.	0
Ladies who use Tinder, how did you react when your date looked WAY different in person? Did you still enjoy your time?	He had straight up used someone else's photos. When he approached me in the coffee shop after I got over the initial shock of him being significantly older, significantly shorter, significantly fatter and a different ethnicity I literally walked out without saying a word. He tried to chase after me and then berated me by text. I told him he could fuck right off and since I knew where he worked because he had used his work number to call me I threatened to call the police if he ever contacted me again. I have no interest in being catfished.	Was another dating site but he turned out to be gay (I think). he spoke in a stereotypically feminine manner complete with wrist flicking. The date consisted of him talking about his "preggo" friends baby shower and how he bakes cake pops in his free time. He also talked about teaching his male friends about fashion and how to do housework. I think he asked me a couple of questions about myself at some point. He gave me the wrong address at first too and then i locked myself out of my car when i finally got there. Worst date ever.	1
Women who eat organic, gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, keto, etc. What health benefits have you noticed and is it expensive to maintain that lifestyle?	My husband and I eat keto diets. We've had a lot of great results in terms of mental and physical health, including increased energy and decreased weight. It doesn't cost more than our old habits. We eat a lot of keto-friendly vegetables and fruit, meats, and cheeses. At first, I thought i was going to miss bread terribly, but it hasn't been bad and we make keto-approved bread when we really want something cake/bread-like. We both actually eat much healthier in general on keto than we did before. Dinner is usually a serving of meat, couple of servings of vegetables, and ice water. It works well for us.	I'm vegetarian and I went vegan/gluten-free/sugar-free/the-worst-diet-ever for about a month because I had an unknown allergy. Going vegetarian, I saved money and lost weight. Fast food is less often an option, even more so when you're vegan. You're also forced to be a bit more creative and learn more cooking. So, naturally, I eat healthier. I feel better, too. The biggest expense is fresh veggies and fruit. I buy frozen a lot, and buy whatever is in season and cheap for the rest. Eating out can be a challenge, but it's good for your wallet and waistline if you don't do it too often. You also get preached at a lot. People care about your health and diet.	0
What's the pettiest way you've gotten back at a roommate?	The guy has kids over 10 and in no way can any other neighbor hear our music. When the guy threatens to kick your ass, on multiple occasions clearly he's not thinking straight. One day he was pulling out of our shared driveway, saw we were getting home and stops his car. He gets out barges in our home and threatens us, while leaving his wife and kids in the car. What kind of man does that? Sure it's not fair to his kids but this is just one of our more passive ways to get back at this douche.	I have a roommate who never cleans... ever. He has a body wash that stains the bathtub with a gross residue so sometimes when I see a puddle of it when I'm taking a shower I'll take his bath scrubber loofa thing and clean the bathtub with it using my foot as I'm standing there showering.	0
CNN just fired comedian Kathy Griffin for her "anti-Trump" photo shoot. Do you believe she deserved to be fired? Did she go too far? Or are public figures fair game for just about anything?	It's not the fact that it's Trump's head that pisses me off it's he fact that it was a recreation of an ISIS photo. Completely insensitive and too far. Should she be persecuted for it by the government? No. Freedom of speech. But that doesn't mean CNN doesn't have the right to fire her.	I thought it was pretty fucking funny, but I can see why CNN wouldn't want to be associated with it.	1
X-post from /r/askmen - What trait did one of your exes have that is now a dealbreaker for future relationships?	"Well the wage gap" If the next words aren't "is made up" Bye bye. Actually any of that sort of feminist rhetoric can go away.	Refusing to hold my hand in public. It wasn't because he didn't like PDA. It was because he didn't want people to know we were together.	0
Single ladies of Reddit, what is the loneliest thing you've ever done?	I slept on my sofa during a breakup because when you have your back to the sofa back, it feels like someone else is there	Woken up on my own. My boyfriend didn't come home last night. He went out for a few drinks and he probably thought he was being helpful (I have work this morning) by crashing at a friends house rather than wake me up. But waking up on my own, with no text to let me know he's safe, has made me feel insignificant and worried.	1
What's your favorite healthy snack?	I eat lots of raw fruits and veggies. Generally apples and bananas for fruit and carrots or cucumbers for vegetables. I don't use dressing, but if I do, it's balsamic vinegar or hummus. If I'm a little more hungry, I like to have yogurt (plain, no flavours or sugar), or salsa and lettuce.	Air popped popcorn. No added oil or butter. Although I usually cook it on the stove with a little olive oil because it tastes so good. Great for when I'm craving salty carbs because it's fewer calories than any bread, bagels, crackers, chips, cereal, etc.	0
What are some of the absent-minded things you do?	Forget what I'm doing in the middle of a task and spend several moments just stranding there staring into space. It's like I'm a sim and someone just cancelled my action.	Pick at the skin along my finger nails, make that ridiculous "duck lips" face to make sure my septum jewelry is straight, run my hands over my head, check my phone.	1
What is the most misunderstood part about your job?	I don't have a "real" job. I'm a stay at home mom. Obviously, everyone just assumes I sit around all day. Sure, there are days where I actually do but it's not like anyone else works 24/7... I get "I wish I could stay at home every day! Must be nice" type of comments a lot. It's just really ignorant and demeaning to have everyone assume you do nothing. I take care of my family...I'm my daughters teacher. I'm everyones cook and maid. Sometimes I feel like I forget what it's like to interact with adults. Have real conversations that don't involve animals, colors, or the abc's. That's the hardest part for most people but I don't mind too much. No, my job isn't hard but it's not lounging around eating snacks and binge watching tv all day.	Pathologists are indeed doctors. Autopsy is nothing like CSI, Bones, Investigative Discoveries or whatever other crime show you've seen on TV.?	0
Women who have been shot and also given birth, which is worse and why?	In terms of physical discomfort, my emergency c-section didn't even rate in my top 5 worst pain. Hooray for spinal anesthetic? Worst pain I've personally experienced was when I had to rinse my mouth with Listerine after getting my tongue pierced.	My mother had an accident hiking that resulted in an open fractured femur and a shattered pelvis. Keep in mind that she was in the woods and help didn't reach her for several hours while she was fully conscious. She said the pain didn't compare to giving birth naturally to twins.	0
When do you think you are most misunderstood being a women?	When I'm at the doctor's office trying to make my problems clear and my doctor decides that their education and cursory look at my body means I'm wrong.	People think I can't do something because I'm small. When I take initiative and do something responsible, I get looked at like "aww isn't it cute that it thinks it's people". I get looked at like I'm a baby bunny in a suit. I'm sick of it. I get that you can't tell by looking at a person, but don't assume that I'm incompetent.	0
What's an opinion of yours that you want challenged?	llegal immigration is completely wrong and disrespectful to legal immigrants like me who either waited a long time or acquired useful skills to immigrate. Illegal immigrants should be deported if they're not in danger and are simply economic migrants.	Some families aren't meant to last a lifetime. I believe that it's healthy to break up with your family if they're toxic, just as it's healthy to leave a toxic partner.	0
Have you ever issued an 'ultimatum' to your partner, that if it wasn't met you'd break up? What was the ultimatum and did they follow through?	Usually if you are open and communicate your issues, an ultimatum shouldn't be necessary. If they are openly going against something you feel very strongly about, an ultimatum wouldn't help anyhow. If you do draw a line, be sure you are willing to follow through when it is crossed. Good luck	Booze or me. He chose me and hasn't had a drink since. That was *years* ago. I will say that I had already begun to make plans to leave if he chose the booze, so it wasn't an empty threat. We just celebrated our 34th wedding anniversary and are very close. I'm grateful he chose me, it would have been sad to miss out on my relationship with this wonderful man.	0
What's your take-to-the-grave secret that's actually really bad?	One of my best friends' husband got drunk and hit on me. They've been together for 12 years, I didn't have the guts to tell anyone.	I made fake dating profiles of the girl my ex cheated on me with and left me for so that she would get harassed. I put all of her contact information in the profile so people would bother her.	1
Ladies of Reddit, what's a douchey thing that guys do but we don't realize we are doing it?	Complimenting me by putting down other women. Especially if it's by putting down *all other women*. Dude I can guarantee that I am not the ONLY woman who [anything].	Singing 'girly' karaoke songs as a joke. It's not funny when women sing songs written by men and it's sexist and "douchey" to think it's funny in reverse. "So I put my hands up they're playing my song"	1
What is the rudest/most unprofessional thing that has happened to you in an interview?	A few years ago, I spent an hour at a coffee shop consulting with a potential client for a photography job. She wanted her fashion line photographed editorial style. It was a pretty intense gig and involved a lot of hours and commercial use licensing. Went over business plans, locations, potential models, etc. At the end of the "interview" she says to me, "So, I have this thing where I don't pay people the first time they work for me.. But this will be great exposure for you!" Completely wasted my time and hers. For the sake of context, the words, "I can't pay, but it will be good exposure for you," are some of the most disrespectful words you can say to someone in the art world.	So, I haven't had anything bad happen to me and usually avoid answering as I'm not a woman. However my SO has had some Awful interviews. The worst was someone called her asking about an interview. He said to meet in the pub 'the red lion' Now my SO had been out of work for a while, and figured it would be for a waitress or bartender at the red lion. She gets there. and nope. someone hiring strippers, pretending to be the pub on websites, and just meeting them there with a drink. Then proceeded to tell her she could be an escort but she was to fat to be a stripper.	1
What is the most ridiculous thing a man (or woman) has done to try to get you in bed?	Honestly, I just find negging the most ridiculous thing in the world as an attempt to get a woman into bed or interested in any way. I could never make someone I like (or someone I'm completely apathetic to for that matter) feel bad about themselves. I would feel just awful. And to use that as a way to win them over with manipulation just leaves me wondering if people who do it have any respect for women at all or if they've ever actually felt love and how nice it is to treat someone well.	I've had girls try to physically force themselves on me a few times. They were always drunk, and they were probably used to being able to fuck anyone they throw themselves at, so I'm not sure I can blame them much. Interesting how that is amusing to me, where if I was a woman it would surely be terrifying.	1
Mothers of AW, what's the last thing your child said/did, that made you say "yup, that's my girl/boy"?	It's a weird experience to be a parent. To have this life that you love so much and that pride pours out of you at the littlest experiences. My son is 3 years old and here are a few recent instances: -He wrote his name for the first time! -Watching him do summersaults and balance beam and follow directions at gymnastics class. -He potty trained himself this summer. Pride is something you feel for your children on an almost daily basis, at least when they are young! They are learning and growing so much, that watching them roll over for the first times makes pride swell.	I randomly get Snapchat selfy videos from my daughter with wacky overlay graphics. This causes me to roll my eyes and laugh out loud, which of course is why she does it. She's in her 30's.	0
What’s the luckiest thing that’s ever happened to you?	I was at a mall and heard a woman scream from the upper level. I turned around, looked up....and reflexively caught a toddler who had somehow managed to squeeze between the iron safety rails and fallen literally on top of me, a good 20-25 feet below. Perfect catch, not a scratch. I've replayed this in my head dozens of time and still to this day do not know how the hell I did this.	You're clearly feeling generous, OP. Why don't you tell us the luckiest thing that's happened to you? Hit the jackpot and decided to make it rain?	1
What are the early signs of a one sided relationship?	I feel sad that this question had to be asked. I will admit to being in bad relationships but I always knew it and wanted something physical anyway so for those cases relax and enjoy the fireworks in bed. If you want more and have a bad feeling you know what to do but are not willing to end it. That is all you if you know and continue anyway. You do know, it is that simple.	The other party puts in the bare minimum of effort. You're always going over to *their* place, they never bother to come to yours. Or when you want to see them/talk to them, they don't text you back... they only want to interact with you when they don't have anything 'better' to do.	0
What type of diet makes your body feel the best?	I feel best doing intermittent fasting and eating basically the opposite of vegan, so I eat nothing all day (though I do drink a cup of coffee with cream in the morning and stuff like Powerade zero throughout the day) and then eat like a whole rotisserie chicken or a pound of sausage for dinner. I don't know how to explain it really, but I hate the way it feels digesting things, so I limit that unpleasant sensation to once a day. Also carbs make me really moody from all the blood sugar spikes and drops, so I mostly avoid those, though I'm not keto-strict.	I took 9 months off drinking alcohol entirely and I'd never felt better. I slept better, my skin looked better, I'd lost a few lbs (not intentional, but hey, I"ll take it), my overall *well being* was better. dunno why I stopped stopping tbh.	0
What do men unintentionally say to you that they don't think is sexist but is?	When a guy finds out I'm in a relationship and he says "oh, he's sure a lucky guy". This especially annoys me because why can't I be the lucky one, as I actually feel I am? If it's a good relationship, which it is, my boyfriend and I should both feel equally lucky. And I do feel that way. To a lesser degree, it also annoys me because I'm bisexual and actually have a boyfriend and a girlfriend right now. I know that's too complicated for many to explain that to, but I don't think any guy as ever approached me and even considered the option I may be in a relationship with a woman. I'm not seeking attention that way, but it does bother me at times when everyone assumes you only are attracted to men.	I work in a male dominated industry and get a lot of comments from male coworkers about how surprised they are that I "turned out to be" so smart/competent/authoritative/professional etc. after they've gotten to know me. I let it slide because I know they mean well and they're not the most socially capable group of dudes but WOW talk about a backhanded compliment! I've also found that when I'm the only woman in a work group or area, I'm constantly asked how to fax things, reserve a conference room, to organize a potluck, etc. I'm not the Office Administrator and I'm definitely not your mommy.	0
Aside from "live, laugh, love", what decor trends or items are you not a fan of?	"In this house, we do ____." List of fourteen obvious things any decent person would do. Where did this thing even get started?	"Respect everyone" or "live and let live" Now, in *general*, this is absolutely amazing advice when it applies to non-harmful cultural differences or whatever; however, I've seen it creep into safety vs. feelings* and people are saying it if someone's racist or sexist. In that case, no, absolutely not, fuck them. I will not respect bigots, thanks. ----- When I say "safety vs feelings", I mean something like "a trans person's safety versus a cis person's feelings". You could replace "trans" with any other marginalized group (POC, woman/femme, etc) and "cis" with any oppressor group (white, man, etc). ----- eta: this example is peak liberalism, tbh (and being the leftist i am, it is unacceptable to put "feelings" [bigotry] above the safety and well-being of others)	1
Thoughts on taking your SO's last name for marriage?	I took my husband's last name. I guess it depends on the amount of attachment that you have to your maiden name. On another note, my sister-in-law recently got married and her husband took her last name, instead of her taking his. Now that's weird to me.	I don't think I would, unless their name is a lot cooler than mine. If I marry my current SO, we did have a pretty awesome idea. We both have the same middle name, so we thought it'd be cool for us both to switch our middle and last names. So in that case, we'd have the same last name, but we'd keep all 3 names given to us at birth (just a different order). That seems confusing so here's a (made-up) example. My name: Jordan Carter Wright SO's name: Lucy Carter Brown New names: Jordan Wright Carter and Lucy Brown Carter	0
What is a fine line that society expects women to tread?	Wear makeup to prevent yourself looking tired or ill, but not so much that guys notice or it's trashy. Dress to impress but don't do some silly shit like showing your legs and cleavage at the same time or you're just a slag who wants attention.	As a man, I'm expected to know where assertiveness ends and aggressiveness begins and avoid the latter, but all too often, when I'm in the thick of it, I occasionally slip up and say things that some would consider overbearing or overly demanding when I'm just trying to be direct. I'm just wondering what fine lines there are for women to navigate.	1
What's the pettiest reason you've dumped someone?	He said "touche" the way we now say "lol". Like it was just a meaningless filler word used to respond to anything. "I'm not coming over tonight" "touche". "Grab me a beer and I'll be there in ten" "touche". I'm not even an English snob. I don't correct other people when they use the wrong "to" or anything. But that shit made me insane. He was also a late 30s barfly/bouncer still living with multiple roommates and dating 19 year olds, but it was the touche that led to the breakup.	Two months into dating, we went to see a movie. I bought a large soda to share and a large popcorn for him because I said I didn't want any. Throughout the whole movie he hogged the drink and didn't offer any popcorn. Stopped seeing him after that.	1
Women of colour, what are your experiences with being fetishised?	Not me, but my best friend is Asian and over the years I have watched her date guys with Asian fetishes. I think it's super weird and I always wonder if she knows, but at the same time I don't want to bring it up. She's an amazing person, but sometimes I wonder if that guy who just happens to be minoring in Chinese is there for her or for his fetish.	Because of some weird genetic stuff with distant ancestors, I look as though I have East Asian heritage, though I have zero East Asian heritage. The things guys say to me! Greeting me with "Ni hao" or "Konnichiwa" or "love you long time" or whatever... telling me that Asian women are better girlfriends, so docile, that they're "tighter" or whatnot. Boggles my mind. I do get a sense of small justice whenever I tell them I'm actually of Native origin, and seeing the looks on their faces as they realized they dug themselves into a shitty racist hole. :) Like, "where are you from?" Me: America. Asshole: So where is your family from? When did they come to the US? Me: On the Bering Strait, most likely. This has never happened with women I've dated. Just men.	0
Let's get personal. What has been the worst event that has occurred in your life and how have you dealt with it?	My divorce from my 16yr marriage was finalized in Sept of 2016, I essentially had a nervous breakdown that Christmas because I had nobody to spend it with. I made amends with my parents January 1st 2017. My son's cat then got hit right in front of me about 10pm Jan 2nd. My employee called me the morning of Jan 3rd to tell me he totaled my 2016 Charger RT-Max and left the scene. My dad then died 1yr ago today, as I held his hand in his hospital room, I watched him take his last breath and his eyes turn gray. It was by far the worst 9 months of my life. Shout out to my counselor, psychologist and anti-depressants that have helped me the past year.	Probably the year span when my dad (55) died in a plane crash, and then 10 months later my mom (52) got diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer and then died within a week of the one year anniversary of my dad dying. I now call that week in July death week. Obviously very sad, lots of grief and mourning. It'll be 10 yrs from my dad's death this year. It doesn't really affect my daily life any more. I still miss them, but I have moved on and can enjoy life again.	0
Women of Reddit, what was/is it like being least physically attractive member of your friend group?	It's a bit like being punched in the gut. You know, logically, that it shouldn't hurt as much as it does, and your worth as a person doesn't revolve around people wanting to fuck you, and it isn't their fault that they get so much more attention and people like them better and everything always works out for them, but it sucks. It just sucks. I've known since I was a little girl. I don't know how much of it has to do with race (I grew up as one of the only black people in a mostly white area), but it's always been the case. I fixed it myself. Can't feel bad about being the ugliest friend if you haven't got any friends.	Not something I would ever think about. Of course my friend group is all dudes. But I've never compared myself to other people physically.	1
What are your pettiest life-hacks?	I had a friend who was late to everything. We just started telling her things started an hour earlier than they did. Worked like a charm.	I don't have the manual for my router, but I want to prioritize my Wii U's traffic over everyone else's so that my game of Mario Kart 8/the YouTube app doesn't crash due to a spotty connection.	1
Ladies who enjoy casual sex, what health care and safety measures do you take?	Always, always use condoms. And I've had a tubal ligation for birth control. Trust your gut for safety about going home with someone. Don't drink too much.	I use condoms for my less frequent partners. For my other very frequent partner, we don't. We're both clean and it would be a massive pain in the ass to use condoms because we stop and I suck his dick four or five times per session. I'm also on the pill and am super careful with taking it correctly.	1
Those who work full time and own a dog, what has your experience been?	I give my guy a big walk in the morning, but otherwise I think he is such a creature of habit he can't wait for me to be gone. I watch him through the blinds (cause I'm a creeper mom) and the *second* he hears that lock click, he turns around and jaunts straight to the couch. He's a Boston Terrier In the summer, we can sleep in (I am a teacher) but I still have to drag his bootie out of bed. Find the right dog and he'll be fine.	It's been fine but you need to be fair to the dog. To me that means a walk or run before work and long walks and play time after work every day, trips to the park, etc. A bored dog can be a destructive dog, especially if it lacks exercise and mental stimulation. I wouldn't get one if you're going to kennel them all day and then at night. No dog should live in a cage for 1/2 it's life for a person's convenience.	0
What are some tangible ways you reduced your emotional labour workload? What were the results, and how do you feel?	I've been trying to do this with my writing group. I'm in a fiction writing group that meets in rooms that need to be reserved at the library. Eventually I realized that, as the only woman, the men in the group kind of expected me to set up the appointments, get the rooms ready, etc. I'm trying to avoid this emotional /mental labor of organization by stopping setting this up but they still expect me to do it. I'm trying to figure out a way to straight up tell them to figure it out or do a rotation etc.	Getting out of retail helped immensely, no need to play that game when you're not expected to put on the happy face to help customers. I absolutely refuse to go into anything similar once I finish my degree, I'm planning on doing more consulting than customer service If you're talking about this new definition of 'emotional labour' aka taking care of family and sharing the domestic workload, well, I just don't choose men who can't take care of themselves. Why would I ever let myself get into that situation in the first place?	1
Do people on Reddit typically assume you're a man? How do you respond?	It's sort of my fault since I picked a really lame username...my fiancé dared me to do it and I didn't realize I couldn't change it later on. I haven't responded yet since I haven't come across anything too out there.	Yea I got called a white knight. I asked if I was still white knighting if I was a woman. Never got an answer so I still don't know	0
Ladies of Reddit, how did you know that your SO was it for you?	I'm an introvert. I need time alone to recharge or I break down. He doesn't drain me, I find him completely restful to be around, I could spend all day every day with him and not need a break, we just click.	My daughter from a previous realtionship was at a sleep over and we had a kid free night. We had some friends over for dinner and drinks. I drank too much wine and got sick and sloppy drunk. I ended up throwing up in the shower. It was bad. He cleaned everything up and took care of my stupid ass. Husband material right there.	1
What's your go-to healthy breakfast?	I'm a big overnight oats person. Oats, yogurt/milk (I usually use almond because I'm sensitive to dairy) then a little maple syrup, fruit, cinnamon. Yum.	[The Budwig diet] (www.budwigcenter.com/the-budwig-diet/#.WVvq86dNfYU) On top I sprinkle a spoonful of bee pollen and two spoons of flax seed. When in the mood I add fruit. The Budwig mixture is for cancer patients but it is said to bring oxygen into the cells of your body. It has made my eczema disappear. The bee-pollen I eat because it tastes like the origins of honey and the image of bees flying around with the little bags of goody two shoes goodness stuck to their cute little legs.	1
What is your funny or strange Pavlovian response?	I grew up going to a Mexican restaurant every Sunday. Now every time I pass a Spanish music channel on the radio, I crave chips and salsa.	If I see a mouse on the ground, I jump down to try to catch it. Years of working in a research lab, if someone dropped a mouse, you quickly try to pick it up. I was parking my bike downtown and saw a little field mouse slowly walking by. I was halfway down to it when I realized I shouldn't try to pick up wild mice.	0
What is the quickest that a first date has gone bad?	I went on a date with a girl my friends tried to set me up with, she insisted on going to Denny's at 2am and I fucking love Denny's at 2am so I agreed. what I didn't know was that she planned it at this time so she could go out drinking and show up shitfaced. she told the waitress to hurry up so we could leave and she could "get fucked". she ended up going under the table at one point and when I'm embarrassedly like *please stop I'm so embarrassed everyone's looking I could die right here* she proceeded to scream that she's just looking for my panties. also she drove there herself and took up like 4 parking spots.	The second thing out of his mouth was: "U2 is my favourite band. I've seen them in concert 12 times" Nothing wrong with that, but they are not even close to my favourite.	1
Women of reddit who had to end a relationship due to physical or emotional abuse, how did it start?	I saw red flags literally the first week we started talking. I was single and in college, and met him at a party. We talked and hung out and it was clear we were both interested. I was at his place a few days after we met, and he saw a text come through to my phone from a guy, and he flipped. That was the first sign and the beginning of an emotionally abusive relationship. There is so much more to it, but you asked for the start.	The very first red flag I remember was when my ex told me that the girl he'd had sex with the night before had a much tighter vagina and throat than I did (we were non-monogamous). When I tried to express how much that hurt to hear he pulled the whole "I'm just being honest! You don't want me to be honest??" shit, which ended up being his justification for most of the shitty things he'd say to me. Abusers will only change if they somehow learn to accept responsibility for the effects that their actions have on others. I've yet to meet an abuser who is capable of this, and I would *never* recommend putting up with abuse in the hope that it'll change. Even if you're aware that it's happening that shit changes you in ways that you cannot guard yourself against.	1
If you could talk to one person who is no longer in your life, who would you pick? What would you tell/ask them?	To my ex: My phone is auto-correcting what I want to say to you, so I'll stop fighting it. Duck you.	My late aunt. She passed a few years ago suddenly due to cancer. She was healthy and then within months was gone. I'd just thank her for showing me how to make baked ziti as a teen. I make it a few times a year and it's always a hit. But more importantly, it always reminds me of her, and I'm glad I'm able to share it with my family.	0
What's something you probably shouldn't find attractive, but do?	Acne scars/ imperfect skin-especially when they're not insecure about it. I don't know, I guess I love the fact that you can have this perfect guy flaunt an imperfection- the majority (not all) of guys I've been into didn't have clear skin and I was just into it.	Men capable and willing to dish out abuse. I had a thing for Christian Bale longer than I should have.	1
Women of Reddit who were skeptical of having kids and then did... Were you wrong about not wanting them? Did you have them because your SO wanted them? Was it an accident? Or...?	I was on the fence about it, but a firm no on bio. kids, so I fostered. All the joys of parenting, with kids that came pre-named and potty trained. Perfect solution for me, and I like angsty teenager age kids. 10/10, still a firm no on biologically having and raising kids	Total accident but I don't regret it. I love her she's funny and cute and smart she's four months and it's really cool getting to know her. Four days before I found out I was pregnant I walked in on my SO coked out having sex with a coworker on our couch. We decided to stay together for her and things have been pretty chill this past year.	1
What cosmetic surgery did you have done, and after everything was said and done was it worth it for you?	I had Ulthera after a horrible illness left me suddenly looking older. So so worth it and no down time. Fuck ablative procedures. They make you look fake.	I was eighteen when I had surgery on my eyes to "fix" my lazy eye problem. It didn't actually improve my vision. I only see through one eye at a time, but that surgery was to strip a few muscles so my unused eye looks like it's looking straight ahead. So even though my insurance didn't consider it cosmetic, literally the only thing that had a hope of changing was my appearance. People treated me much better ever since. I found it easier to make friends than ever before. And except for when I'm very tired or sick, my eyes still look normal seven years and two more eye conditions later. So. Yes. Definitely worth it.	0
What do you think of getting birth defect testing done when pregnant?	I married and had children late but I did not have any tests because I knew I wouldn't terminate, no matter what. That was my chance at being a mom - which I really wanted. Every person has a right to make their own decisions about their own lives, I respect that 100%. I know would have loved that child no matter what. I would like to foster older kids now. I already am a safe haven for some friends of my kids. I always have a bed, a ride or a meal ready for them when they need them.	Some people focus on the possibility that the parents will want to terminate (or give the child up for adoption) but there are other valid reasons to want the information sooner than birth. It could affect where you choose to deliver the baby, for example (especially if you anticipate the baby will need immediate and specialized care right after birth). Some treatment may even start before birth. It also gives you time to prepare, mentally, financially, etc. I have a cousin with Down Syndrome and many of my aunt & uncle's major financial and career decisions have been with his needs in mind (for example, living where they'll have a good support system and he can access high-quality services). There are certainly families who could benefit from knowing about things ASAP.	0
During your childhood, how (if at all) did your parents discuss race and/or racism with you?	My mother is very no-nonsense. Any time I mentioned I didn't like my hair or my skin color, she would basically tell me to cut that shit right out. "Your mom's black. Sorrynotsorry. You're never gonna look like Barbie. Self-acceptance is the best medicine." She'd also tell me and my brother that we were to be as non-threatening and as compliant as possible around cops. I remember her sitting us down and telling us not to fuck around if we ever got pulled over because they could kill us, especially my brother because he is male, autistic, and has Tourette's (so basically, the perfect storm of being read as a violent brown guy who comes off as aggressive due to uncontrollable tics and swearing, and also the inability to read situations as dangerous/serious).	Not really. I was raised in a very mixed neighborhood, so I grew up playing with blond and black kids and seeing no difference.	1
Mothers of Reddit, what is one time your mothers intuition saved your child's life? What is the story?	My mother saved me when I was a baby. As she tells it, she was having a bad dream about a clogged pipe and could hear me crying. In reality, I had gotten down from the bed in the dark early morning and started playing with the electric blanket dial. This was 1987, so it was just a piece of round plastic held on by a screw with a metal washer. Well little me thought it would be super fun to put the washer into my mouth, and it got stuck blocking my airway. I was not crying, just wobbling around on the carpeted floor making no noise. My dad says it can't have been more than 10 seconds from when I swallowed the washer to when mom woke up and grabbed me. Not sure if that counts as intuition, but I'm very glad she had that nightmare.	not a mother, but it makes me absolutely sick how many people in this thread have had doctors/nurses ignore them or tell them they're overreacting, and how many people were probably not lucky enough to manage to save their kids from this. this stigma that women are hysterical and crazy needs to stop especially since it's quite obvious a mother knows when something is wrong when her child.	1
What are the least glamourous parts of being a woman?	* Waking up in a pool of blood. * Vaginal discharge *period clots * ingrown hairs from shaving your bikini area * pantyhose wedgies * what I call "poop roulette" aka not knowing whether I have to poop or it's just cramps when I have my period. * (though I'm not personally going through this one) all of childbirth and the afterbirth process.	I'm glad that i don't have most problems other women have. Like i don't get my period anymore because i take the anti baby pill. (I occasionally get a little blood in my undies but that's okay. It happens only sometimes) My body is almost hairless and if i have hair it's so bright you can't really see it. Don't have any booby sweat cause mine are too small. I only hate it when your shaved pubic hair grows back. It's so itchy especially the part around the hole. Also if i don't clean my face enough before going to bed i get so many pimples..	1
What's the nicest thing your (current or ex) SO has said to/done for you?	My dad is pretty much housebound. I was at the hospital taking my mom off life support, and my husband realized that no one was with my dad (my dad also knew he couldn't take being there when my mom died: personal decision I completely respect). My husband packed up our little one, went over there and watched movies with my dad for the day. I hadn't even asked him. As long as I live, I will never forget that.	"I love you with every atom of my body and you can do no wrong." (which, you know, is silly, because I can) But still. This came after a shameful admission on my part, something I was kind of afraid to reveal, and although he understand the dark part of my personality that this involved, he was so loving and accepting of my past fuck-ups. He's knows I'm not perfect, and he loves me anyway.	1
Ladies, what compliment do you often receive that you either completely disagree with, find inappropriate, or even offensive?	Everyone tells me I'm cute or hot or sexy or beautiful or whatever. I don't get it. I definitely was all of those things. 25lbs ago. But now? I'm a whale, leave me alone. It's annoying.	(I'm Chinese) "Your English is so good!" Um I'm a native speaker, I was born in England and have lived here all 24 years of my life. I would hope so!	0
How many of you take meds for your depression/anxiety? Or do you deal with your depression/anxiety in ways that don't involve meds?	SSRIs have been very effective at treating my anxiety but have had very little effect on my depression. So, I'm still dealing with that. I currently take Paxil. Doctor is considering adding something on to augment it. As for being dependent on meds, there's nothing wrong with that. People with diabetes are dependent on insulin. People with bad eyesight are dependent on glasses. You have an illness and you have every right to treat it.	I actually suffered with depression and anxiety for a few years until i decided to do a food fast. 23 days on nothing but water, lost 8 kg. Something happened on thw 23rd day something inside of me just snapped. I slowly got better. and am now in free from depression and debilitating anxiety. never been on meds.	1
Why is the idea that a woman can easily find a boyfriend/significant other/partner so prevalent on Reddit?	I think the men who say this are defining "women" as "women I want to date." And they might also be defining "can easily find" as "I, personally, know right where it is." So when they say "Women can easily find a boyfriend", they're really saying "I know exactly where to find a guy who is willing to date the women I want to date!"	Because when we say that women have an easier time getting a man it means that women have easier access to sex. If a man were to ask a room full of women if any of them want to have sex with him all of them would say no. If a woman were to ask a room full of men if any of them want to have sex with her, at least one of them will say yes.	1
What's the most ridiculous or laughable insult you've ever received?	Three weeks ago I was called looseleaf by a guy. I stood there, perplexed. Finally I asked him what the hell that was suppose to mean. He said, "Because you are white, you know, loose-leaf paper is white." I just died laughing 😂😂😂	Some guy called me a cunt. I'd read the book as a teen (the book by the title of Cunt), plus am not American, so the term has never been offensive to me (and thanks to the book, I know it used to be a word of respect). Up to that point things were getting very heated - as soon as he said that I started genuinely laughing, said thank you and have a good night, and walked away in a good mood while he was left flabbergasted.	1
STEM Women, what challenges have you faced due to your gender? Do you feel that your skill is challenged due to it?	Nothing to offer, other than sending only the best thoughts your way, and as a fellow STEM PhD, though male, assure you that I will judge you on the quality of your output, not the person who writes it.	I'm majoring in Computer Science. Sometimes I feel like I have to work twice as hard for half of the credit, if that makes sense. I also find it challenging (as someone with fairly severe anxiety and a fear of being judged) to ask questions or seek help when I'm having trouble. I'm afraid I won't be a 'person looking for help', but a 'dumb girl in the wrong field'. Though I've made lots of friends (all male... who would have guessed?) which have really proven the contrary. While I may be the only girl or one of the only few in most of my classes, having some people who view me as a person rather than a minority gender really helps calm me.	0
What were you certain was not "just a phase," but turned out to be totally just a phase?	My hard left liberal phase. Stopped using certain words because they were offensive, constantly said that guys suck and stuff, and women are so under privileged. Now I'm just hating everyone and everything and hate the left as much as I hate the right. Solidly middle on a lot of shit at this point, and it feels more adult like than taking sides.	lol, I cringe when I think of my emo phase. My mam wouldn't even let me be a proper emo because I couldn't dye or straighten my hair. I was like emo lite.	0
What is your weirdest dealbreaker?	I'm not sure if this is necessarily weird, but I can't date someone who doesn't have a degree. I understand college isn't for everyone, but I'm not someone who wants to date a college isn't for everyone type of person.	brought someone to an indian restaurant and they called the waitress over to ask for ketchup, because he said he needed ketchup in his rice. was surprised an indian restaurant had no ketchup. kept complaining that they had no ketchup. BYE...	0
AW, what are some of the worst reasons to HAVE children that you've ever heard?	I used to have a friend who said he wanted kids for the benefits so he didn't have to work, even mentioned a few times that he hoped it would be disabled because then he would receive even more in benefits..... Couldn't believe my ears when he told me	Because I Want one (no bearing on if the children would hypothetically want to be born in the circumstances) So many people are so selfish when it comes to that decision.	1
What's the first time you saw your SO cry?	This past weekend. She had her period really bad and was dealing with some issues. Not much I could do but cuddle her and bring her water/tissues.	I made him watch The Notebook with me and while I was uglycrying into his shirt I could see a little tear in his eye. He denied everything.	0
What is your biggest breakup regret? Why did you break up with him/her? Why do you regret it?	I went on a few dates with a guy who was super sweet, shy and funny. We had a great time together our first couple of dates, but he had a nervous habit of asking REALLY dumb questions (and also he let me pay for stuff, but I'm only annoyed by that because I'm an asshole). I blew him off after the third date using that as an excuse, but I think really I was just afraid of getting closer to him. This was a few years ago and I still regret it sometimes. Looked him up a few months ago and he moved to a different state. C'est la vie.	Breaking up because of school. We planned on getting back together after he was done with school, and I planned on talking to him during summer break. I never saw him or spoke to him again, though, because he died just before the semester ended. 12 years of friendship, 8 years of dating. It seemed like a good decision, and I missed him, but we were doing pretty well. And then I got a call from one of our mutual friends. He told me to sit down, and he gave me the news. It might have been the right decision at the time, but I regret not calling him, texting him, telling him the whole thing was stupid and that I missed him too much during those 9 months before he died.	0
What are the most stupid stereotypes people have about your job?	When I tell people I'm a stay at home mom to a 9 month old. Their immediate assumption is it's not a real job because it's not your typical office, 9-5 job - I'm raising a human, we don't get breaks or even those lovely decompressing rides home from work. This is by far my hardest job I've ever had by far, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.	I work in pathology, and most people assume I spend my day cutting up dead bodies. 99.999999% of what we do is to diagnose/treat living patients. When I cut up a body, it's strictly recreational.	0
I'm getting a Brazilian wax next week. What are your tips for a first-timer?	definitely have a drink or two before. Trust me. Also, don't get waxed around when your period is. It makes us more sensitive to pain which I always thought was bullshit until I got a brazilian on my period. It ruined me for brazilians forever.	Wear cotton undies and wear a dress, skirt, or baggy pants. You might be a little sore after and friction won't feel nice.	0
Women of Reddit, When and how did you realise you were above/below average attractiveness?	When I was 14 and at the beach chilling with 2 of my friends both the same age, and a douchebag looking guy in a nice suit driving a ferrari approached us, wondering if we'd be interested in doing porn for a huge amount of money. We politely said no and told him our age, in which he replied; "Oh that's ok, no one will know". We got really creeped out but I guess most women in porn is pretty hot, so thanks??	I notice when I started college and began working. I am below average. I know this because how people treat me. No one goes out of their way to help me at work, but if this other girl has a little "issues" they all flock over to help. A lot of guys at my work won't even give me the time of day. I don't think anyone as called me out on my looks. I don't think I am ugly, I am more of an "ehh". Oh wells, I just need to work on myself more. I started a diet (Well a life change) a month ago and I lost about ten pounds now. Just 30 more to go!	0
If YOU could choose how you were going to be proposed to, how would you want it to happen?	On top of a mountain, hiking. Or after a thunderstorm in the middle of the grasslands. It sounds specific but we have been in that situation before and it was incredibly romantic. It's my favorite photo of us :)	No slow buildup. I don't get those proposals that are just an entire fun day that ends with a proposal. Everytime someone shares one of those stories, they're playing coy and pretending they didnt know it was coming... but it's totally obvious that it was happen. Had a friend and her boyfriend both tell me the date they were going to get engaged, later that weekend when she's sharing the story, she's trying to make it sound like a surprise, but it obviously wasn't. Ideally, I'd like a "y'know we're going to marry each other, right?" "oh yeah, of course." *pulls ring out* "wanna make it official?" OR something superficially horrible to happen, like falling in mud, before the proposal.	1
Women of Reddit how do you get rid of guys who don't take ' No' as an answer?	If you say “No” and the person won’t accept it, it is not your business to make them happy. Walk away. The reason people refuse to accept No for an answer, is because that want you to change your No into Maybe, and finally a Yes. The problem is, your initial/right/true/intuitive response was No, and they failed to respect it. The problem lies with them, not with you. Those who know no boundaries, no honor, no respect are really good at letting a No fly over their head, and continue to insist to get their way. Psychos are especially skilled at that. Just ask any victim of violence. And that’s why it’s not your responsibility nor obligation to deal with such people. There are a lot of respectful people in the world who’d enjoy your company and be honored by your presence.	I get really, really gross. One dude at a bar didn't take no for an answer. I was drunk so when he said, "I got a pocket full of condoms." I blurted back, "And I've got a pussy full of blood." He actually physically retched and walked away while I cackled.	0
What's something that others often freak out about but you don't think is a big deal?	Periods. Women have them, and I don't understand why so many women make such a big deal out of trying to hide it.	Doing pretty much anything by myself. I am happily married but if my husband is busy or doesn't want to go, I have no problem going to dinner or a movie or anything really by myself.	0
Dear AskWomen, as someone currently with cramps in a fetal position how do you stay productive during your period?	I take 6 Aleeve every 4 hours, and eat some hot soup to calm my stomach or drink hot chocolate, plus two heating pads. I also do Lamaze breathing. If it's really going to be that bad, I'll just take the day off.	I eat a fuck ton, drink a fuck ton, and try to do as little physical labor as possible. I've found that exercise makes things worse for me personally. So so so much worse.	0
What was your last straw with a former friend, where you said I don't ever want to see this person again?	Friend of mine was murdered really horribly, I rang another friend in tears and absolutely destroyed, asked her to come spend the day with me. Her response was "oh I have physio... and work later... maybe saturday?(it was thursday)" I was speechless, and hung up with her - later got a message that she couldn't do Saturday as she was busy. Found out later she was at a party with her boyfriend.	Me: -Gets phone call- Friend: XXXXXX stole $200 from me. I know because I went to take a shower and when I went back to my room it was missing from my wallet. She's the only one home. I used to live with XXXXXX and stuff would go missing constantly. I had a hunch it was her and could never prove it. As soon as she got caught, I was done with her. 25 years of best friendship be damned.	0
What's the worst relationship advice you've ever received?	For me, personally, it's that you can't know someone without living with them before you get married. I don't agree at all, and I think that not doing so was a very good choice, and that living together is often just a kick of the can. Not always, but I've seen it happen that way	Anything that I would consider a "game", such as "don't ever be the first one to text him, wait for him to contact you", "don't send him a text after the first date saying you had fun", etc. I've found that stuff only works in the very short-term. If a guy is genuinely interested sending him too many texts won't scare him away.	0
I'm moving into college in three weeks and I have no decorations! What's some cheap, cool ideas?	You're gonna move so many times on the next few years. Buy nothing, things just appear and follow you from house to house.	Zen Minimalism. Get some nice looking rocks from the driveway, a bonsai or other cheap plant. Done. Another option could be : don't decorate on arrival. Just bring in some nice bedding, cushions and blankets, and leave space for your new home to be organically filled by all the things you'll love over the next few months.	0
Women on the autism spectrum, what was the moment that made you suspect something was wrong?	I've always had a harder time with things than others. When I was in my late 30's I took a test just for fun and scored super super high on it. It was then that I took a few years and started doing research on it. It totally explained my life.	Not so much a realisation that something was 'wrong', but a realisation there was a name to my experiences. I always had problems socialising with others, to the point where I seriously thought I was an alien observing others. They didn't get me and I clearly didn't get them. I was bullied for my quirks and school was generally miserable. Then when I was a teen, I read a book called Nobody Nowhere where the author wrote about being autistic. That's when the penny first dropped - that there were others who felt off-kilter to others and it had a name.	0
What are some seemingly innocuous things your parents said that messed you up more than they maybe thought it would?	They made a lot of complaints about my hair. I have curly hair and neither of my parents do, so I guess they didn't know what to do with it. They made disparaging remarks whenever we went somewhere together, like "Can't you run a comb through that rat's nest?" Of course, combing and brushing the shit out of it just made it worse, it got so frizzy and poufy. And then the icing on the cake is that when they adopted my sister, who is biracial, they went out of their way to find out how to care for her hair and buy whatever products she needed. And they'll rub it in my face (completely unaware of what they're doing) by comparing her hair to mine, "Oh her hair is just so gorgeous, don't you wish you had hair like hers when you were her age?"	Oh lawdy, I fear I am the asshole saying damaging things. Just today I asked her if she could use her paws to open a package for me, and she asked 'why do you keep calling my hands paws?" and I say **BECAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE A DOG!** Oh my, it still makes me laugh. But seriously I am constantly saying these mean things because it is incredibly funny and because that's my way of saying *I love you*.	1
Happily married people, when did you realize your marriage was awesome and what makes it awesome?	I've always known my marriage is awesome. Lots of things make it awesome but i think the main point would be: - we work hard on it and regularly check in with each other about how our relationship is going	Same here--my marriage is easy. Married a year and a half, together for 5, friends since we were in middle school. We know each other and strive to learn each others' changes. We laugh a LOT and share a similar sense of humor. We fight sometimes. We make up. We put in effort without knowing we're putting it in, because we love each other and want to make the other's life easier. We pick up the slack without question when the other is down. We thank each other every day. It's awesome.	1
What book(s) are you currently reading?	I'm currently reading **Stillhouse Lake** by Rachel Caine. It's about a woman who discovers that her husband's a serial killer after he gets caught, and is dealing with the aftermath of everything. I'm a huge fan of thriller/mysteries.	I'm reading The Handmaid's Tale for school, about 3/4 done with it. Honestly I think it's pretty interesting so far but too bad I heard (from a friend) that the show was bad.	1
Have you ever dated a guy after he's been abused by a woman? What was that like for you?	he was verbally teased (and even slightly physically) by a bit older girls in highschool for "supposedly being cute" (his words) made him very afraid of girls so he stayed virgin for a half a decade longer, he never knew whether they mock him or is he really good looking (he is, or is now). He thought it wasn't the latter. Oh and also they teased him whether he has "giant cock" (they must've been very drunk) so he felt really bad and terribly insecure because he is average. It's weird because he now likes that I am a couple of years his senior and overall more experienced, to be precise he likes it sexually (or maybe he was conditioned to like it, not really a simple situation).	A guy I dated lost his virginity through rape when he was very young (it was an older, stronger girl who did it to him). He somehow couldn't stay in the moment during sex. He couldn't let go. He had these moments where he just had to stop all of a sudden, he had to know it was on his terms I guess. It was really sad. Made me really angry at the girl who did it to him. She took something from him that is gone probably forever. Though we didn't work out as a couple (he had all sorts of issues with commitment), we stayed friends for a pretty long time. I cared about him a lot.	0
What's a ridiculous rule your parents had when you were young?	Growing up, the rule via my Atlanta, Georgia retired drug enforcement cop parents was I wasn't allowed to date black guys because 'that's not what we do in this family'. Now I'm only ever date black guys, pale skin doesn't do it for me.	Mine gave me a curfew but kept pushing it back later and later - first 11, then 12, then 1. I didn't socialize much and certainly didn't party, and I got the impression that they set the first curfew expecting to have to rein me in, and then got worried I wasn't social enough so they'd push it back to try to get me to go out more. One time in my senior year I did stay out past midnight. My mom called me *losing her shit* that she wanted me home even though she knew where I was and my "curfew" wasn't passed yet. I didn't have a car, and my friends weren't ready to leave to I had to beg a boy I barely knew for a ride, basically put myself in a more dangerous situation due to my mom's anxiety.	0
Ladies 20 and older, what are your experiences with teenagers trying to hit on you?	It's usually a really quick "hey, would you go out with me?" kinda thing where I'm pretty sure they're only partially serious, so I just smile, say no, and go on my way. One time, though, when I was drawing at a park, this 15 year old skateboarded up to me, started a conversation, then slid onto the bench next to me acting all suave. It was adorably hilarious, like watching a puppy learn to walk. When I realized he was not just making friendly conversation (I'm slow sometimes) I dropped my age, which he took in stride, so then I mentioned my husband. To which he said "aw, man, you're married? Well, it was nice to talk to you!" and skated off. Kid had game!	I am fat and apparently give off a kind of motherly/grandmotherly vibe in person (despite the fact that I'm not even in my thirties yet), so thankfully it doesn't happen in the real world. Every once in a while some kid will try to chat me up online, and when that happens I just laugh at them and then block them.	1
Women who cohabitate, what's the best thing about living with your SO?	You all are making me sad that I have to do long-distance for nine months while I finish my grad degree and my SO starts hers across the country.	Pros: I have a personal heater in my bed during the winter. Cons: I have a personal heater in my bed during the summer.	0
Ladies with facial hair and sensitive skin, how do you remove your hair without getting pimples everywhere?	I use to just shave daily and suffer the pimples since I have eczema as well. If you can afford it I would absolutely recommend laser hair removal it changed my life.	Hair conditioner worked for me when I shaved my legs a lot playing volleyball and basketball back in the day. No rash or bumps or ingrown hairs.	1
What is something you were told "you'll change your mind" about and you eventually did? What about things you'll never change your mind about despite being assured that you will?	Salads and onions. I can tolerate them now because I forced myself to. I'll never change my mind about having kids. I get *strong* feelings of disgust when I'm anywhere near kids. People shouldn't be encouraging people to have kids when they hate them! Getting sterilized in the next few years. Oh, and a (now former) coworker told me I'd change my mind about Trump because I'm smart. 😂😂😂	I changed my mind about working in an office. I used to swear up and down that I'd never work a boring, lame, stuffy cubicle job because that would be *selling out,* man! Uh, yeah. Give me a steady schedule, benefits and contribute to my retirement any day of the week! I don't think I will change my mind about not wanting kids, though.	0
Do you use your sick pay days and when you're not really sick, what are your reasons?	No such thing as sick days in my country, but I do occasionally stay at home without a good reason. Sometimes if I'm feeling a bit unter the weather, sometimes if I need a mental health day, sometimes if I just can't be arsed and have better plans to spend my day. At my job it also doesn't *really* matter. I should technically be in when I'm supposed to be in, but as long as my hours at the end of the month are fine noone cares.	My company just has a set amount of PTO days (paid time off). We can use them for whatever we want, no justification or explanation necessary. I often use them to just have a relaxation day, mental health break, a clean the house and run errands day, escape down the coast day, etc. One time I even used one to stay home and play the new Zelda video game for like 12 hours straight.	0
What was the most uncomfortable thing you’ve had to do for your SO out of politeness?	Went suit shopping with my SO and his mom and she kept talking to the tailor about how my SO needs "*just a little more room in the package area*" and trying to get me to confirm for her. Like no lady I'm not gonna talk with you about your son's dick but thanks anyway.	Listen to his mother in law talk about my husbands brothers balls (cancer). She asked me to check to make sure my husbands were ok.	1
What is the shittiest apology you've ever received?	He broke up with me abruptly over the phone and then shrugged at me the next day when i questioned him before class.	A coworker secretly recorded me and then said he was sorry he made a "tactical error" during the meeting with our boss. It was the closest I've ever come to physically attacking someone.	0
What is something that many other women do that you can't really relate to or understand?	1) wearing too much clothing. I don't mean wear a bikini all day, but I can't wear more than a layer or two without being uncomfortable. 2) wearing excessive amounts of jewelry. This probably goes with #1, I just don't like wearing lots of clothes. 3) makeup and hair routines. Why lose multiples of hours of sleep just to look like everyone else? AND it costs oodles of money. NO. THANK. YOU. Edit: Funny that some seem so offended by what I said, I was answering a question and interacting positively to those I spoke to in the thread. If you don't like something move on, right? So why the downvotes?	High heels (over 3") as work wardrobe. How do you not end up with aching feet and legs every day?	0
What's the most bizarre sexual request that more than one partner has asked of you?	I've had more than one guy ask me if they could cum in my eye. I declined the tempting offer. Also, singing is one of my hobbies and my ex would ask me to try and sing while we had sex. The song I got closest to completing was I Believe I Can Fly by R Kelly.	More than one guy has asked to spank my ass during sex. Not sure about other girls, total turn off for me.	1
All these 'red flag' questions are so negative! Would any women of reddit like to share a story where the date went a lot better than expected?	I didn't really date, I just slept with people. My now husband took me on a date and we had sushi and it was so fun to share that experience! I never had sushi and sake before! Obviously it went well because we are now married with three kids!	Want to know the truth? I've had some awkward and mediocre first dates that showed that even when there's no chemistry people can still be good. Like the guy I met who was so nice, but not what I was looking for at all. He asked if he could hug me, I said yes. We talked later and both agreed that there was no chemistry. And that was it. No weirdness. He was a good guy.	0
What are your tips for being the hottest/most attractive (appearance wise) version of yourself?	I feel the hottest on a regular day (say, just work and grocery shopping), when I'm wearing something that makes me look professional, smart, and like I have my sh*t together. Throw on a pair of sunglasses and I'm good to go. Daily I focus on skincare, drinking enough water, and practicing good self-care so I remain happy and confident.	For me: Don't eat things that lead to bloating or make you feel gross. Dairy, excessive fried foods, processed sugars, excessive alcohol all make me feel gross. When you feel gross, it shows. Keep your teeth, hair, and body clean. Minimal hair styling, if any. Let that curl go nuts. Minimal makeup, if any. Confidence and comfort are attractive, and I am profoundly uncomfortable with makeup on my face. So trying to "look pretty" is counterproductive. Clothes that fit well. Good skincare. Get (close to) enough sleep (as often as possible). Don't skip workouts too often. The exertion is good for the body. Good posture.	1
Solo female travelers of Reddit, what tips, advice, or warnings do you have for females traveling alone for the first time?	I have been to 4 continents, 25+ countries including the Middle East. My only advice is to not listen to too much advice but follow your heart. I walk around in tank tops and skirts at night and I am fine. I recommend self-esteem, a confident posture and no fears but rather excitement for the adventures ahead.	Practice resting bitchface. My default public persona is 'on the way to do a murder', and it's served me well.	0
Women with a fear of driving, how did you get over it and become a confident driver?	Tbh I still have some driving driving, but just doing it more makes you less nervous. I got my license on my 16th birthday, but I didn't do any real driving like getting on the interstate until I was 19. Most of the time, things aren't as bad as your brain is making it seem. This week, I drove two hours to help my friend move into her apartment at her college, and I thought the drive would be awful, but for the most part, it was uneventful.	Practice. The only thing that makes you a confident driver is having to do it. I started out on quiet backstreets with not much traffic. Then on busier roads. Unfortunately, it is only way you get confidence with a skill is through practising it and getting experienced. Don't drive with other people in the car if that freaks you out. Or only drive with people who don't distract you /make you feel stressed.	0
Where do you live, how much do you pay in rent, and how much space do you get for what you pay?	I live in a middle class "ethnic" neighborhood in Queens. I pay $1700 for a 800 square foot one bedroom. I moved there with my ex-fiance, he since moved out. It's more than I need, but I can afford it, it's rent stabilized, and moving is a pain in the ass.	Currently in Tennessee, my boyfriend and a friend of ours are all renting a 3br/2ba duplex for $650, so around $220 a piece. It's not terribly big, but it's enough space for the three of us and after looking around at other rental options in my area, what we've got is a damn good deal.	0
Ladies who were "late bloomers" in certain areas of life, how are things now? And what advice would you give to others in that position?	I was a late bloomer in terms of learning. I was at the bottom of my second-grade class for reading. I went from remedial level to advanced almost overnight. Something clicked and I just figured it out. From there on out, I always tested one to two grades higher in reading and writing. Same thing with learning how to tell time, math, etc.	I was the last girl in my grade to get my period. I was almost 16 and then it came once, and then did not come again for another nine months. DO NOT pretend that you have your period. You will have it for long enough. There is nothing wrong with you! Also, if you pretend you have it, then girls will be very suspicious when you ask for a tampon, but they see it fall out of your pocket four hours later....try explaining that one!	0
What's it like to marry the only person you've ever dated?	Not certain, am unmarried. I am curious to how it's like if you are less experienced and/or a late bloomer seeing/dating/married someone with an extensive or more richly varied breadth of experience. *asking for a friend*	It is pretty nice overall. I was never much into dating around or the hookup culture and was a bit cynical about relationships because my family is so dysfunctional. I spent my 20s alone and traveling and enjoying my time, met my husband at 28, got married at 32, almost 35 now. Every now and then I wish I'd had sex with other men besides my husband before we met, but sex is very vulnerable and intimate to me so I feel like I spared myself a lot of heartbreak and sorrow. Plus, all the time alone before he and I met made me strong and independent and helped me love and accept myself on my own.	0
If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?	I would have liked not to be raised in a bubble by helicopter parents. My mom has recently apologized for making me think that everything is "scary" as a kid. Couldn't ride bike alone, go to the park alone, go to sleepovers, etc. I was a very lonely, anxious child.	I wish I wouldn't have grown up in the church. Looking back, I realize how brainwashed I was by their morals and ideas. I fell victim to a lot of bullying for it. I was sexually assaulted by members of the church. It was just a bad thing for me. Now, my parents don't even go. Edit: Fuck you to whoever downvoted this.	1
What things would you have done differently/prepared for if you had known your ex was going to break up with you?	Not spend a shit ton of money getting an artist to make a portrait of us for Valentines Day, since he broke up with me the day before hahahaahahaaaaaa (Don't worry - I cropped him out, now I have a cool ass cartoon picture of myself)	I would have broken up with her sooner to lessen the blow. She stayed just long enough for me to care too much about her problems. I too often end up someone's free therapist who spends too much time worrying about them and sacrificing time and energy to them, all just to be repaid with 'things are a little difficult for me, I quit'	1
How do you feel about homeschooling?	i love the idea of homeschooling! if i have children they will all be homeschooled. i would not take on this task myself, but hire a professional. i think i would also be sure to live in a neighborhood with many other families so my children wouldn't lack socialization. i would have them join local sports teams, girl/boy scouts, etc. i really like the idea of my children experiencing individual based learning. i think i was hindered in public school because i was afraid to ask questions in fear of looking dumb and i really struggled for a bit in college not knowing the basics. also the people i met who were homeschooled were much more advanced than other kids who were attending their public school.	I'm a public school teacher. I can COMPLETELY understand that there are tons of issues with public school these days, but there aren't many situations where I'd recommend home schooling.	0
What is something that you will always regret for the rest of your life and always deter others from doing/getting into?	Several years ago, someone set off one of those supposedly silent dog repelling whistles. The sound of that thing invaded my bones, and I very nearly threw up. Sister said the same thing. That day I learned that your hearing starts to deteriorate around age 20. We googled why we were the only ones affected and no one else seemed to notice.	Staying in an abusive relationship. Also, completely sacrificing your friendships for a relationship, which goes hand-in-hand with abuse a lot of the time. Staying with a cheater and trying to work it out. Becoming FWBs with someone you still have feelings for. Quitting a hobby or passion you truly enjoy, especially if the reason for quitting is because your dead end job sucks the life out of you and leaves no energy for other things.	0
What do most people overestimate or underestimate about you?	Overestimate: My ability to do a 9-5 job. I'm very skilled, but I work way under my paygrade because of my health. I can't progress consistently, and people are always disappointed in me even though I warn them that I'll progress so far and then likely crash. Underestimate: How fucking badass I can be. I got a large metal splinter in my arm and when they removed it I didn't cry out or anything. When you're in pain all the time, you just kind of manage it?	They overestimate my intelligence. I'm really not that bright. I just watch a lot of documentaries and full of useless information. I don't think anyone underestimates anything about me.	0
What are some "weird" things you and your SO do when you're alone together?	We are not into anal. However, if either of us are ever above the other on a staircase, our finger goes in their butthole. We scream and have an awkward dance on the stairs trying to avoid getting poked while also trying to poke the other person. We also decided that our dog thinks everywhere is the dog park. His grandpas house? The dog park where we sit in the car for 10 hours but she gets a lot of treats from the old man. The vet? The dog park with the ladies who stick things up her butt. The actual dog park? The dog park she does not like because there are too many other dogs.	Make noises at each other. Like, it might start as an actual conversation and just devolve into going "meeerrrrhhhh" back and forth. Example: "Hey, what you doin?" "Meh" "Meh?" "Meeeehhhh" "Muuuugggghhhh" "Bleh" "Bleeeeeggghhhh" And so on until we get tired of it.	0
What has been your "nice guy" experience?	I read some of these stories, women. I don't know if I'm an awful man or someone amazing but what I'm sure is that I'll try my best not to make the mistakes your "men" made. I will stick with my principles though but I'm opened to some changes if necessary.	I have a boss that is nice. He's been my boss one day a week for five years. He is devoted to his wife. She has advanced dementia. He is kind, thoughtful, faithful, sleeps in the same bed as his wife and does all of the cooking, cleaning, personal care for his wife and most home maintenance. I've stayed working there because as a single woman, I rarely see that. If I need any supplies, they are always there. It is a breath of fresh air.	0
Women, who did date the "nice guy", what happened?	All of mine ex's are "the nice guy". My current boyfriend is the poster boy for "nice guy" and "friend zone". As much as I like the whole "bad boy" image, I'm also not stupid.	I went out with him twice and if I didn't do everything he wanted exactly like he wanted he pitched a fit like a spoiled toddler. Only this spoiled toddler was 6'2 and 30 years old. His anger was much more dangerous.	0
When was the last time you were legitimately scared of a man?	I was raped a few weeks ago in my own home. Been pretty on edge about the guy coming back. Anyway, my brother came by to visit one morning and let himself in. He had texted me to say he was coming over but I slept through the texts. I woke up because he said something from the kitchen and I didn't recognize his voice. All I heard was a man in my house and I was scared shitless for a second until he said something else and I realized it was him.	When I realized the guy with blown up ears and an 8 pack was my next opponent. My fear was well founded as he effortlessly took me down and mauled my half guard for 5 long minutes before the clock ran out.	1
You have an unlimited budget, 48 contestants and a one year time span to film a 52 episode seasson: What kind of reality show would you create and why?	A hunger games type situation for criminals on death row- volunteer based only. If they win and there's no chance of rehabilitation, they get a luxury suite with all the amenities of a five star life (while still being incarcerated) for the rest of their lives. If they win and there's a chance of rehabilitation, same thing until they are rehabilitated.	Put 50 skilled people (carpenters, survivalists, nurses, etc.) on a deserted island and let them "build" a society over the course of a year. No voting people off, no competitions for prizes - just literally letting them live and build and create and fight and live for a year. There was that "Utopia" show that was kind of similar, but they voted people in and out and had all these mini-competitions, but I'd want a show that's more about the struggle of rebuilding as opposed to a show that's about people competing to stay. My show wouldn't be a competition - more of a social experiment. I think the drama would produce itself in time.	0
What are the top five best decisions you ever made?	1. Getting out of the cesspool that was the part of nyc they dont show you on tv. 2. Moving to another country on a whim 3. Saying no to drugs 4. Being there for my friends 5. Buying a brand new mattress with my savings.	1. Joining rugby 2. Joining rugby 3. Joining rugby 4. Joining rugby 5. Joining rugby Everything else good in my life stems from that one decision. Friends, etc.	1
What’s the most profound thing you’ve read or heard about love?	There is no such thing as love, only proofs of love. -Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne (Robert Bresson but dialogue probably by Jean Cocteau) 1945	In BoJack Horseman, when Wanda the Owl says, "you know, it's funny; when you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags." That shouldn't have hit so hard but for some reason it really did.	0
Anyone else confident when single but an insecure mess in a relationship? Why do you think that is the case?	Guy here. Monogamy does it to me. I've put all my eggs in one basket and I'm hoping she's done the same. The paranoid side of me comes out thinking "I need to be aware and catch her so I don't throw away months or years of my life with a cheat". Currently in a non monogamous relationship and it's great. Emotionally I'm all hers, but I sleep around too, so I know that at any time we could part ways for whatever reason and I won't feel cheated. Say what you want, but it works for me.	When you're single, you have nothing to lose. If things don't work out with someone, you just move onto the next one. In a relationship, you're likely invested and don't want to lose them. So you worry about screwing things up.	0
What is a simple question you want to ask to the women from a certain country?	From the US, asking u/Redhaired103 and other Turkish AW posters: What is it actually like living in Erdogan's Turkey and what is the general popular sentiment? Every time I hear something coming out of there it sounds more and more 1984- purging intellectuals, imprisoning journalists, consolidating power, mass robocall recordings, blocking internet access... but my news is skewed towards sensational, negative things and apparently he still retains a lot of support? What is his base? (This may not be a simple question tho...sorry)	For American ladies: if I were to travel to the US on a vacation next summer, what are absolute do's and don'ts? Also, what cities are absolutely worth visiting in your opinion? Is accommodation cheap? I'm from the Netherlands by the way!	1
For women over fifty, what are your favorite beauty tips you've learned through the years?	My mom is 63 and looks 40. She has perfect skin, and people always ask what her secret is. She always says plenty of water, daily excersise, clean diet, sunscreen, and happy thoughts.	I'm 36, happy, drink water religiously, eat healthy, not exercise much and smoke occasionally. I have a lot of improving to do!	1
How do you cope with being unattractive?	"Unattractive" on whose scale, the billion dollar 'beauty' industry? My god, the amount of time and money women could save if we could just reject these artificial standards. Be kind to yourself and equally important be kind to others. How radical would it be if we all just stopped commenting on each others looks?	There are good days and bad days. Sometimes, I can just let go and have fun... but the moment someone posts pictures of all the fun we had, those memories turn sour. I try to deal with that by not taking pictures or avoiding any cameras that come out. I also try to maintain myself in other ways, like my fitness level, since I can't really change my face. Therapy helped a lot, but I still struggle a lot with body issues and eating disorders.	0
Anyone get married for reasons other than love? How did it turn out?	I got married because I wanted to run away from my family and my home country. He was older and knew why I was doing it and he was fine with it. I liked him a lot, but love didn't have much to do with our marriage.	My ex is getting married to the girl he started dating a week after me and has only been with for 10 months. I think he just really wants to be married- and anyone who fits the basic qualifications will do.	1
Women with anxiety: what is the most irrational thought/worry you've ever had?	in public, I'm frequently *terrified* that other people can hear my thoughts and that I'm the only one without this ability. I have to try to think only nice thoughts and I think of a compliment for people around, just in case. I have pretty severe OCD, though. I've never mentioned this to anyone. Oddly scary.	My thoughts aren't irrational. I'm nervous about real things like getting into a car accident, someone breaking into my home, people looking at me etc.	1
Aussies of AskWomen, how are you handling the Australian Marriage Law Survey?	It's extremely frustrating that we even have to have this debate. And some of the things that have been said are very hurtful to the LGBT+ community. I ticked Yes.	Everyone is quite decided on where they stand, and I feel people are entitled to their opinions. Saying that, I'm pretty confident the majority will vote "yes". I've heard of several instances where people have poked through their neighbours' mailboxes and stolen their letters, and even of postal workers who have disposed of envelopes voting a certain way, which is quite disheartening to see.	1
Whats the unwritten rule at your job?	If there's free cake or cookies in the kitchen, you get one and only one serving. Don't be a hog.	Don't wear plaid, unless you're a girl then you just shouldn't wear plaid but noone will say anything to you about it. AKA almost everyone wears plaid on Fridays.	1
This might be the stupidest question on this sub but... I [M29] just started dating my first girlfriend. What do I need to know about menstruation?	Not if but when she is mean to you for no good reason for the love of goodness don't get mad back. 1; that's unfair because she can't control how she feels. And 2; it will only make things worse. Plus she'll probably apologize at some point if she's a decent girl. Also, my girlfriend is a salty food person but every time she goes berserk for chocolate, so buy lots of tampons and lots of chocolate and try to understand she's probably in more pain than you've experienced all month and her hormones are so out of whack she doesn't know left from down or backwards from diagonal. Hope this helps.	Do offer a little sympathy if a woman complains; don't go into crazy overprotective mode. We've dealt with this every month since our teens: if there was a way for you to magically fix things, we would have asked for it by now. 'Let me know if there's anything you want or need' is a good thing to say. Sometimes a foot rub or hot water bottle is nice, but honestly the only way for you to know when that might be is if we tell you. Women have different levels of comfort for talking about menstruation, but a matter-of-fact, chilled attitude from a guy is rarely offensive. (Oh, and if you're ever asked to fetch a clean pair of knickers for a woman on the loo, please select comfy, sturdy ones, not wispy lacy ones.)	0
Women with partners 10+ years younger, what is your relationship like?	I'm 56 partner is 24. I thought I'd be showing him some great sex tricks but I wS pleasantly surprised about how much he knows!! He's the best sexual partner I've ever had. We like to play mommy son public. So if you're sitting somewhere where we have an audience I will ask him "son have you done your chores " and say a few other things where people obviously think we are mother and son and then I will suddenly start kissing him passionately on the mouth.	I’m 45 and my husband is 33. Honestly, I never think about our ages anymore. In the beginning of our relationship (4 years ago) I was very insecure because I was done having children (per my doctor) and I knew he always thought he would have at least one biological child. Then I went on a diet, lost weight, my health improved and on my 43 rd birthday I got the surprise of my life and found out I was expecting. 2.5 years later we have a two year old son. I used to always feel like he had more energy than me but now we’re both exhausted. But so happy.	0
At 25 years old, would you date a younger person and if so, what's your cut off?	I started dating an ex when I was 25 and he had jusssst turned 21. If he had been 20 that would have been fine too, but I wouldn't have gone younger than that.	I don't have much of an interest in younger guys, but I wouldn't be completely opposed if I met someone I clicked well with. My cutoff would be 21 because I definitely couldn't date someone who couldn't legally drink.	0
Are there any 25+ ladies who have never dated?	I've never really "dated". I had a "relationship" in high school, but that was basically holding hands and then we never talked again. I'm basically a human ball of anxiety and self-loathing. Not exactly great relationship material. I don't know that it's really affected my life at all. I just kind of do my thing.	I'm demiromantic so I rarely feel romantic attraction. I need to become close friends with someone to feel anything, and even then, I've had three crushes. Two asked me out. For reasons I don't want to go into, I told both, "No." Things were complicated, and they're in the past. It hasn't felt like it's impacted my life much. I miss the feeling of a crush, but beyond that? You can't miss what you haven't experienced. Dating people I don't know to try and find someone doesn't interest me, and tbh, if I tried that, it'd be less Tinder and more Friender. I've had some marvelous friendships though.	1
Whats the first thing you thought when you saw your SO for the first time?	"Thank God he's taller than me." I met him from Tinder and I had forgotten to ask how tall he was when we were messaging, and I'm 5'9 so it wasn't a given. I wore flats to the date and crossed my fingers! I told him later and he thought it was funny, so all's well that ends well.	"What a shithead." He had just accidentally backed into me as I walked behind his car in a CVS parking lot. We just got engaged last week!	0
Women who have worked in retail or restaurants, what's the worst customer you have ever experienced?	People have always been nasty, but the only ones who stood out are the older ladies who would rather wait longer in line than be checked out by me, who was wearing a hijab at the time. It was obvious.	I worked at wendys for a year. One night around 9 a couple came in and got a ton of stuff, asking for it all made fresh. The girl got 20 nuggets with cheese sauce and called herself a pig. They went to a table and ate, no problems. After they left I went to clean the table and there was cheese sauce and chili spread all over the table. Half eaten chicken nuggets everywhere. Napkins thrown everywhere, including the floor. With that many Napkins, they could have cleaned up their mess. The girl was right. She is a pig.	0
What do you think about "micro-cheating"?	This whole mess makes me glad my partners are super introverted. They don't go to bars alone, or have any female friends they hang with or really do much of anything without our whole group. Also they don't use social media much. So yeah, just gonna be happy this isn't a concern for me because it sounds tiring.	I don't understand the concept of "micro-cheating". What I do understand is the concept of relationship boundaries. Every relationship partner should have their boundaries and if their partner goes outside of the agreed upon boundaries, then I think that is a betrayal by their partner. Whether or not they want to call that cheating, "micro-cheating", or whatever doesn't matter to me.	0
Do you ever have days where you're just feeling toxic and mean, and you just want to cuss out anybody who has been bothering you that week?	No. Gee, I really am an oddball, I guess. I never have a desire to be toxic or mean to anyone. Even if they have done something wrong to me, I feel guilt over having feelings of hate towards them. I think that might just come from me being an unconfident person, though. Edit: Aaaand of course I get downvoted for having an unpopular experience (and saying that I'm NICE to people!), surprise surprise	Yup, for sure. I tend to bottle my emotions and ignore them so sometimes, when things get a bit too much, they threaten to bubble over. If I know I'm being unreasonable and don't want to actually raise the issue, I'd journal. I'd write letters to express my annoyance and just cuss as much as I want to (or don't) on those letters. I've never sent these letters and would never, ever would because they're petty as hell, but it usually helps.	0
In a relationship, besides jealously, what instantly screams "insecurity" to you?	I know a few couples that constantly post over the top lovey dovey stuff on Facebook. These are the same couples that regularly break up and get in major fights. Now every time I see someone in a couple post tons of mushy garbage, I just assume their relationship sucks and they're just trying to prove it to other people/themselves that their relationship is actually solid.	Being a people pleaser. I can't be with a guy who takes longer doing his hair than I take with mine, and if they keep up with social media waaay too often.	1
For anyone who meal plans/meal prep, what are you eating for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks this week?	Breakfast: scrambled eggs with cottage cheese, or cereal (bran flakes) Lunch: salad (carrot, cucumber, iceberg lettuce, chickpeas, corn) or soup! Dinner: teriyaki chicken or honey mustard chicken and veg (carrots, onions, pumpkin, cauliflower, cabbage)	We make smoothies for breakfast every morning. I bring grapes as a snack, and this week we made chili for lunch! It's finally feeling like fall here, which means it's crockpot season!	0
What little thing annoys you much more than it reasonably should?	When people respond with an insult like "sheep." Don't address why they disagree. Don't state any alternative evidence. Don't even say they disagree - just immediately name call. It's so gross.	Counting calories -- why can't you just eat what's healthy for you? Your body already has a way of telling you when you've had too much. It's called FULL! I know I should be happy for people who are trying to be healthier, but it kinda irks me. It seems like the easy way out. I could eat 2000 calories of delicious microwave pizza rolls and pringles and that doesn't mean I'm much better off! You don't even have to be rich to eat better foods, just cook or buy things not canned or packaged.	1
women who decided to get an abortion but your SO wanted to keep it, how did it go?	My abortion failed, he didn't want to put her up for adoption when I had her, now I have a daughter with a horribly abusive man.	My advice would to be get the abortion. As the woman and primary person responsible for carrying the child and most likely for the rest of the 18 years, him not respecting your decision is a huuuuuuuge red flag. 9 out of 10 he will turn abusive ( if he isn’t already) with or without the child. Get the abortion and find a better man, don’t put up with abuse, you deserve better.	1
Women of reddit, if your partner "stealthed" a condom off during sex how would you react? Has it ever happened to you or someone you know?	I. Was. Pissed. At the time, I didn’t know it was the name for it. We weren’t seeing one another exclusively, we weren’t “dating”. He just slipped it off right st the end, it happened so fast. I got out of bed, (my bed) and stepped on it. And I didn’t say anything. He got up, got dressed and I walked him to the door & I said: “Oh, that thing where you take the condom off at the last second? Don’t fucking do that.” And I never heard from him again.	Doesn't that count as rape in some places? I'm aware that it does open up a can of worms about other things eg if women try lying that they're on birth control. I dunno how that would be categorised. Especially as mistakes happen, with condoms and with birth control. Even perfect use doesn't guarantee a perfect result. So how do you prove anything either way? No one that I know has done this, thank goodness.	1
How are some of you able to wear jewelry specifically earrings permanently, they are so uncomfortable it’s like never taking off your makeup kinds of uncomfortable?	I wear a ring every day. I never notice it unless I take it off for something -- then I check my finger every 10 seconds and feel extremely uncomfortable. As for earrings, I've been lazy lately but I wore them every day for 10 years. I choose small ones that don't weigh much or swing around (usually studs but I do have some dangling ones) so I just forget about them. I can't remember ever even noticing them after the first few months. I think it's just habit. I almost never wear makeup so putting on mascara or gloss will make me very very aware of the fact that I have something on my skin all day, but earrings I just forget.	I'm a jeweler, so I make all of my own jewelry. One of my goals when making a piece is to make sure that it's comfortable :) so the earrings I wear every day are super easy to sleep in, wear hats with, work with etc. and I basically kind of forget that they're in!	1
Pet Owners: What are some silly quirks your little friends have?	My boy cat likes to eat his dry food by picking it out of the bowl with his toes, one piece at a time. He also likes to pat my face when I cuddle him.	My tiny pitbull Harley Quinn has to pick up something everytime she's given a command, when she's excited, or a random moments. My other dog cookie likes to dig holes and stick her head then sniffs.	1
What is a product you wouldn’t think works but actually does?	Good dry shampoo. I always assumed it wouldn't do much to help my hair and I now know that was a dark, greasy-haired time in my life.	As naive as this probably sounds, a mousetrap. Until I was in college, I'd never needed a mousetrap before, but one day I suddenly needed one. I went to the drug store not knowing what I'd find, and the only option was the wood slab with a metal coil on it, like from an old cartoon. It didn't occur to me that that would still be an option, but I figured I might as well give it a try. It totally worked. Within ten minutes of setting it down with a glob of peanut butter on it, SNAP! The mouse was dead within 30 seconds. I salute you, inventor of the old-timey mousetrap, whomever you are. No one has bested you yet.	1
What was your "wow, I really don't give a fuck anymore" moment?	I watch a lot of movies (>3 a month). Before I used to make plans to see them with people. It was such a fucking hassle and people kept showing up late but its a big fucking deal for a 2-2.5 hour movie. So i stopped asking people and started going to movies by myself. One of the weirdest best decisions i ever made. Super liberating, i enjoy myself more, i can go anytime and get on with my day.	Mine is going to be boring, because this is reddit, and reddit is flooded with trans women, but when I realized I could never fit cis-norms and said, eh, whatevs. Not that this fixes physical dysphorias, it doesn't, but it certainly makes going out the door easier when I don't care if you know I'm trans or not. And honestly, I've come to like (love?) being trans because as a gender pariah, I have the freedom of a pariah. I'm damned either way, so I might as well choose my personal happiness 100% then - not a freedom many have in life.	1
Do you rid yourself of the hair above your lip or just live with it? Why?	I wax it off when it starts getting long enough to notice in the mirror (as long as I notice it on a Friday so my skin has the whole weekend to recover before work on Monday morning. I don't like my stache so I get rid of it. Plus, I work in a high school and, even though I shouldn't be, I'm still very worried about students making fun of me for various other reasons. If I can do away with one small reason, I feel better. If I liked my stache more on my own, I wouldn't wax it just for my students, though.	I don't "just live with it", I live my life and happen to have hair on my upper lip while doing it. No one cares. Reading all of the comments here made me really sad.	1
Women who have the time to prepare breakfast, workout and read all in the same day, how do you even do it?	I don't have kids or a SO. Every moment not at work is a moment I can do whatever I want.	Wake up earlier. Beyond that, it really comes down to utilizing time well. I watch a lot of TV, but on the treadmill, or workout while I do so. I plan my 25 hours really specifically so that I have time for everything that I want to do	1
How do you feel about the "Me Too" posts trending on social media?	I question my own experiences compared with other women... I guess I don't know if my experiences are "enough" to speak on publicly. I have never been assaulted but of course have experienced instances of leering glances and catcalling. I guess I feel as though my participation would trivialize the posts of others who have faced so much more, so I am uncomfortable participating.	I wrote and posted the following in response on my Facebook this morning. It is the sum of my feelings about it. Feel free to take and repost: "Everyone knows that women are sexually harassed and assaulted. Women aren't the ones who need to come out of the shadows on this issue. Men are. And by shining the light on women and celebrating their fight, we make it safe for the male perpetrators to remain in the shadows. How about the men who are responsible start standing up and identifying themselves by posting "I did". Copy and paste this to see if anyone you know is brave enough to come into the light to stop sexual assault."	1
What unfortunate character trait can be traced back directly to something in your past?	I was taught to reject traditional gender roles and to look down on them, and as a result I’m not just bad at cooking and cleaning, it literally makes me angry. It’s really unfortunate because those are life skills.	I'm very very big on keeping secrets, and I sometimes structure my life so that I have at least one secret to keep at all times. My parents didn't believe in privacy. I'm 24, and I still live at home, and I was only allowed to start closing my bedroom door earlier this year. When I was a kid, my mother would go through my room to find my diaries, and then read them and punish me for what was in them. She would empty out my backpack once a month or so and read every single paper that was in there. I had to get very good at maintaining separate lives at school and at home, but the result is that I keep even mundane secrets from everyone, just to feel like there's a part of my life that belongs to me.	0
Women of Reddit who did not go to college: What is your job? Are you struggling to make ends meet?	Well I do have a degree and I'm currently working a $12 an hour job. So be happy you at least don't have loans to pay too. I did have a job as a nanny where I made $20 an hour.	If you like babies/kids - be a nanny! I did go to college for 5 semesters, but I dropped out due to finances. And because of that- my transcript has been on hold til I can pay 30k 🙃🙃🙃 I’m a full time nanny/housekeeper and I love it. I make between $15-16 an hour after taxes are taken out. I wish I made more and had a degree obviously, but I like what I do and live alone without trouble paying my bills. And living in the heart of Dallas with a fairly high cost of living, that’s saying something. IMO. Just throwin it out there ! :)	0
Who's the worst roommate you've had, and why were they awful?	She walked around butt naked all the time and we were the only two people living in our apartment and she would eat my food and then deny that she ate it	A really nice girl from India who never cleaned up and would leave the kitchen a mess and the house smelling like Indian food all the time. She would wake up at 3am to start cooking and the process would continue most of the day. Took over the fridge and most cupboard space. Had an alter with food on it. House guests for weeks at a time. Also everything was vegetarian and didn't taste good to me personally so I would never eat anything and she would still make way too much then store it until it was rotting and still leave it long past rotting. I would clean the kitchen after work and wake up to another mess when I woke up, it was endless. She would not eat food she didn't cook so I could never go 24 hours without the Indian food problems.	1
What's the grossest thing you and your SO have done together?	Having sex on the top of a mountain after hiking in Colorado. The only gross part was not having anything to clean up with.	He bit off my hang nail once because I was driving and needed it off immediately but I was not trying to mess up my lipstick so I couldn’t do it myself	0
Women of Reddit who have had abortions in a committed relationship, how did it affect the relationships between you and your SO?	In the last 3 years I have had 2 abortions and one baby (yay!) with my current partner. They went abortion, baby, abortion. He is Catholic and is not a fan, but is also progressive and believes my body (and everyones body) is not his to dictate. He did not feel good about either abortion, but he loves me and respects me and my choices. He was sad and a little distant after each one, but I let him be and tried to respect his feelings. I guess this was mostly easy for me bc I felt very confident about my decision each time and I dont have a lot of hang ups about abortion in general, so I didnt really need a lot of support from him. It took some time (a couple of weeks) but he moved on and we are great!	We weren't ready for it. We both agreed we didn't want to be parents. The abortion was emotionally draining on us both, but it also brought us closer.	0
What's something that's super popular in your area, but basically unheard of in the rest of the world?	Not in a hipster way but Yorkshire puddings and crumpets. I honestly thought that any country that ate roast dinners on a Sunday would have Yorkshire puddings. Until I went to a carvery with some American friends and saw the "WTF?!" look on their faces. I think other places do crumpets but I'm not sure if they love them the same way we do. The excitement when "giant crumpets" were released by Warburtons was too real.	I don’t know that I have anything for my area. Maybe Starbucks or Seattle’s Best Coffee. They’re basically on every street corner and in every grocery store. Part of being in their home state. I’ve been to places that don’t have Starbucks or SB, only Dunkin Donuts, which pales in comparison. Or Jones Soda. Do other places have Jones Soda? And Voodoo Donuts. I know there’s one in Texas somewhere. But they’re pretty much only a PNW/Portland thing.	1
at point during dating is it appropriate to bake something for your date ?	Thanks for the input - yeah, I think my buddy just went in a little too strong without having a good read on how she felt. That’s the hard part.. reading how someone feels after one date!	I'm in pastry school so to me, it's never too early. That said, I wouldn't accept a baked good on the first or second date or anything.	0
Ladies who were bullied because of your looks, when was the first time you realized someone was genuinly attracted to you?	When I realised he was rock hard after a couple of minutes of making out... was an awesome moment I’ll never forget	I was 21. Suddenly men stared checking me out, flirting etc. like a switch had been flipped. No idea why or what it was due to, really. But it was confusing and even annoying. Go figure.	1
Woman, when was the last time you were truly angry with someone?	Someone I personally know? In May. When the guy I had a plan with did the exact same shit he did years ago and had the date we planned to have together with another woman and didn't even bother to tell me he changed his mind about our plan.	Yesterday, my friends deciding to go out with a man with a serious domestic violence, substance abuse and bad arrest history. She barely knows him but says he’s so much fun. It just bothers me so much because most victims don’t get these warning signs and she’s choosing to ignore them	0
Women of Reddit, what is your reaction to men who call themselves feminists?	Their deeds and actions matter far more to me that whether or not they declare themselves a feminist. If they act like a feminist and treat women as equal and respected humans, then they are fine by me. If their actions don't match their feminist label, then I won't be particularly impressed by them.	Its a good thing. Apart from the ones who go "feminist, as long as you understand its about equality for everyone." Fuck them.	1
What small change have you made that really improved your day to day life?	Got a kitten. Despite the upturn in small cuts and abrasions, he's soft and warm and his purring makes me really happy.	Taking birth control. Only get my periods about 2-3 times a year now. I don't understand how some women worry about that stuff every single month! Doesn't it get obnoxious?? It's free with my insurance and I'm lucky to not experience severe side effects so there's really no negatives for me.	1
When's the last time you went to urgent care or the ER? What happened?	I had a concussion for about a week and then it all of a sudden got really bad one day. Dizziness, extreme disorientation, migraine. Spent 4+ hours in the ER and over $400 worth of tests only to tell me I have a concussion and sent me home. Thanks, doc, I had no idea.	I was trying to sleep when I had this weird feeling on my left side. Felt a little discomfort and then it quickly turned to pain. It was gradually becoming worse to the point where even laying in the fetal position didn't help. Had my husband drive me to the ER where I then threw up because the pain was so bad. Kidney stones. I have never felt a pain so horrible. Luckily it happened Thursday evening/Friday morning because we left for the Dominican Republic that following Sunday.	0
How would the world be different if men could get pregnant too?	Men *can* get pregnant. Now, if people with penises could get pregnant, you'd see most of what other folks have been saying.	ABORTIONS FOR ALL. Abortion clinics everywhere. There will be no stigma. Using contraceptives will no longer be controversial. Funding will come in like a water fountain. There will be a crap ton more options for men. Childcare costs will probably skyrocket. At the very least, employers will probably have to pay for at least some of it. Mandatory paid parental leave?	0
What are some things that are really important to you when looking for a new apartment (or house) that aren't immediately obvious things to look out for?	Lots of windows and water that stays hot for a LONG time The current apartment I'm in; the water fricking stays warm for 12 minutes on a good day. I have thick long hair down to my butt crack. Needless to say 12 minutes does NOT suffice and most of showers no allll of my showers end cold.	Practice your commute to work! If you're "against" or "with" traffic, the sunrise/ sunset can make life hellish or much better! Also, make phone calls/ use your phone in each spot in the place to make sure you get service. I lived in a place where my phone didn't work and I had to sit on the outside steps to make phone calls - it was so so so beyond aggravating	0
What's the best horror movie you've watched? Why is it the best?	It’s cliche but the Shining is a horror masterpiece, beloved for a reason. It’s the kind of unsettling that creeps into your bones and lingers.	The original Halloween is pretty great. A classic. I like cabin fever a lot too, it's a good comedic horror film.	1
Why are so many questions directed to women here about relationships or partners?	Because they didn’t know /r/relationshipadvice existed and they have nothing else they can think of to talk to a woman about.	Because that's one of the few things that both men and women are involved in, in which a woman's unique perspective is unattainable to a man through experience.	0
Women who graduated with a degree in arts/social sciences, how did it turn out for you and what fields are you working in?	BA (hons) in fashion design. Am now a designer for a UK high street retailer. Ironically I never actually wanted to be a designer and was more interested in garment construction. Wouldn’t have it any other way now though.	Got a BA and MA in sociology. Still working on my PhD, while earning a living at a research institute. I love my job, but I'm really sick of classes and don't want to have to finish my degree. I think I could do ok sticking to the type of job I do now even if I drop out of my graduate program, but not having a PhD would really limit my upward mobility / options in general. So... struggling with that right now. I'm still incredibly interested in the subject matter. I love the project development and data collection phase. I just don't want to have to ever write another paper (and writing papers is a huge, seemingly inescapable part of it all).	0
What small change have you made in your life that's helped to make you into a better person?	Honestly I'm a man and this may seem slightly stupid but the smallest change in my life that's made me a better person was my first love from high school waltzing back into the picture and I've only just shared one encounter with her and it was a great night it was reminiscent, romantic in some ways, and overall truly heartwarming, been six years since we dated and thought I was truly over her and now after that night I have enough motivation for everything I want to accomplish in my life to motivate every other person around the world, the point of this silly story is to point out to you ladies that you all have a wonderful powerful magic that pushes us men passed the boundaries of will power and I am simply grateful for you all. That is all!	Don’t speak while a friend is talking to you about something serious, just wait, and when you think you’ve listened long enough to interject, wait some more. It made me more empathetic and a much better listener	0
What is the most immature way a SO has broken up with you?	Ghosted me. We both had the day off and were watching movies together at my place. He left to go get us lunch and never came back or called. This was before texting. I was freaked out thinking something awful had happened to him. Then the next day my best friend said she saw him at his workplace (he was a waiter) and he seemed totally fine.	Not a woman but my first real gf, think freshman year of high school, literally just showed up at a carnival we were supposed to meet at with a new guy. It defiantly threw me off considering we had been together for weeks and were hanging out the night before and made plans to go to the carnival together actually. She literally showed up with another guy with his arm around her and said, Sorry he's my bf now.	1
Women gamers, what kind of situations have you been in that made you wish you had kept your gender a secret?	So I don’t really play online games like MOBAs anymore after some bad experiences. Basically if people found out I was a girl, one of three things often happened: - one or more of my team would spend the whole game around me ‘protecting’ me like I was some high value target - some guys would just hang round me in the game like a weird form of flirting. Like I’d want to either date them or sleep with them. - If the other team found out I was a girl, some of them would stalk me for easy kills. Plus, if we lost it tended to be my fault! There were occasions where people would be like “she’s a girl.....cool” and play on. But what I described above happened enough to be annoying and off-putting.	Too often. I'm trans and my voice is not entirely masculine or feminine, and often when I speak on voice comms it gets mentioned. "Are you a chick or a dude?" etc. And I either tell them I'm a woman, and then the trans comments start, or I go silent and lose out on voice comms or people keep making a thing of it if I just ignore the question.	1
What podcasts do you listen to?	My Dad Wrote A Porno is hands-down the best thing to ever happen to me (sorry hubby). I have - legitimately - almost run off the road because of the tears streaming down my face as I'm laughing. Also My Favorite Murder.	I listen to Pod Save America, Lovett or Leave It, Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, StoryCorps, and Ask Me Another!	1
What do you folks think of the current Hollywood firestorm?	I have some hope that this trend of calling out sexual assault and harassment continues and in other career fields and the perpetrators are held responsible.	I guess it's good? But I don't think it's going to solve anything if industries keep being dominated by old boys' clubs that cover for each other. They need to make a rule that if a man is ousted from his job for sexual harassment, they need to replace him with a woman.	1
What made the worst party you’ve been to so bad?	I was invited to a classmate's bachelorette party. It turned out to be a Mary Kay "party" where we sat around listening to a woman try to sell us products. At least there was wine(EDIT: I should clarify, it was my wine, that I brought, because it was BYOB.)	It was last year's Halloween. It was just soooo boring. My husband's friend's wife planned it and invited a bunch of mis-matched personalities over. She decorated and made appetizers, but that's all she did for "fun". Because everyone was different, and 100% introverted, nobody wanted to talk. The host didn't have any entertainment for us - games, movies, music, etc. It was just a bunch of people huddled in different corners watching youtube on their phone. When I finally approached someone to talk to them, they just told me about how they didn't invite their girlfriend because she's so boring.	1
What's it like to be in a fullfilling romantic relationship?	The way I describe the feeling is that it feels like home. Especially after a couple years and past the honeymoon phase. It feels comfortable and safe.	I’ve had a lot of them but none that didn’t fade over time and eventually become an oppressive obligation. The nice parts are in the beginning before money and health and habits get in the way. Having someone to snuggle with and say nice things to you makes your day brighter- until that gets old	1
What actor or actress always seems to play the exact same person in all their movies?	Jesse Eisenberg. I don't ever feel like I'm watching a unique character. It's always just the same fast spoken, insecure, and annoying dude.	Al Pacino! Even when he doesn't play the same character he acts like the same character. Same facial expressions and all.	1
How often do you just relax and lounge around? Do you struggle with relaxation guilt? If so, how do you unlearn the 24/7 hustle?	I do. Like right now. And yes, I have intense relaxation guilt. I'm still sold on the 24/7 hustle. I really would rather end up semi-wealthy and be in at least the lower upper class if not higher. And I do good. I can rock an honest 100+ hr work with we ease, but... yeah, this is me right now, struggling to relax, knowing or feeling I should be striving in this moment, but not too.... >.< You spying on me through my webcam in this moment o.O ?????	Pretty much any time I am not at work or have social obligations. I am lazy as hell. My life pretty much centers around finding the balance between the maximum amount of comfort for the least amount of effort. I have my 9-5 job that pays my bills and gives me enough to have fun. I have no interest in the stress of working constantly. It's a big reason I am childfree. I need my downtime to stay sane and balanced. I cannot imagine being happy with every minute scheduled and accounted for. I am happiest when left to my own devices. I feel zero guilt for relaxing.	0
What is a time you have witnessed a secret blow up in everyone's faces?	I worked with a chick who had a boyfriend in another country LongDistance. so while she was in that she started dating my BIL, then the LD came to visit for a while and by some weird coincidence she got pregnant like a week before he came so when she pretended like it was his but went and got an abortion and continued this weird relationship with both of them... eventually the LD found out i think it was by some text or something she left open on her iphone which connected to her laptop and the guy was furious broke up with her treated her like shit afterwards.... I always thought he was a good guy and never deserved that but I couldn't tell him anything because then i'd have to deal with her every day at work...	My sister's multiple affairs came out when my dad was in the hospital. We were all sitting there for hours, and she kept getting different phone call "rings" in front of her then-husband. Then 'friend #1' stopped by, then 'friend #2' stops by... she was milking the 'my father is in the hospital' pity card and it backfired because all three showed up at the same time at the hospital.	0
Would you rather be ghosted or an honest but hurtful explanation?	Ghosted. I don’t need an explanation and I don’t care. If someone doesn’t like something they can leave at any time and I’m 100% fine with that. No drama and no need to feel awkward for either party. I’ve been ghosted many a time and I prefer it. Also, I’m a ghost-er. If I meet someone I feel the need to ghost on, it’s because I know that no matter how kind or gentle I am, they would never accept my reason for discontinuing a relationship and it would become a fight. I don’t have the energy for that and I disappear.	An honest, and helpful explanation with as little drama as possible. Painful is fine as long as it’s not done on purpose	0
Ladies, how do you stop yourself from crying during an argument or stressful situation?	As an angry-crier, I just find a way to exit the scenario saying among the lines of " I can't talk right now" so I can visibly calm down and regain my composure.	We as women should not have to hide our normal emotional reactions. If our brains are telling us to have a certain emotion. Then perceives that as crying to “feel” the rush of chemicals aka the feeling... then so be it. Arguments or stress are both perceived by the brain differently in everyone. Do not let any boyfriend, family member, friend, coworker, husband, etc make you feel wrong for showing emotions. It is not a manipulation, it is a normal bodily function brought on brain chemicals. A reaction of our higher brain function. Certain animals “cry” why not us? This what happens when you read a few philosophy chapters and get stoned an hour before bed. Seriously though, crying is normal and more people should let it out so to speak. Hugs!	1
Mothers of Reddit, what’s the funniest/stupidest reason that made you cry during pregnancy?	*Just FYI, not all mothers have experienced pregnancy, and not all who've experienced pregnancy are mothers. Sorry sorry, it's just a thing of mine.* Also, literal spilled milk. I was laughing at myself for crying, and my SO was laughing so hard that he was crying, too. It was the best and the worst.	I dropped my very last chicken nugget on the floor. My husband offered to buy me more and I cried harder bc “I can’t eat that many.” I was a mess.	0
Have you ever changed your mind on something you thought was a dealbreaker for you? What happened?	When I first started dating my dealbreakers were: must be vegan, must be feminist, must be Christian and must not want children. My partner had health issues that prevented him eating vegan, he's egalitarian rather than feminist, and he's Christian but not the right kind, so to speak. Eventually I stopped being vegan and stopped identifying as a feminist and deconverted from Christianity. So I guess you can say I broke all my dealbreakers on my own? We're still good on the no kids front though.	Not really a deal breaker for the relationship, but I always said I'd never move into a guy's place, he'd need to give up his apartment and we'd get "our" place. I currently live with it SO in a house he owns. What happened is I guess I got older, and met a great guy who had his shit together enough to buy a house. It was more or less move in or wait forever.	0
How is your start to the week?	My life is pointless and the start of my week has been no different. This morning I woke up a half hour before my alarm went off and my dog noticed. I guess he was cold because he crawled on me and fell asleep on my stomach/chest and then we slept like that the last half hour. So I guess something good happened.	My SO is sick. These past couple weeks had been crazy and expensive, and we're also moving next week. I started feeling a tingle in my throat and gargled salt water and it's not feeling too bad today? Hopefully it goes away.	1
is it OK to cuddle platonic friends ?	Is youre both straight women, yes. If you arent then of course not. Why give someone else the wrong idea? Why go outside of your relationship? Why put strain on someone else's.	Depends on the individuals involved. I have a very low threshold for physical contact from anyone I'm not related to or in a relationship with, so for me it would be a hard no.	0
Ladies who have kids: what is on your children's Christmas wish list? And are they going to get what they want?	Don't tell the Santa lie to start with and your kids wont have unrealistic expectations. Mine is 8. He knows Mommy will do what she can for presents. He is super appreciative and doesn't complain.	My kids are 2 and 3. We do “something you want, something you need, something to wear, something to read”. Saves us from spending a fortune. With all the gifts they get from other family, underneath the tree is still plenty full.	0
What’s something you’ve learnt about yourself only from being in a relationship?	That I have some hugely codependent tendencies fostered by mirroring the relationships my parents and sister have. Also, that I blossom and function better when I'm in a polyamorous relationship than a monogamous one because it helps prevent those codependent tendencies.	I’m clingy and I care too much. not in an overbearing way (at least I don’t think so/have never been told) but I want to hear from or see my person often and feel more easily disconnected when I don’t.	0
What TV Shows are everyone currently watching and how are they so far?	Mindhunter (a Netflix original) is so damn good. It takes place in the either the mid to late 70’s. The first season is out now, it has 10 episodes.	I’m switching between bloodline and agent carter. I’m on the last season of both. I wish there were more than 2 seasons of agent carter.	1
What are your best frugal living hacks?	Learn how to sew so you can repair clothes you already have instead of buying new ones if something develops a tear or a hole. Frozen vegetables and fruit have the same nutritional value but last longer and are generally a lot cheaper.	What I personally do Try to cut back on spending money for all things that don't make you happier. In holidays/with friends I don't care about money at all, it's amazing to share a great evening with steak&beers... Don't pay for public transport, chances of getting caught are ridiculously small and tickets are expensive. Don't eat out unless it's with friends. Sandwiches for lunch. Only eat meat when it's 50% off No mobile internet/cheap phone no TV (internet works just as well) Buy a Kindle/ebook reader. You can get basically all books for free online.	1
Girls in the US have been getting higher grades than boys at school and university for nearly a century Why Do you think that is?	Women are planners. As a majority we plan for our future where as most men do not look that forward. I planned my whole school life starting in 5th grade. My brother, only 3 years younger, hasn’t planned his school at all and now as a senior has been through 4 different high school being kicked out of 3 in the past 2 years.	My experience as a former educator and childcare worker: girls are more likely than boys to believe they need school to move forward/get ahead. Most of my work was with lower income and middle class students. The boys usually told me they planned to work with their dads/in their dad's industry, or go into the military, or go into sports. Often they do need school for these things long term, but they don't see that early on. Girls were more likely to have a career goal for which they felt they needed a degree and therefore needed good grades. Military and sports careers are sold to girls less often, and you still have less of a tradition in families of welcoming daughters to the "family business".	0
Ladies of Reddit, what new dating dealbreakers have you developed as the result of a failed relationship?	- If you don’t read, I can’t date you - Get a job, have a working car, and your own place - Don’t mansplain to me	He has to have his own close friends or family members. Being someone's only emotional support is way too exhausting.	0
Why do you think boy bands are huge with teen girls, but girl bands typically have not shared the same success with teen boys?	Because boy bands lyrics talks about how they just want an average girl who only has love which sort of connects with us Not the girl bands which is mostly about how cool they are	Because teen boys are not that into pop music. Girl bands and boy bands are musically not that different. Teen boys would not threaten their just developing man hood by openly enjoying girly pop music. No! They will want the hardest rock or the most gangsta rap. Also girl bands really are for women. The tagline of the Spice Girls was girl power.	1
Black Women of Reddit: What stereotype geared towards us do you hate the most?	the stereotype that our entire being is sassy and ghetto. Recently, I was at a friends for game night, we were playing Uno. I simply but jokingly was like “girl don’t look at my cards” and her entire family mimicked me but made it way more than it was like i had said “GURRRLLL DONT YOU BE LOOKIN AT MY CARDS” when that’s not how i said it... at all.	I'm angry. I'm sassy. I'm ghetto. I could be a thief. I'm loud. I'm unintelligent. I'm close minded. I'm spiritual. I'm "manly". The only one that's true for me is that I'm loud lol. And my GOD I hate the, "Wow! You speak very nice. You're eloquent". That's a backhanded compliment; they expected me to sound a certain way JUST because I'm black. =A=; The fuck dude.	1
Fellow White Collar Ladies. Since the start of your career have there been any behaviors that you've intentionally adopted, altered, or killed off completely while at work?	I stopped using the word “just” in my emails. Ex. ‘I’m just checking in; I just wanted to see; etc. It is unnecessarily passive and apologetic. And you will notice men never use the qualifier.	I went from owning my own business to working for a large corporation. I've learned that there is a whole lot of social expectations and games that have nothing to do with the work at hand. It's more about relationships than quality of work, sadly. I'm was very direct, and didn't fake smile. That was heavily frowned upon for the women in my office. So though I work with all men in my department, I'm the only one that has to put on a fake bubbly act. Really fucked up. An older woman told me to "suck it up, if I had to do it so do you, fair or not".	1
Are you afraid of marrying the "safe choice"? And if you already have, what is your life like now?	No. I think the person you marry should be "safe." Not safe as in boring or for the sake of marriage, but a person you're confident meets your needs, who makes you feel secure, and who you know is a compatible and worthy partner. That's what safe is to me.	Safe choice means to me a shitty sex life. This IS my fear, because I will cheat. Maybe someone can share their personal experience?	1
Ladies, what are some common misconceptions you had before having had sex for the first time that were proven to be untrue?	Definitely changes depending on the guy, but also depends on their mindset. If I'm horny, sometimes my D is ready for round two in like 5-10 minutes. Sometimes, I'm tired and he doesn't want to play. It's sad because you can't force a dick to be hard :/	I assumed semen would just be absorbed by the vagina (like lotion on skin?), rather than sit there and be at the mercy of gravity.	0
Those of you with pets you let sleep in the bed, what happens with them when you have sex?	The dog is puritanical when it comes to sex. If we start when she's on the bed, she looks at us with great disgust and leaves of her own accord. Otherwise we'd just ignore her. She's small and easy to ignore.	... What is sex? Oh, is that the thing I am suppose to do with the other adult that sleeps in my bed? I thought we were bedmates due to lack of empty rooms.	1
What has been the most awkward date you have been on? How did it end?	My first and only Tinder date when I was about 23. We jumped right into a movie date which was a bad idea since we never spoke on the phone (hardly knew the girl). She had NO reaction to the movie besides maybe a smile or two? We jumped into a dinner date right after. Figured she might open up more... Small talk at first then... I got lectured for 45 minutes about feminism and perverts. The most awkward date I've been on. To top it off, I even tried kissing her.	I was 14, he was 19. I thought we were going to hang out with a mutual friend. We did eventually meet up with that friend for what I later realized was a double-date lunch. It was mostly just hours of uncomfortable walking around town and sitting at the park (where he tried to feel up my leg). He asked me twice why I was "so tense". When he finally drove me home, I was so relieved. My mom answered the door and promptly invited him to join us for dinner. She even had dessert. We never fucking had dessert. I wanted to cry.	0
How fast did you develop feelings for your SO ?	It only took one date. Towards the end of out first date I knew I'd marry him. It'll be 23 years in a few days.	I met my current boyfriend right at the tail end of a shitty relationship with another guy. We were together and broke up and back together a lot. I really liked him (current SO) but was trying to salvage my relationship that was falling apart. He asked me out and it killed me when I had to tell him I had a boyfriend. He was from a different province, nothing like any guy I'd ever met before. I knew right away I wanted to know more about him. We were dating the next month. Very fast! I know. But we both fell so hard for each other. I know we're gonna get married and have babies together eventually. I guess when it's the right one you just know.	1
Favorite yoga pants or leggings?	I love the “Play” fabric leggings from Aerie, they come in lengths and some have big pockets on the sides, and the lining on the inside is like fleece! Super cozy.	Lululemon. I never understood the craze til I bought a pair. It's quite pricey but they're made very well. If anything goes wrong, you can easily exchange for a brand new pair. I have one that is 2.5 years old but still looks/wear like new. Bombshell Sportswear.	1
What are the things that make sex amazing (as opposed to 'meh') for you?	I think being with someone who wants you to enjoy yourself but also doesn't take it too seriously is the best, because I want them to care about my needs but also be able to laugh if things go wrong!	Superficial but honest- he’s got to have a hot body. It’s hard for me to get off with a dad bod	1
Do you have (a) male friend(s) who you have deep conversations with and who you are completely open to, but wouldnt be in a relationship with? Why not?	I met a guy in an online video game, we talked for over 4 years. I was in a relationship and he lived in Canada (me in the U.S.) We were very close and I liked him a lot, but the distance was just too much. Now i'm in Canada and we're engaged; don't ever settle for anything, happiness is always worth it!	I have no sexual attraction towards him, and there are parts of him I wouldn't want to see up-close in a relationship (not physical parts, parts of his personality). EDIT: Also, I'm surprised at this question in general (and I know this is a late edit, sorry, been thinking about it). My default isn't dating somebody, it's being friends with them. Dating indicates romantic and sexual interest on top of that. I can be perfectly compatible with somebody and still not want to date them.	0
What are your real life "Cat Person" stories?	I have a story I tell my friends about this guy I slept with from high school where after every fact I share I can follow it up with, “I should’ve just left” but I didn’t know how to say no. Thankfully he was a genuinely nice guy, it just was wrong chemically and physically and I chalk it up to a learning experience	The biggest one for me was a DJ who lived with his folks. He seemed so nice until it became obvious that his niceness was an act. An act put on way too srongly. When I brought him back to my place, he was cute and I did want to have sex but... It was not good. He treated me like a piece of meat, a "sex doll" , as the story put it. There was no emotion in the act other than this guy playing out a porno fantasy in his head. I was afraid to tell him that none of his efforts felt good. Because he didn't make me physically cum everywhere, (really not an important part of sex to me) he felt the need to apologize and torment himself relentlessly for hours about not being man enough. .. One of the most exhausting nights of my life.	0
How do you feel when you see your friends are gradually getting married?	Probably going to be an unpopular opinion here: I'm really happy for them but I also get envious and feel kind of left behind as I'm nowhere near that stage and a part of me wishes that I am.	To each their own. I enjoy my freedom too much to bind myself together too much. I love my current so but I just prefer the freedom to get up and leave without consequences if I felt like it.	1
Stolen from ask men: What is a something about your partner that you are able to tolerate but you are sure the majority of others wouldn't?	He makes terrible jokes. We’re talking sitcom Dad level puns. Usually I find it cute, but occasionally I wish the ground would swallow me whole out of embarrassment.	My hubs has anger problems and is very aggressive. For the most part he is not abusive with me or our son but at times we had have fights. We haven’t had a fight in over a year. It’s less intense now that we are both heavily medicated. But during our first year together I contemplated leaving several times. Aside from his anger isssues, he’s the person I have had the most compatibility ever: from musical taste to sex. He’s also my second husband, btw.	1
What have you experienced that was later explained by finding out you were pregnant?	I'm not sure it counts because I was actually on my way to buy a pregnancy test, but as I walked in the drugstore the smell of all the perfumes was too much. I threw up on their welcome mat - no warning, I couldn't even turn my head. I felt ridiculous buying the test, the cashier was looking at me like, You really don't need to buy this.	I've never been pregnant, but my cousin was, and I didn't know. For several months, my cousin was not ready to announce her pregnancy. Whenever we would go out, she stopped drinking wine with dinner, which we would always do. She also refused going out for sushi, which was a favorite of ours. She kept saying she had something to tell me but wasn't ready to do so. I thought she was going to say she was an alcoholic and was going into AA (she didn't seem like an alcoholic, but I don't know her personal habits). One night, she finally said she was going to tell me this secret of hers. As soon as she said, "I'm pregnant," I blurted out,"I'm so proud of you!" :P	1
Women whose SO practices a different religion - how do you celebrate the holidays?	I'm Jewish and he's Catholic, but neither of us are very religious. We light Hanukkah candles and have a Christmas tree (no angels or baby Jesus decorations). When we got together, I was so excited to celebrate a traditional Christmas with a feast on Xmas eve, and then I found out that his family doesn't cook and orders Chinese food instead! Such a disappointment.	the mitigating factor within the premise of the question itself is that if the two people are of different religions yet married (or stayed married) to each other, then they were probably not very religious to begin with, if at all really.	1
Have you ever had your hair cut against your will?	As a 14 year old girl, it would have been devastating. I know a guy whose mother would purposely overfeed him and his brother so they'd be "too fat to love"(Her actual words) and wouldn't leave her. With that kind of abuse it's not really about the act itself. It's the message that the act conveys which is "You do not control your body. I control your body."	>As a guy I cannot really relate much, so how traumatic would this be if it happened to you? I haven't had this happen. However, saying you can't relate is just a failure to empathize masked as a gendered thing. It's not about hair. I mean it's a little about hair. But mainly it's about autonomy and being told what you can and can't do with your body and how you express yourself.	1
Those who were called crazy by their ex, what's your story?	I told him assaulting someone is illegal and apparently that idea went against his politics (because the assailant was a god to him obviously) so I'm apparently both a nazi and a moron. Oh and the person who assaulted someone, ended up getting arrested for other things later. It's a shame really that party comes before morality. We had a generic, good friendship going until he freaked out like that. I think i got 2 posts in before he blocked me. Oh well. Lol no skin off my nose.	He wanted me to be emotionally and mentally unstable, because it was easier for him to control me that way, and control the way others viewed me and our relationship.	0
What is the creepiest "I stalked your Facebook" story you've heard?	In college MySpace was a thing. Huge. So all the students were on MySpace and I think I had a lot of ransoms added. One day a guy messaged me that he saw me in the school restaurant area. Turns out his apt wasn’t too far from mine too (same complex)	I went to a concert alone and spent the evening sitting at a table by myself. Didn't speak to a soul. Went home to a Facebook message (from a stranger) along the lines of "I saw you at the show tonight." NOPE.	0
What are your thoughts on OkCupid switching from usernames to legal names only?	Sounds like a great way to get most women to stop using their website. We already have to deal with enough creeps when just using a username.	I used OkC to meet my now-husband years ago, and I use it now to meet new people (open relationship). No way I'll continue to use it. Too fucking dangerous. I'll stick to Tinder, thank you very much.	1
What do you do when you’re by yourself that would make you look like a crazy person if someone saw?	I talk to myself like I am 2 people talking to each other arguing different sides of a problem. Basically like real life playing chess against yourself. I use we a lot for just me, I use us and our a lot. I have a big family and had a lot of friends in school but in large groups I feel alone because I talk above most people when I am not drunk. I get drunk to dumb myself down to average American social levels. I was teaching adults computers for money at age 11. I am a great public speaker and not shy at all. I feel awkward when others joke about something I talk about because they feel awkward knowing nothing on the subject.	When I daydream I get absurdly into it, So you could catch me talking to myself/emotionally reacting I also pace while I do it lmao So a crazy, pacing person talking to themselves and maybe even crying or laughing it's a movie in my head basically e: I'm honestly shook how many other people here do this lol thanks for responding ladies. I feel a lot less crazy 😁	0
Women who have seen their SO get hit on without their SO realizing what was happening, what’s your story?	We were at this bar that has a whole bunch of arcade games. I disappeared to go to the bathroom and this girl came up to him and started stroking my boyfriend's back and telling him how good he was at Shrek pinball. My boyfriend had a mild moment of panic because he's an awkward guy and is pretty socially anxious so he just straight up sped walked away to come find me.	Bartender at a local pub would only talk to and a acknowledge my boyfriend. Every time we went there she would ‘accidentally’ pour him the wrong beer and give him a free beer. Now she works at the same place as him and has said his butt looked good in his work pants. I’m not worried because she is quite literally built like and looks like a man, so my boyfriend wouldn’t be interested.	1
If your "one year ago self" met "current self," how would she feel?	She’d be happy. I’m down 35 lbs, I’ve got answers to my medical issues and on a treatment plan with a great medical team, and I am more focused on my myself than ever. Although I’d warn her that her Christmas is about to be shit so she should prepare herself for battle.	Annoyed/disappointed that I've done nothing with my year. It feels like 365 have just flown by and I've nothing to show for it. Although I started making candles in October and I wanna buy a saxophone next year so hopefully next year will be better. And I'll shift some weight.	1
What's your current trivial frustration that you can't vent about because it'll make you sound completely insufferable or like an asshole but it's really bothering you?	All the #metoo stuff makes me feel like absolute shit even though I’ve never really been sexually abused, nor to my knowledge abused others. I mean it’s good that it’s all coming to light now, but it is destroying my mental health.	The New York Times keeps breaking stories and publishing articles I want to read but I've already read too many this month and don't have a subscription.	0
Those that have had someone attempt to murder them - how did you get over it and what else happened as a result?	I had a guy stab me because I turned him down at a party. I am not sure if his intent was to actually kill me or if he was just attacking me for funsies without purpose. I still hate guys approaching me cold. I doubt I will ever get over it. What else happened? I had to go stay in the hospital and get my first GYN appt because I had a stomach wound which was possible to have affected my reproductive stuffs. Also, I was 14 when this happened.	The day he attacked me he swore if I ever survived he would track me down and kill me. And if he couldn't find me- he would find my family. Gun shamers need to do some research- or perhaps need to be better educated on them. Anyone without a gun is an automatic victim of circumstance. I'll always have a choice to fight- now my chances of winning are much higher.	1
Who did you think was "the one that got away", only to find out later they were a bullet you were lucky to dodge?	My first high school boyfriend. I moved out of state and broke up with him because I thought the distance was unfair to him, didn't realize at the time how emotionally manipulative and abusive he was. Was hung up on him forever because I really cared about him and how "I'd never find anyone who could love someone like me." He got another girl pregnant within a month of our break up, got into hard drugs, openly cheated on all of his next girlfriends and was accused of raping several girls before 22. Bullet dodged like fucking Neo.	My first boyfriend. I "cheated" on him (gave a blowjob to one of his friends before we got together officially, after we started texting). He called me a slut and God-knows-what. I was hurt and cried a lot. Looking at it later, he was a very lazy, spoiled, uneducated brat. He didn't have any ambitions or goals in love. Yes, I had strong feelings for him, but I was dumb back then as all teens.	1
What incorrect hygiene practice or belief annoys you the most?	A lot of the women in my family believe that showering/bathing/getting your body wet while on your period is a surefire way to ruin your uterus. ????????????	I don’t understand people who think just splashing water on their vulva and labia is cleaning it. Sweat, discharge and blood (periods) need soap. I’m not saying shove a bar of soap up your vag but a little soap and water will not kill you.	1
Black women of reddit, what has been your experience with criticism and judgement from the black community with dating outside of your race?	My best friend growing up was black of North African descent. When she dated a white guy, I remember this black male friend of hers flipping out and said black women should date only black men and black men can date anyone. This guy always spoke his mind without any worry of sounding hypocritical though.	I am a black woman, and I do not like it when I see hot black men with ugly fat white women. On the other hand, hot black women usually go out with hot white men, so no inequality there	1
Women who have been cheated on in previous relationships, how do you keep the anxiety of it happening in your new relationships away?	That if someone is shitty enough and they want to cheat, they're going to do it. It doesn't matter how good of a partner or how worried I am, or whether I try to prevent it, and at this point in my life that's not something I want to waste my energy on. I shouldn't have to police my partner's behavior to keep them from cheating on me or making me suspicious that they might, and if I did, they wouldn't be right for me anyways.	Since my ex I now use 'plates'(i.e. fuck buddies). I no longer care if any of those 'plates' cheat. Because it's an open relationship.	1
Ladies of AskWomen, who settled down with someone that had one of your major dealbreakers, what was that dealbreaker and how did you get past it or finally feel comfortable in that relationship?	One of my dealbreakers, after being married to a sports fanatic for 18 years was that I would never date someone who was really into sports. My current bf is a professional sports bettor, so as you can imagine, he watches sports constantly. The difference is that he doesn’t let it dictate our lives like my ex-husband did. If I want to do something or watch something else, he is always willing to oblige.	I’m the person who has the dealbreaking behavior. He likes my privates shaved but I stopped shaving my privates a few years ago. I sometimes trim, though (usually when he wants to give me oral).	1
The year is over! What small change or simple habit did you discover in 2017 that was life-changing?	I gave up carbs. I started it as a weight loss effort,and it worked (lost 56 pounds) but it ended as more than that. My migraines have almost stopped, I went from at least 1 a week to 1 in the past six months. My skin is much better and my energy level is so high I work out 4-5 times a week! It has downfalls of course like it can be more challenging to eat out, or hard to go to events like weddings without a good amount of planning. But it is so worth it! Also got a squatty potty. I strongly suggest it to everyone.	I started to bring my lunch to work due to the need of saving money. At the end of the year, I lost about 40lbs so Im pretty grateful for that.	0
Have you ever had a friend develop extremist views? How did you handle it?	I'm not sure if this counts because it isn't what we all generally think of as extremist buuut... One of my close friends from college has gotten *extremely* into astrology and the like. I don't give a shit what you believe for the most part but she cannot think outside the context of what planets are aligned or whatever, and it's gotten so bad that I cannot handle more than a 5 minute conversation with her. I feel bad because she's a good person but it's like her personality is now in this little box!	Yeah, I’ve had a few go SJW and a few go in the other direction. Not a fan of either camp, but the former especially can’t seem to have normal interactions without making it into some sort of exercise in politics. We don’t speak much anymore beyond a social media “Happy Birthday.”	1
What would people be surprised to know you’re NOT into?	Talking about babies. As a woman, in a very male-orientated industry I find it annoying when I meet a guy for ~~a~~ the first time at work and their words 90% of the time are 'Do you have children'. No I don't, and I find discussing my fertility really personal	Travelling. I find it more stressful than my job and less fun than a quiet weekend at home, so I just don't do it any more.	0
What do you wish people would stop joking about?	I think anything can potentially be joked about, but it requires an amount of finesse that most people don't have. At any rate, above all, people should just know their audience.	We are already wound too tight as a society. Everyone should lighten up and quit taking shit so seriously. I think people should joke more and about more things.	1
Ladies, what is the best and/or worst response you've received when making the first move?	I invited a guy over when my dad was out of town (I was about 16) and had 2 friends over as well. The dude and I had been talking for awhile and I figured this was the perfect time to "get" with him. He comes over, we're in my room, things start to happen, and then he just stops. I asks what's wrong, he says "I can only have sex with girls I really care about". Wow, ok, well that's fine I guess, we'll just hang out. He leaves my room and sees that my dad has the computer game he likes. He says "OMG you have Farcry? Is it cool if I play?" Basically he came over under the pretense of sex, ended up playing on my dad's computer all night. :(	Tried to kiss him, he moved coz he thought I was going to tell him something (we were somewhere very loud), ended up kissing his ear! It went no further	0
Women who have/had violent fathers, how do you think this has effected your relationships with men, particularly romantic relationships?	I'm afraid of them. Honestly, I don't trust them easily. I'm aware that the fear is irrational but it's lead to me being distant and cold to men. Especially whenever a man takes in interest in me. I wish I wasn't like this, because I've ruined a lot of would be relationships because of how cold I can be. I hate that I've hurt their feelings; I just doing know how to deal with men.	I don’t think it affected me at all tbh. I don’t like assholes. If a guy is rude or loud I stay away from them because they’re unpleasant. I don’t like when guys get loud in general. When my boyfriend screams at his video games (the only time he ever yells) it makes me jump and get panic-y and a little angry too.	1
What's the best/worst treatment you've received at a hospital or GP?	Worst was probably when I was in the ER for severe dehydration after a bout of food poisoning. I was getting IV fluids. The nurse said they needed to do a pregnancy test. I told her I can't get pregnant, but she said they had to do it anyway. I was dehydrated and had only been hooked up to a bag of fluid for about 10 minutes ... I couldn't pee (yet anyway). I told her I couldn't go yet and *she threatened to catheterize me* if I couldn't give her a urine sample.	When I was in labor with my 2nd child, the nurse who was with me during the delivery of my 1st child years before remembered me and stayed thru her shift just to be there for the birth of my 2nd child. I was so touched, I will never forget that.	0
How far have you seen someone’s desperation for sex or a relationship take them?	My best friend is in a relationship with a man that gives her so little thought that he *forgot to buy her a Christmas present.* They live together and had their third anniversary in September. He bought everyone else in his life thoughtful, expensive (!) presents. He just...forgot her. He told her that, the day before Christmas. She had the perfect gift under the tree for him and he came clean and told her that he hadn't remembered to buy her a gift, and suggested that she make an Amazon list. I hate him so much for making her feel so insignificant, but she loves him still.	Are we including mass shootings or only stuff from people we know personally? Cause if news stories count, it’s mass shootings.	1
What are your most fun at home date ideas?	We make popcorn before a movie on the couch..... Then we cuddle a lot because our new couch is awesome. Also my new blanket is awesome. The cats are not awesome, though, and try to lay on the blanket.	Learn a skill or do a craft together. My fiancé and I aren’t terribly artistically inclined, but we like to go to craft stores and get packaged projects to do. We made a mosaic stepping stone, painted coffee cups, and etched beer mugs and wine glasses. I taught him how to crochet once, and we both tried sewing together.	0
When did you have your first kiss?	It was on my first real date which was a month before my 27th birthday. Edited to include: *LATE BLOOMERS, YOU ARE NOT ALONE*	I was like 19? Turns out kissing is really gross, I'm a bit of a germaphobe, and I never want to do it again 🤷‍♀️	1
Ladies, has anyone dropped everything and moved far away on a whim? If so, how did it turn out?	Hey there! I got a teaching job in England and my hubby and I left both our jobs and moved from Alberta to Cambridge for 9 months. The visa process was pretty smooth. Opening a bank account and apartment hunting was interesting and a bit stressful. We found the first two weeks were pretty stressful with trying to make everything perfect. But after that we got settled, made friends, and traveled... a lot! I would give it a go! Good luck :)	Just booked a one way flight for the end of the month! A little nervous but more excited than anything. I'm leaving behind an awesome roomate/bff, parents, and a good but new relationship. I feel like I need this change and my main motivations were frustration with my decent paying but dead-end job and my love for traveling.	1
What do you continue guiltily doing even though you know it's bad for you/the environment/other people/animals?	Long showers. Particularly when I'm feeling anxious, or had a bad day, or have things I need to think through, there is nothing like a long, hot shower. I've gotten at least somewhat better-there were times in high school when I sed to take two a day.	Eat beef. I don't feel guilty about eating meat but I do feel guilty about eating beef although I do it like couple times a month and in small amount, still. EDIT: I should have written I don't feel guilty about eating meat *for the environment*. I don't feel comfortable eating any meat, the beef gives extra guilt.	1
Women who have relied on food donations during their lives, what would you have liked to receive? What would you beg people not to donate?	I’m a social worker. I hate to see junk food donated to my clients. What I’d like to see are a good variety of nutritious basics that appeal to most people: fresh fruits, fresh or frozen vegetables, whole grain bread, protein and dairy, reasonably healthy snacks like whole grain crackers. Basically, if it would pass WIC standards it’s good, if not, please don’t force people living in poverty into a slow death and compromised health by donating food with little to no nutrition.	donate money to food banks, then they can get what they need. Most food banks buy bulk at wholesale prices, so even if you give food they need, chances are the foodbank can get more food from your donation if you donate cash. If you donate food and it's not what the foodbank needs, they must sell it (probably very cheaply) and use the money to buy something else, again your money goes further if you just donate money.	0
Domestic abuse situations are often characterized by the abuser being perfect, charming, and loving at the beginning of the relationship. What are some red flags to watch out for at the start of a new relationship?	If they get jealous of pets and children. Ex would get mad if I cuddled my cat when he was over because it was "our time." Also got jealous of the kids I worked with. One kid would give me lots of hugs and he hated that. I understand not liking kids, but being jealous of a five year old is a bit weird.	I've always followed this rule: Watch how they treat the elderly, children, animals, and waitstaff. If animals, the elderly, and children seem to not like them, then there might be something you're just not noticing.	1
[Serious] How do you cope with being relatively physically unattractive?	Besides the obvious (lose weight, work on yourself), realize that while the majority of people might not find you conventionally attractive, some people do. If there is something about your appearance that you hate but can be fixed (weight, teeth, hair), figure out ways to fix it. You need to be happy with yourself but not for anyone else. Wear the kind of makeup you want to wear. Realize that people are way too invested in themselves to worry too much about you. The ones who DO focus on your issues are paranoid themselves about what others think.	Pretty enough to get noticed but not pretty enough to get a guy to ask me out. Mostly a high school dilemma, thankfully. I just cried and hoped someone would find me attractive enough one day. Good news, it happened. Happily in a relationship with a guy who thinks I’m prettiest. To the point where we’ve stopped prettying up for each other unless we’re going out together.	1
Have you ever gotten an unexplainable, sleazy vibe from a man who, by all accounts, is well-respected and likable to others? What was your experience like?	Harry Weinstein Olympic Gymnastic Coaches Donald Trump U.S. Politicians Professional Football Players Employers Teachers Educators NFL Coaches Youth Sports Coaches Various Medical Doctors Church Staff Relatives Acquaintances I haven't experienced sexual abuse. We know from the examples above that it always starts with grooming.	Years ago when I was in college, I started a summer job where I worked with a wide array of people. There was one older man who everyone talked about him affectionately, but he just gave me the creeps. He would go out of his way to find me and talk to me on his shift, give strange looks, and offer to walk me to my car at night. Turns out...he was just a really nice older man who liked to talk was very awkward. I finally saw him talking to a group of people and turns out he wasn’t picking up on any social cues, male or female. I really saw how wrong I was about him when I met his wife of 35ish years! She brought him his lunch one night when he forgot it...two awkward and talkative peas in a pod!	0
What is the most unusual kink that someone you dated revealed to you?	Had a girlfriend constantly asking to peg me. I told her to fuck off and she wasn't happy so we ended that shit then and there.	My girlfriend had kind of an odd fixation on lactation for a while. Did all kinds of stuff like take herbal supplements and changed her diet to try to cause her to lactate without getting pregnant. Never worked and she eventually dropped it.	0
How physically attracted are you to your current partner?	We've only been dating a month so maybe I have rose colored glass on. But I am insanely physically attracted to him. Exactly my type! Very athletic and very handsome! A large majority of my past boyfriends or men that I've dated were just alright and I never had the insane need to pounce on them. Not with this guy! Hope these rose colored glasses never come off.	I'm ridiculously attracted to him and I have been since the first time we met. I always want to be touching him.	0
What do you ladies think about the allegations against Aziz Ansari?	He's an asshole, not a rapist. I am interested in finding out if this is part of a pattern of disgusting behavior, or an isolated incident.	She was brave to share her story with the entire world and will undoubtedly be shamed, harrassed, and victim blamed. He ignored her nonverbal cues and treated her basically like a peice of meat. When he realized she wanted to be treated with dignity and respect by her VERBALLY INDICATING HER BEING UNCOMFORTABLE, what did he do? Apologize and get her a cab? No, he poured more alcohol. Just because he pretends to be a "woke" celebrity doesn't give him a pass. He should be marked as a Sexual Predator along with the likes of Louis CK and Harvey Weinstein.	1
What is the biggest personality change you've seen someone go through?	My highschool friend comes in my mind. While his mom was still married to his asshole dad he was kind of awkward, quiet, and a bit mean. When his parents divorced, he became more relaxed, confident, fun, and witty. It was a great change. I hope he is still doing great.	a few years ago, my friend became a druggie, and became a major piece of ----. she became the biggest, most disrespectful ---- I ever met. she was in disbelief when I ended the friendship.	1
I accidentally bought scented tampons. What products are you surprised still exist?	Can you not dip the scented tampons in green food due and make them in to the tree air fresheners you see in cars?	I bought scented tampons once. I didn't notice they were scented, and in fact didn't even know scented tampons existed. So when I pulled one out of my vag and the perfume mixed with the period smell, it smelled exactly like rotten meat - bloody, and sickly sweet. I was half convinced I had some sort of infection, until I realized what the smell was.	0
Men of AskWomen, what brings you to this sub and what is the most interesting thing you learned about women?	It's a great way to find out what women like/dislike, and to dispel common stereotypes. One thing that's not so great about being male on this sub is dissenting opinions from men are often deleted by the mods, which never happens on /r/AskMen	Why I'm here: I'm pretty shy irl, so this sub has given me some healthy perspectives on women and answered some questions I'm not able to get elsewhere. What I've learned: Think before I say something/offer an opinion where it's not warranted, it's not always my fault if she pulls away and chasing won't help	0
What was the worst betrayal you have experienced from a non-romantic relationship?	My parents repeatedly created situations where my mom would have to choose between my dad and her kids and she always, always chose my dad. Memorable examples include when my mom kicked us all out of the house (ages 16, 15, and two two-year-olds) because the toddlers were crying and she didn't want dad to hear it, and another recently when she told my sister to keep quiet about being sexually assaulted by our brother in law because my dad thinks it was a one-time mistake and there's no use in hurting our other sister.	Found out my best friend was going to spend New year's Eve with her another friend instead of me and it did hurt me a lot, because it was the last New year's Eve I was spending in the city we lived in together before moving away. And what did hurt even more was that she didn't see what's the problem. It was 7 years ago, today we're actually not friends anymore and she sometimes asks and wonders what's happened - well, if she wasn't such a shitty friend and didn't disappoint me like hundred times, then we would still be friends. Some people are not worth your friendship.	1
What things should be kept in mind when arguing with your SO?	Guy here. She puts my dick in her mouth, so I'm always cognizant of the fact that she could bite it off.	It helps me to remember we're on the same team fighting the same problem. Then we're not fighting with each other so much as brainstorming how to fight the problem together.	0
Married women, what is your greatest wedding regret?	Giving in to family pressure to have an actual wedding. I wanted to do court just us or elope. It turned into a court ceremony with families and a huge reception and I had the worst panic attack of my life at the reception and stayed in my friends car for more than half the time.	Cheaping out on many things, but most importantly cheaping out on photographer. A friend with a good camera swore she’s a good photographer. We ended up with like 5 in focus photos. Not even great photos, but non-blurry photos. We ended up dressing up again the weekend after and took a dozen way better photos ourselves with a tripod, a windshield reflector, and three ikea lamps so we have something to send to relatives.	0
What did you expect to change as you became an adult, and it didn't?	I thought acne would no longer be a thing and I’d have miraculously clear, beautiful skin for the rest of my life. Nope, gotta religiously use Stridex every other day otherwise all hell breaks loose on my face.	I expected to start magically knowing all the answers and what to do when starting to become an adult, just like all the adults around me seemed to do. What I realized was that not only does it not magically happen because you need to work towards it, almost all of the adults I've always known and new ones I come across don't even know if they're doing this whole life thing right. It's all about appearances.	1
What tips do you have for making international travel and flights go as smooth as possible?	Wear slip on shoes. Dress for comfort, and in layers. Planes alternate between too hot, and too cold. Bring your charging cords, and a backup portable charger. Bring a couple things to do, I like to have my journal, a book, my Switch, and my podcasts handy. Not to mention movies downloaded to my phone if I don't care for the planes selections. Make a play list ahead of time. I do one misc and one for easy listening to help me sleep. I also use noise cancelling headphones, bc babies. Bring a water bottle, you can fill it after you get through TSA. It needs to be empty prior. Have your ticket and IDs handy. I also recommend those neck pillows.	If you're flying eastward, sleep on the plane. The jet lag is much worse going west to east than east to west.	1
what do you look for when visiting a potential romantic interest' home?	On my first date with my husband, when we curled up in his bed, the sheets smelled like they were freshly laundered. It's a small thing, but it made it that much better.	As a nerd girl. I want to see nerd stuff, I want to see your PC, I want to see your videogame collection, your media, comics, anything. I don't want to see this lifeless shell of a house. If it doesn't smell like a convention at the end of the weekend, I'm chill. I have no objections to posters without frames, wallscrolls, naked anime chicks, nothing like that. Because quite frankly, if I'm being invited to their house, I'm already interested in them.	1
You know that tangent you were about to go on in the middle of a conversation that would have totally derailed it but was a really good take, and you were kinda bummed you decided not to talk about it? What was that tangent?	How trump hamstringing federal bureaucracies isn’t the same as enacting good policy aimed at shrinking government. A better course of action, rather than unplanned budget freezes and 90% cuts is to ask for each organization to submit an efficiency plan with ways to cut their overhead. The people in those offices know where the waste is. Our government can be so much more efficient. Pulling the rug out from under them keeps them inefficient as well as ineffective. So don’t tell me you support Trump’s policies because it includes enacting said policies and “shrinking government bloat” needs to be done in a way that works. Slash and burn never works and that’s how companies go under.	My coworkers were discussing how funny it would be if someone in our industry (geoscience) was a flat earther. I wanted to talk about the guy who graduated first in my class in geological engineering who believed the earth was 4000 years old. I asked him about it once, his response was “God can make things seem older than they are.” Can’t argue with that.	0
What "normal thing" today (relating to women) will look shockingly regressive in 2050?	“Non verbal cues”. No one should be expected to read your mind when you don’t verbalize your thoughts. That’s complete insanity	Lack of adequate parental leave in a lot of countries (...the US). The expectation that mothers should take a very small amount of unpaid time off then just get back to work. Also the fact that mothers are seen as the primary caregiver of children by default always, because of being female - that mothers get time off because they're expected to be the primary caregiver but fathers do not.	0
What are some downsides of being conventionally attractive?	One things that’s been a major downside is jealousy, especially when it comes from family members or your best friends. I’ve had a plate of food thrown in my hair, called a “hoe”, bullied and gossiped about, and got blamed for another person’s relationship issues. I hate the feeling of knowing someone is envious of me because of my looks. It’s NOT my fault that a man is attracted to me. I’m not doing anything to cause it except for just being myself. I’ll catch myself downplaying my looks sometimes. For example, I’ll make self-depreciating jokes like, “oh it’s all make up” or “I’m not that thin lol”. Like, it sucks because I have great self esteem but I hate knowing someone feels bad about themselves because of me	People assume you aren’t smart. People assume you don’t have to work hard. People assume you like hearing things about your looks all the time. People don’t take the time to get to know you. People assume you’re shallow. People assume you’re judging other people by their looks.	0
Which female public figures do you admire and why?	Hillary Clinton. She's smart, passionate, and has worked diligently for human rights and the American public since she was young. She never gives up in the face of relentless bullying, and has held her head high throughout more bullshit than most of us will face in our lifetime. She's been demonized, but I'm pretty sure she'said going to go down in history as a tragedy of partisan politics.	Malala. Girl got shot IN THE FACE as a teen and was like “nah imma keep fighting for girls education, fuk u taliban”. But she even went on a talk show and said if a taliban member came up to her and was gonna kill her she would tell them that she even wants education for them and their children. That woman is incredible	0
Why do some people feel threatened by other people’s”Safe Spaces”?	I think it makes some people deeply uncomfortable to hear that someone's rape was so bad they can't read about it, or seeing graphic photos depicting any sort of violence or gore on campus can send someone to an emotionally dangerous place. I think some people can't understand, and think these people want to live in cloud la la land where they won't ever have to see these things again, but as we all know that's not accurate. I also think seeing emotional vulnerability to that degree and that public unnerves some people to the point they just feel anger or disgust.	I completely disagree with the idea of safe spaces, but I am not threatened by them. These seem to be common at colleges (only place I have heard of them). We are supposed to be preparing these young adults for the real world. And there are no safe spaces in the real world. Instead, what we are teaching them is that rather than develop your own convictions in who you are and what you believe, you should just run away to your safe space whenever somebody says something that you can't handle. The very idea that a stranger's words can evoke an emotional response that you can't control is a serious problem (for you) and needs to be addressed. And I think you will live a happier and healthier life once you learn to do this.	1
What's your partner's biggest flaw? Have you learned to accept it, or are you holding out hope they'll change?	He has a terrible temper. I haven't accepted it, but I'm also not holding out hope that he will change because he has changed and is changing, it's just been a process. It's one of those things that has always been a problem - it's a way his depression manifests. His parents were pretty terrible in terms of raising a challenging kid. It's genuinely amazing what a little Prozac and patience have accomplished.	He's a bit of a conversational bull in a China shop. Like, he starts talking and he just doesn't stop, it's impossible to shift the topic or insert an anecdote or segue to something else. He just keeps talking... everyone will be done with dinner and his food is cold because he can't stop. I thought maybe on our first date he was just a nervous talker, but this is how he is. He probably won't change, and I'm okay with it for the most part, because I can play pokemon while we walk and he talks. I've become a bit more forceful to engage with him and help others around him jump in and actually have a conversation rather than listen to a lecture.	0
Women of Reddit, have you experienced more slut-shaming or virgin/prude-shaming? How has each affected you differently?	I'm a prude, I've only had one sexual partner. Even so everyone takes the time to call me a slut or whore, especially my mom. This has made me believe I am a slut but over the years I've learned that it's not true. If I'd had been prude shamed I don't think I would have felt as bad about it because I'd see my body as still clean and pure. I wouldn't be able to take anyone seriously and I wouldn't want to deal with anyone who dislikes the fact that I take care of my body.	Probably prude shaming, I wasn't a virgin when I started real "adult" dating but I also wasn't interested in hookups or casual sex, nor was I interested in celibacy before marriage or someone deeply religious. I caught a lot of shit from guys who didn't understand that there's a middle ground. They usually decided to make fun of me for it, usually while we were making out. Because THAT'S what's gonna make me wanna have sex. Very little slut shaming sticks out in my mind other than an incident where an Evangelical woman told me I was probably going to get raped for wearing a tight t shirt.	0
What's the coolest thing you've seen in someone else's house that you'd never want in your own house?	A massive shower with two separate showerheads. SO is a waterhog and is not allowed to share showers with me until we get one.	A good friend of mine has this massive, round waterbed with satin sheets that revolves on this platform. It's really comfortable and I sleep like a baby in it but it always feels like the pizza delivery guy will turn up any minute in tiny cutoff denim shorts and ask who ordered the extra large sausage.	0
What are some dating/relationship issues you see guys worrying about in films and on TV that aren’t worth worrying about in reality?	Uhm, isn't that like *most* such "issues" in films & TV? I mean really, it's generally there for the entertainment value ... not reality (and "reality" TV is anything but), and generally not a documentary. Sure, there are *some* exceptions, ... but they're that - exceptions - not the rule. Heck, I'm sure there must be *some* examples, but I can't quickly think of, off-hand, any dating/relationship issue of some guy in a film or on TV that would actually be worth worrying about in reality.	1. The whole meeting the parents freak out, I get being nervous but the movies make it seem hilariously doomed. 2. The demanding promotion, there shouldn’t really be any issues with this, do these couples not talk about what they’re trying to do with their careers? 3. The hot ex- boyfriend you run into at a bar while out with her, there’s a reason he’s an ex. 4. The first time he cooks her dinner, there’s always a fire or something. 5. How things get serious all of a sudden. In my experience it’s usually a gradual thing and not a surprise to either party. You’re just plodding along taking the logical next step. 6. The proposal. If you’re that serious about each other the M word comes up a lot. You would normally know where she stands on it. If you don’t then you shouldn’t propose. Edit: your/you’re	0
Students and young professionals: do you ever feel overwhelmed, distracted, worried about spending your time doing the "right" things?	Constantly. I always feel guilty when I'm not studying, applying for jobs, networking, researching, etc. I do feel really great when I get home at the end of the day, tired from doing school work but it can be overwhelming if I don't take breaks. I learned to realize that I do better when I take some time to myself every day/week. It could be an hour a day or one day out of the weekend.	This happens to me constantly. I am 26 and I would say I am pretty successful in my career. I am worried about how productive I am all the time. This is not so much of a burden because my job actually make a me very happy and gives me a feeling of satisfaction. As I've grown, I have the feeling that I should prioritize relationships and health much more than what I have in the past. Particularly in the relationships aspect...I have friends and my family but I have never been in a relationship so it is something that I now feel must change. Not because I am incomplete or because I need a man to look after me.... just because I think a romanticrelationship is an important part of the development of a person and I have missed out all my life	1
What "trend" do you think gets more shit than it deserves?	Highlighter makeup. I love makeup and I’m a bit nutty about it when I want to doll up my face, but I can not for the life of me figure out highlighter and I figure it’s not for me in the end. With all due respect, I think it’s fine other young women wear it (do what pleases you!) but I come from a time where when I was in High School...no girl wanted a shiny face. Especially not myself. I don’t mean just oily either, because no one wants an oily face, but anything shimmery or shiny for makeup unless it was lip gloss was out of the question. I had friends who were constantly trying new powders and product suggestions just to reduce shine. So the trend of highlighting your face is not for me. For others, sure! Not me.	CHEVRON. I never knew that people hated it until I there was a thread about home decorating trends. It's so cute and I don't get why people hate it so passionately.	0
Who do you have a crush on at the moment?	I have a crush on my SO, but also on other people: A coworker at my last job tops the list, and I’m 100% certain it’s a mutual crush. We’re friends though, and though the mutual attraction is unspoken, we know where we stand. Our friendship goes through cycles of being hot and cold, so it’s for the best that I don’t see him on a daily basis anymore. Right now I have a fascination with my new coworker. It’s not a full out crush in the old school sense of blushing and butterflies, but he’s the one I’m always seeking out first and spending afternoon coffee breaks with. When the shininess wears off, I’m pretty sure this is a friendship crush.	A quiet guy I went to university with. He texts me randomly and we’ve met up (very) few times. He’s made it clear that he wants to get to know me but I’m not sure if it’s because he wants to be just friends. I might relocate for a new job so that would definitely stop our minimal relationship from growing. The struggles of being a shy person liking a shy person.	0
What decisions have you found easy to make, despite most people saying they should be difficult decisions?	I’d rather be single than with a guy who isn’t terrible, but isn’t great for me either; i.e., I’d rather be single than settle. My friend says that I’m a “strong, independent woman” because of this, but I really don’t feel like I’m making a difficult choice here. I don’t think I’m particularly confident or strong in other areas of life, I just genuinely don’t mind being single. I’ve dated “okay” guys and while it was hard for me to break it off because I don’t like to hurt other people’s feelings, I didn’t feel bad for myself and never questioned my decisions. On a related note, I don’t have a problem cutting out a toxic friend once I’ve realized the extent of the negative impact s/he is having in my life.	Sticking to a healthy diet and exercising. Eating unhealthy and being inactive makes me feel so bad. I don’t understand how it’s easy for people to live like that	1
Brides often say they want their bridesmaids to be able to wear their dress again. Have any of you ever actually worn a bridesmaid dress a second time?	I was a groomslady and wore a black dress. I removed the “sparkly” part and now wear it to funerals. It’s floor length and really nice, but I can’t see myself wearing it anywhere else.	Yeah. In another bride’s wedding. The brides didn’t know each other and happened to pick out the same dresses so I killed two birds with one dress. Other than that... lol no	0
AW, has an ex ever reached out to you years later? How did it go? What is your relationship like currently?	My ex reached out to me and we've been back together going on 7 years and 3years marriage. We've been off and on for about 19 years but still going strong and in love 😍. Marriage, relationships are hard you have every type of everything coming y'all's way especially when it's strong 💪🏼. Sometimes I feel like wow 😳 really, and then I feel like yes we're going to be alright. It's a lot of patience and dedication and the main thing loyalty. We couldn't of done it without our grand creator God ☺️	It was an amicable breakup and we now email catch up every few months, but I haven't seen him since. We invested a lot of time in one another so it's nice to learn how the other is turning out. We dated about 8 years ago and he reached out around the 5 year mark. I once reached out though, in a moment of guilt and stress, to an ex in attempt to apologize for everything that happened (at that time 4yrs in the past.). Was blocked instantly, 100% deserved.	0
Hairstylists/skincare specialists/makeup artists/nail artists of AskWomen, what can us customers do to make the most out of our visits with you?	Makeup artist: BRING INSPIRATION PICTURES! People often try to describe the look they want...totally wrong. You have no idea how many people tell me they absolutely do not want a smoky eye when really, they want a smoky eye. They just don't know know that a smoky eye doesn't have to be black and gray. Even if there's 25 pictures on pinterest that you like and you can't narrow it down to one definitive "this is what I want," it'll at least give the artist a general vibe of what you want. The most stressful thing is when someone says "I don't know, I just want to look dramatic but natural." Just have some pictures ready.	Last time I was at the doctor he told me when I’m at the hairdressers I should ask them to check moles on my head when my hair is wet. I’d never heard that before so I thought I’d add it here.	1
Do you think lottery winners should be allowed to remain anonymous?	No. The kidnappers work very hard to coordinate and carry out a snatch-and-grab, and to get a decent ransom in return. The lottery winner, by contrast, only has to buy a ticket and fill out some paperwork. It's totally one-sided in their favor!	There was a kidnaping and murder in Australia of the son of a lottery winner, Graeme Thorne. At the time the newspaper not only identified the winner but published his address. This case made very sure that lottery winners could remain anonymous in the future.	0
Why is there such a strong negative vibe against moms on reddit?	I thought it was simply due to the fact our generation is filled with people who do not want children. The type who have decided to not have children lean intellectual, and cerebral people flock to reddit for long form communication. Facebook and Twitter and what not are used very differently with the intent to share. Reddit is more internal. Thoughts alone. **edit** *Bless your hearts. I can't repeat myself anymore. "More people, more saturated views, more content on a website where cerebral people in general flock to share their unfiltered views." That is all. There's not even a viewpoint here and ya'll are losing your minds. Yeesh.*	I think part of the problem that hasn't been mentioned is that a lot of people hate child support and see it as 'women getting money from hard working men.' I encourage anyone outraged by paying child support to get a good lawyer, clean up their life (if necessary) and seek full custody. The answer to that is always 'The courts are biased against men, why even try?' If the mothers are with their children's father and not working full time, they are again viewed as leeches on men, as though raising children isn't hard work and high quality childcare isn't outrageously expensive. Reddit has twisted the narrative so that mothers have all the power and fathers have none. It's the anger of men who want to have sex and father children without personal consequences/responsibility.	0
What's something you're good at that no one knows?	My handwriting got made into a paid professional font a few years ago. Also, some doodles I drew. I get paid monthly and it's on cards, invitations, journaling stuff and all sorts of things. A fontographer saw my writing when I was servicing the car and she asked me to work with her in making a paid font. Only my mom knows.	I'm pretty decent at singing. I used to be part of the choir at school, and got leads etc. I just don't like to do it in front of people much.	1
What’s a self care thing you do that you swear by?	I made changing my sheets a happy event thing. Each Monday I change my sheets and do a pamper evening thing, with a facemask, a longgg shower with scrub, loads of lotions after. Have a nice drink,maybe do yoga. Then when I'm at the cleanest I'll ever be, I'll grab a fresh pair of pj's and go to bed early to enjoy some shows in my little cocoon of perfect.	Don’t have small children. Reading through the top comments I don’t have time for showers clean sheets and brushing my teeth. One day I will but not now.	1
Married Women of Reddit, whats your awkward proposal story?	I was 18 and we were on a seaside holliday, we go out for a walk along the beach and im looking at some seaguls playing, I turn around and he is on one knee, I was in complete shock. Then I notice he is purposing with an empty box? I intrupted with 'is there supposed to be a ring?' He looked shocked and paniked. It was so windy by the sea that the ring had been blown out of the box. I said yes anyways and then by some miricle we found it! He was pretty gutted that he had messed up the purposal for me but I diddnt care. Since then we moved to a bigger city togeather to attend univeristy, the wedding is in a few months time and ive just had our first baby. Couldnt of picked a better guy	We were in Vegas for a fun trip about 9 months after we met. Drunk me said, “We should probably get married while we’re here, eh?” Drunk him said, “Yeah!” Woke up in the morning and avoided eye contact for a while, took in the shark show at the Mandalay Bay. On our way back to our hotel, he just bursts out, “Well are we getting married today or not?” Yup, we are and we did.	0
Women aged 40 and/or above, what words of wisdom can you give women in their 20s?	Don't sleep around. In fact, if you're still a virgin, remain one until you're married or very, very sure. I wish I'd remained a virgin until I was 30.	Always be sure to be self sufficient, i.e., don't ever depend on anyone else to support you. Always have enough in the bank that, should it happen that you need to, you can restart your life. Also, treat yourself to some chocolate. That's important.	0
How do you choose to live your life differently than your parents?	By traveling! As much and as often as I can. My mom has started to come with me now that she is retired, which is awesome. My father doesn’t like to be more than 50 miles from home. And on another note, there are ways I wish I could be MORE like my parents - I hugely admire their patience, dedication, and how little they judge others.	I don't leave the wet sponge I used to wash the dishes in the sink sopping wet, because that's gross, mom! Wring. It. Out. That's how you get mold!	0
Those who married young and are still together, what’s your story?	I first got married at 20 but it was on/off for three years. A few months after the divorce was finalized, I married again (to someone who was a few weeks shy of 25). It’s been close to seven years and we are still together. He’s very happy but I’m not THAT happy despite is a problem he’s trying to fix (it’s related to his health).	I got accidentally knocked up at age 19 and we got married a little while after baby was born. He was not that young though, he was already established in his career, he's older than me. Honestly I don't know for sure why it worked, we weren't even really in love when we were hooking up, it's something that developed throughout the pregnancy. 20ish years later we're perfectly happy , I mean I wouldn't change a thing.	0
How old are you and what is the hardest life lesson you've learned so far?	24, sometimes you can do everything "right" in a friendship/relationship, and people will still not value you. Them not seeing your worth has nothing to do with you.	26, male - you should take the chances when someone shows interest in you, and don't back off for petty reasons that you make up in your head. Try it out first, you can always say no afterwards, but not before you have tried it - actually that goes for many things (but don't do drugs or other illegal business).	1
What are the most positive aspects of being a woman?	I guess people are less likely to consider me a threat? So when I ask for help people respond without any suspicion. Like when I got lost in an English town and had to get back to my hotel. My phone was out of battery and I was out of cash. I asked a man cleaning his garden for directions and explained that I was lost, and he told me to wait a bit and then brought his daughter out to drive me to the hotel. I could have been a bad person for all they knew, but I imagine me being a woman and Asian probably helped in this situation.	Being able to hide things in your vagina. I admit that sometimes I’ve wanted a little trinket in a store and was a bit overly cautious...	1
What do you wish you knew before starting therapy?	Make sure it’s a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy program. This program will give you the techniques to be successful. It is hard work but it will help you. Going and whining at someone once a week will not help you in the long run.	1. Be honest, share everything, do not censor yourself. 2. The work is done in between sessions, where you practice what you talked about, practice introspection, and work to change yourself. 3. Establish goals with the therapist. 4. It’s ok to choose a different therapist if you don’t have a great relationship with the therapist.	0
Ladies who dated in high school, what was your experience? What would you say to high school students who are in/want to be in relationships?	LPTs about dating: Only date guys who DO good things are ARE good natured. If he acts like an asshole, he is an asshole. Don’t make excuses for him like “I know he’s good inside” or “he could be such a great guy if...” Also, NEVER consider time in a relationship an investment. What I mean by this is, never say to yourself “but we’ve been together for one year and I don’t want to have to start over with someone else now.” Allow break ups to happen. At the time it may feel like you’ll never recover and that no one can understand what your going through, but you will, and most every person can understand and knows how hard a break up can feel. You are never alone.	Don't date in high school. Focus your energy on having FUN, new experiences, learning skills, and cultivating solid friendships (and planning your future!) If you decide to date, choose someone who shares your interests and have fun together. If you find yourself bogged down in emotional quagmires and fights, GTFO (by clearly and kindly telling the person it's over, not ghosting or being passive aggressive. Practice the difficult parts of relationships with civility). Never ever be afraid to say NO to anything. It's not rude.	1
Women of Reddit who have been successful in love, what would you tell your younger selves when you were single and feeling all alone in the world?	Dogs will give you the unconditional love that you're trying to get from a boyfriend and vibrators will give you the orgasms that you're trying to get from a boyfriend	Here’s some cliches that young me needed to hear: - Stop chasing people who are running from you. - stop trying to “save” people. Broken people will only break you - don’t set yourself on fire to keep others warm	0
Ladies who grew up during the 2000s, what makes you nostalgic about that time period?	I was born in 2000. I remember a lot of the music, Silly Bandz, Disney Channel Originals (Cheetah Girls and High School Musical), Webkinz, spaghetti strap tank tops and low rise jeans with rhinestones, and CD-ROM games.	I miss Neopets. I don't even remember the email I used for my account (it was my dad's), so my poor pets are probably starving. :( Oh! And listening to Hilary Duff songs on Radio Disney. I had all her CD's.	0
What's an academic or work related achievement you're really proud of but can't talk about?	I did pretty well last semester. I'm in law school so it's highly, highly competitive. It's all a curve so it all depends how well you do compared to the rest of the classmates vs. just knowing the material. (Everyone in law school knows all the basic material anyway) I don't want to talk about my grades because I know a lot of people didn't do well or as well as they'd hoped. Most people just want to be median but I made it way above median (like top ~20%.) I'm pretty happy about it but I don't want to brag in front of people who didn't do as well. EDIT: Btw, congratulations on graduating early! That's amazing!	Failing yoga. It’s the easiest course to take in highschool but i still managed to fail lmao. This is like legit one of my fave accomplishments from highschool. That and like having a great comeback from being hella depressed the year i failed a bunch of shit to gettjng straight a’s the next year ;p . But ya failing yoga.	1
Vegans, vegetarians, and women who don't eat very much meat, could you describe your average week in meals?	This week is pretty representative for me -- Breakfast: overnight oats, coffee Lunch: alternating between black bean soup and tofu/veg stir fry Dinner: will be different each day but probably salad, pasta with veggies or veggie burgers. Snacks: babybels, apples and PB, other fruits	I rarely eat breakfast which isn't a good thing. Lunch is a sandwich, wrap or sushi if I'm out and about. Dinner is some variation of chicken, salad and veges 95% of the time.	1
Cat owners, what has your experience been?	Mostly frustration and caving to their needs, the little assholes. Seriously: They're the best. My cats got fleas recently and it's been a really trying ordeal because it's a longterm problem and I've never dealt with it. Sometimes they are sick, sometimes they are super affectionate, sometimes they couldn't give less of a fuck about me. But I love them unconditionally. They're my cats and I'm their human. **Edit:** Y'all are flea experts and I love you all.	I love one of my cats, I tolerate the other. I treat them the same, but I regret getting the second one. She's moody and weird, something we chalk up to her being taken from her mom at 3 weeks old. If I believed in putting cats outside for good she'd probably be a permanently outdoor cat. She's gone outside for a couple days during the day at a stretch when she tore the shit out of my arm for no apparent reason. If she ever does that to my kids, though, she's gone for good. I can understand defensive scratching, if my kids mess with her and she scratches and runs, fine. She's the kind of cat who has a note on file at the vet's office for how unnecessarily aggressive she can be.	1
What is the moment you realized you were dating a keeper?	When I confided in him with my ROCD (a subset of Pure O), and he told me he wanted to help me work through it. We did, and much more quickly than I'd imagined! It had been a huge source of anxiety in the past, but he completely accepted me and put me at ease. I was so afraid of causing him pain with my doubts, but made me feel confident that wouldn't happen and I had to take a chance.	The night we "officially" started dating. We worked together and I was leaving my position. At this point we were just messing around, going for drinks every friday and promised each other "no feelings attached". That night we went to say good bye in the parking garage and both ended up crying our eyes out and saying I Love You for the first time. He gave me a gift to open when I got home (we thought we would never see each other again) and it was my favourite shirt of his, a bottle of the drink I had on our first work date together and the most beautiful card. Now we are 8 months away from our wedding day ❤	0
What are the habits you adopted that made you a healthier person?	Writing an affirmations on my mirror every day to remind myself of my strength, my worth isn't based on what others think, and I am not the sum of my mistakes. While you may not have been asking about mental health, it is just as important as physical health. When I show myself compassion, I make much healthier choices all around.	I'm really surprised at the amount of people here who count calories... Not all calories are the same. Edit: I realize the helpful impact of just looking at and critically evaluating what we eat! But calories specifically seems a bit much.	1
What are some signs that make you suspect someone ELSE'S relationship is on the rocks, or won't last much longer? Have you ever been wrong?	Reduced frequency of sex. When my boyfriend's other girlfriend gets harder to schedule and doesn't have sex with him on their dates when they do schedule things, I can guess that she's on her way out. Edit: have been right the last two times. The time before that is what taught me.	Going from an intense flood of social media photos together, to none, is usually a sign that things aren’t as happy behind the scenes.	0
Women with invisible disabilities, what do you wish other people knew about your daily life?	It’s hard to describe but sometimes it’s just that invisible disabilities make people TIRED. I have type 1 diabetes and I don’t even know how to sum it up other than by saying that I’m just tired. I’m always having hypoglycemic attacks and it just feels like it takes a toll physically and mentally. Edit: Elliott Smith also has a good line from his song on how things can get tough for people. “I'm here today and expected to stay on and on and on I'm tired I'm tired”	It really irks me to hear my coworkers complain about how bad their back pain is when they don't have any actual, severe issues. And trust me, I've asked them. I know back pain, y'all. I have a malformed spine, ribcage, and hip from untreated childhood scoliosis. I can't carry anything at all when it's cold because then I can't move from the intense pain. Or bend over in the cold because I won't be able to get back up. When it rains, my right ribcage and entire mid-back just aches. I'm pretty strong for a small woman, but damn does it hurt. The amount of painkillers I take every day is killing my stomach, and when I don't eat, people get worried because I'm already so small!! It all just sucks. I wish people knew that even carrying around a backpack, or just standing for too long freaking *hurts*.	1
What has been your worst fuckboy experience?	I have straight up stories about fuck boys, I could go on for days. I experienced this one fuck boy who had this crazy girlfriend. Like she was insane. She found out about me and started stalking me on multiple phone numbers and accounts. I was in Europe studying abroad and shed blow up my phone. She sent her brothers to come to my house and beat me up. After much interrogation her brother admitted it to me and started crying about how the both of them bully him to do things he doesn’t want to do. The fuck boy became obsessed with me and wouldn’t stop calling me long after we banged. Even when he was in jail he called me. I blocked him cuz I saw on the snap chat map at 4 am that he was driving to my house	We sat down at a restaurant on our first date and he told the waitress “She’ll have a double vodka tonic, and I’ll have a water.”	0
How long did you and your SO date before officially moving in together? What about sleeping over all the time/semi-living together?	Officially, we moved in together after 6 months. In reality, we did that almost immediately. We’d met at a party at my dorm complex, and ended up in my room. I actually expected it to be just a nice one night stand. But then he showed up the next day, and we went to his apartment to watch movies. Or have sex, with movies playing in the background. Then he caught the flu, so naturally, I visited him to nurse him back to health. Then my dorm was being renovated and they turned off the water, so I stayed at his place, to enjoy the working toilet. After 6 months, we felt that the rent for my dorm was money wasted, and I moved into his place officially. All in all, I spent maybe two weeks in that dorm after meeting him. We’ve been together for ten years now.	I moved across state lines to be with him after we had been dating for a week. It worked out until it didn’t. I don’t regret a thing.	1
Tall women of AskWomen, what are the pros and cons of being tall and how have they impacted your experience as a woman?	I’ve found guys to be intimidated by it. Even though I personally have no issue dating people shorter than me, I had an ex in particular who very much believed I would never go for him because he was shorter than me. I hear it constantly that guys wont date a girl taller than them even though I also hear men say women don’t like short guys? The only other con would be clothes, whether it’s pants, dresses, skirts, or shoes, good luck finding anything. It won’t be long enough or come in your size (I wear a size 11 shoe). Other than that, it’s just whatever. Makes some sports easier.	As an already tall teenage girl predicted to be 5’10-11, guys get intimidated. I’m bi though and girls don’t really. My current bf is 6’2 so we have a 5 inch height difference and it’s decent. I think guys are more intimidated by my intelligence etc than my height in the scheme of things.	1
Ladies, what’s your experience with getting a bikini wax?	Your significant other should do it. Free of charge minus the wax and those canvas paper sheet things and that lotion stuff. I'm just saying if their usually down their anyway. Best to make sure their not a one trick pony put him to work.It's just one more choir. You wouldn't pay to have your trash taken out(literally or a light bulb changed? Then again it is the 21st century. Maybe the lady at the STD clinic will throw it in when you buy a panel test?	It hurts but not as much as you think it will. It's fairly awkward making small talk with a woman you've just met staring at your vagina. I totally grudge paying money for pain.	0
Women with children, when did you think you would have your first child? When did you end up having your first child?	I thought I would have my first kid at 25. Hah. I didn't even have a partner at that point in my life. I ended up having my first when I was 32.	I figured around 25 is when I’d have my first, I wanted to get some kind of post secondary education done before and didn’t go to college straight out of high school. My SO and I found out I was pregnant in August at 22 just before starting an condensed program that turned a 2 year course into a 14 week course and I finished in December and I’ll be turning 23 just before my due date so it all kind of worked out.	1
Gaming women of reddit: do players act differently once they know your a Women?	Yes... one of the main reasons I don't use mic, have a gender ambiguous gamer tag, and play with my real life friends only on multiplayer. The few times I've used mic in game I immediately regretted it. Guys send you friend requests, say everything from "oh great now we're gonna lose" to "[my gamer tag] sounds hot".	Oh yes. I mostly play The Elder's Scrolls Online and GTA. In TESO, it doesn't really make any difference because a lot of women also play. But in GTA, it's different. I often get very popular, but some men get patriarcal. I've been told "Oh, that's little miss I know it all!" I've never been told stuff like that when they didn't know I was a woman. Other than that, it's cool. I guess it's because I'm good at it. If I was a beginner, I'm sure I would get a lot of gender insults.	1
Have you ever gotten “bad vibes” from a friend’s SO? Did you tell your friend? Were you ever proven right or wrong?	Yes, but I didn't say anything overt to her because I knew she wouldn't hear it. He ended up being a rank nasty creep who cheated on her (truly amazing that he managed to find two women to think he was worth giving even the time of day) and since she's moved on she's been really good about seeking perspectives on shitty behavior and actually doing something about it. I'm proud of her.	Pretty much exclusively. I've never met a friend's boyfriend or girlfriend that I've approved of. By like the fourth person, I stopped saying anything. I can only think of one time I was proven wrong. He wasn't a bad guy, he just wasn't right for her.	1
What's a TV/movie relationship that everyone thinks is great but you don't agree?	Tris and Four. There’s just a lot of manufactured drama. They were constantly mad at each other for who knows what, and then they’d make up, and two minutes later they were mad at each other again. But I was never a big fan of the books, particularly allegiant. I felt like it was all manufactured drama, so I suppose their relationship would be the same.	Walter White and whatever his wifes name was. I watched that show a long time ago, but I can remember hating on her so much, she was such a drag.	1
What relationship quote do you hate the most?	"Love will keep us together." No it won't - you need commitment, shared values, sacrifice, loyalty, so much more than just love.	“Maybe it was the right person, but the wrong time.” No. If it was the right person, you’d make the effort to be with each other.	1
What prized traits in men are hardest to find?	An old-fashioned gentleman who opens doors, buys me flowers and treats me like a lady. But with a modern belief system who sees me as an equal, respects my independence and who values my opinion. VERY hard to find in the south, but I got one! :)	Guys who don't say hurtful things out of anger. It'd be nice to find a guy who will express that they're angry and then take some time away before trying to hash it out. Guys who are kind to everyone. I was recently disappointed with a male friend who was so kind to me but such an asshole to girls he was hooking up with. I found it very hard to believe that he could be completely different	0
Will conditioner work as a substitute for shaving cream in a pinch? If not, what will?	I use a good soap. I buy handcrafted soaps that have a lot of good oils in them. I can't even remember the last time I bought shaving cream.	Yes! I use conditioner on my legs every time I shave them. Works great and leaves them silky soft. Saves a lot of money, too. Feel free to buy the cheapest conditioner you can find and you’ll only need about a dime size amount for each leg. I use shampoo on my underarms, though, because it does a great job of removing deodorant residue so it won’t clog your razor.	0
Women who can't have kids (whether you or your partner is the one who can't,) what is the most offensive thing someone has said to you?	I’ve never had anyone be offensive in their comments or questions to me but rather thoughtless questions. The question I get the most is, how many children do you have? In my reply, and knowing that my reply will get a reaction, I smile and say, I’m blessed with no children. Life is magnificent without children and Life is magnificent with children.	The most hurtful one (different than offensive) is "You'll never know real love unless you're a mother." I love my family immensely and it hurts to have people say that the love I am capable of is merely superficial and without depth. The most offensive one might have been an off-hand comment someone made to me about how men would never ultimately want a woman who can't get pregnant; they'd just cheat on her with a *real* woman. Yikes.	0
Ladies of Reddit, what are some societal norms you and your SO break because it makes both of you happy?	I currently am a stay at home mom, but we have this weird silent agreement where when we go out in public with the baby he is the care giver 98% of the time. It's mostly to give me a break, but he also loves how pissy looking the older generations get when they see him and not me.	PDA. Lots of it all the time. Not just handholding; full on making out in public, hands all over each other, etc.	1
What food does your grandma make that is incredibly delicious?	Aw, my grandma. My grandpa, her spouse, lover and partner of 60 years is dying this week. Everyone is gathered at their house except me because I have a young son to care for many states away. My grandma and grandpa were both fantastic cooks. My grandma did most of the cooking and my grandpa, the baking. He must've made his carrot cake 1000 times or more because it was requested by so many people at so many functions. But I remember my grandma's cheesecake too. She grew an beautiful, wild, amazing vegetable garden for years and used to cook from that. Her thanksgiving dinners were made completely from scratch. I remember her lobster dinners with particular fondness too. Yum. Good memories.	My grandma is dead, but she used to make the best potato salad. Her dressing was beyond superb, too. She used to make a pork roast on the top of the stove in a skillet with foil over the top of it. OMG it was like tender porkchops wrapped in crispy bacon covered in pepper. She was southern. They grew their own vegetables. Can you imagine? Organic vegetables my entire childhood fifty years ago.	1
Whats the most creepy thing a guy did while trying to be nice to you?	"Yeah I can grab you lunch .. if you give me head in return." Boyfriend at the time was coming over and told me he was already swinging by Chik Fil A and asked if I wanted anything.	Not the most creepy, but creepy still. he literally called me *m'lady* back in 2010....he also felt the need to "defend my honour" when another guy addressed me with "hey whats up" instead.	0
What is your ideal amount of sleep? How many hours do you actually get?	Minimum of 8, 10 is a good night sleep on days off Could easily sleep for like 12 hours if I've finished a night shift or am jetlagged lol My bf thinks I sleep too much lol, I probably do tbh but in the other hand I just really like sleep	Ideal, 8. I get 6 hours if I'm lucky. Every now and then I can manage to go back to sleep for another hour.	1
Currently having a full breakdown in an airport. What are your worst travel stories?	When I was 14 I went to Houston for a volleyball tournament. Our coach dropped us off at the wrong terminal 1.5 hours before our flight. So there were just 12 - 14 year old girls trying to figure out where to go in a huge airport by ourselves and hour before our flight. We made it but it was really close and it was awful.	I got stuck on a mountain in Iceland in a rental car. We had to call emergency rescue. It took them three hours to find us in brutal cold (reindeer were roaming past us for part of the time). Then another hour to get the car out of the snow it was stuck in. Then we had to follow them back to town (40km) and stay there for the night.	0
Who is the cheapest, stingiest or least generous person you know?	Probably me. I don't like spending money on "things". I like meaningful gifts, so I gift meaningfully. Sometimes that means a really cheap handmade gift, or something that made me think of you, but was a $10 gift. One year, I was broke and managed to ten people Christmas gifts for $80. I tried to be thoughtful and get things like a gift card to the movies ($25 for two people) for my sister and BIL with a note that I'd babysit for them that night.	My dad. Whenever we go out to eat he wants to bring my grandma so that she ends up paying for all of us. There have been multiple times that he's complained about things being too expensive even to our server a couple times as if they could do anything about it. But then he will order the most expensive thing on the menu for himself but of course he ignores that logic.	0
What is a flaw in your SO that you can overlook because you love them?	He looks at a comic or a meme or video or gif or whatever on his phone and then laughs and locks his phone and sets it down then DESCRIBES IT to whoever he’s with. JUST SHOW THEM THE THING. SHOW THEM. *THE THING.*	He is short, not shorter than me but I can’t wear heels around him which sucks but I overlook it	1
What cheap, healthy meals do you like to make on the regular?	Not a meal, but I like to snack on carrots. I buy them cheap, the really big ones in a 10lbs bag and cut them small, 2,3 carrots per day and snack all day at school (I take breaks though, to make sure I’m not turning orange:)	I mix one avacado with one can of tuna. Add black pepper. Tastes awesome and has a ton of protein and Omega fatty acids. Super quick and filling, great for a busy lifestyle. I personally prefer Skipjack tuna over all else.	0
What weird things do you do with your pets?	So one of my dogs is named Minnie. We sing the Biggie Smalls song to her but change the words - “Minnie, Minnie, Minnie can’t you see? Sometimes your snugs just hypnotize me. I just love your Minnie ways. Guess that’s why they’re broke and you’re MIN-AY. “	My cat stares out the front window, so I wave to him whenever I leave for work or the gym or whatever.	0
If you were to advise young girls on what to look out for in guys, what would some of the things be?	He needs to respect his parents, especially when they try to help him. He needs to respect your body, and when you say "no" it's your word, not his. He needs to respect your money, and realize it's your money not the whole "our" money. And only is the "our" money acceptable when both of you make an income, and buy things equally.	Not respecting boundaries. I think a lot of young women (I know I was bad for this) will excuse behaviour that pushes their boundaries because they don't want to come across as being annoying or uptight or whatever. It's okay to stand up for yourself and ditch the guy who can't respect your boundaries!	0
Women of reddit, what are the best surprises a partner has done for you that also didn't cost a lot?	I’ll never forget the day my SO brought me home a mocha frappe with extra caramel drizzle. Except I don’t like mocha. I hate everything mocha/chocolate flavored and love the caramel frappe but he’d gotten confused and order the mocha by mistake and I let him have it but I was so touched by the sweet gesture. My love language is gifts and it’s centered around the thought of the gift so I’m equally stunned by someone bringing me a $1 candy and someone buying me a $700 piece of tech. I love when people stop and think I’d like this thing, so they bring it to me unprompted. It’s hands down the sweetest gesture in the world to me and the fact that I don’t drink mocha drinks just made the whole thing cute.	Coming home to a meal already cooked is always great. Doesn't even have to be a fancy meal, just whatever we were going to eat anyway.	0
What was the reason you walked out on a first date with someone?	She said “you know what, this date is over. I hope I never see you again.” So I told her “fine, then I’m leaving!” I don’t think she could hear me by that point, but whatever.	I went on a date with a guy once to a park. He ended up throwing a baby swing at me while i was on another swing. He did this because he wanted to get on and i wasn’t getting off fast enough. After i walked away and told him not to contact me, he thought that sending a dick pic would be a great way to say he wanted another date.	0
What are some problems that short girls face?	I used to have a huge problem with pants being too long, but then I started wearing more skinny type pants, any ones that i can just cuff instead of having to get them hemmed. Sometimes I can find pants with the perfect inseam, which is great	This is in combination with not wearing a ton of noticeable makeup, but people constantly assume I'm a teenager or worse. Last summer I went to check out of a hotel, and I was asked if I'm old enough to check out. The lady thought I was 12. Wtf?! I'm 25! Yes, I get that when I'm in my thirties and forties, it's going to be great to have my age underestimated, but I feel like I'm an easy target for being talked down to, mugged, and the like because everyone assumes I'm a little girl.	0
What is the most interesting wedding story you know?	It wasn’t technically at the wedding, but literally a week after we got married we found out I was pregnant. I took a test and woke up my new husband to show him the stick, which read “pregnant 5+ weeks”. He said “Oh shit” (in a happy/surprised way) then rolled over and went back to sleep.	My dad runs a food pantry/soup kitchen and he got ordained so that he could perform weddings for the chronically poor guests that usually couldn’t afford a typical wedding. One of these weddings took place in a 1950s themed hair salon where the bride worked. The bride wore her mother’s wedding dress and the groom wore blue jeans, a Guns N’ Roses tee and his finest leather vest. The guest list was small and most people sat in the salon chairs for the ceremony. After the newlyweds kissed we passed around a champagne toast to all of the guests and even the salon customers that attended because the salon was still open during the wedding. It was a very touching and truly bizarre experience.	0
What is your S/O like?	What, me chubster/grumpster/trumpster??? Seriously, he's a bit chubby, not really grumpy, but he farts a LOT, lol. He also is really intelligent (he's a software engineer and can do stuff I will never get my head round), funny as hell, a complete softie and willing to put up with me ;)	•He is equal parts hard working and playful. He divides our time together evenly between harassing and cuddling me. •He is excited about his interests and will make you excited about them, too. Just ask him one question about brewing beer, his 3-D printer or his laser engraver and prepare yourself to be interested in knowing more. •Kind I sometimes have a hard time keeping an open mind about unreasonable situations and people, but have learned so much from him. He gives people and situations room to unfold and move a bit. He isn’t interested in judgement or criticism. He has a “let’s see how this works out” approach to everyone and everything.	0
How soon did you move in with your S/O?	Just now and it's been good so far! We've been dating 8 years Granted, we met when we were 19 and 20, so we needed time to grow up a bit, and then time to get financially stable.	6 months in, and he proposed a week later. It’s only been a month and a half, but so far everything’s going great!	1
What examples of fragile masculinity have you encountered?	Something I've done which displays my male fragility is that I probably won't get a tattoo (that I really like) because I'm concerned people might find it too feminine.	I’m a waitress. The amount of dudes that will refuse/send drinks back because they come in a “girly” glass is unbelievable. The drinks usually consist of like 10 different kinds of fruit juices, liqueurs and schnapps but the hurricane glass and maraschino cherry is the line for them	0
Men on /r/askwomen, what have you learned while browsing this sub?	Father of an 11 year old girl checking in. Some time ago there was a thread about women and their relationships with their dads. "What do you wish he knew or did more" something along those lines. The takeaway I got from that was time spent together was the most important thing followed closely by just getting to know their daughters as people. The thread gave me a lot to think about.	That most of them don't want to talk to anyone in college as they paid to study and not socialize	1
What is something that is genuinely all right to hide from an SO?	How much of a slob you are when they're not around. They can assume... But they'll never know the true extent.	Masturbation For some reason people I date ask me if I masturbate I do, everyone does but I'm going to say no because it's one of their business	1
What’s the least cheating-like thing you consider cheating in a relationship?	Getting really drunk, or otherwise becoming intoxicated, without me there and without telling me first. It's not strictly cheating, but it makes me feel the same way that cheating would. It's partly a holdover from my extreme straightedge days, but also it just... I dunno. I don't like the idea of my partner becoming impaired if I'm not there to take care of them (and not finding out until afterwards). Also the idea of them having a bunch of fun without me adds to the jealousy factor.	Hanging out with or texting or talking to another woman and hiding it. Any of the above would be perfectly fine without the hiding it part. That really crosses a line with me.	0
What is the best lifestyle change you’ve made?	Going to the gym. I started about 8 months ago. I'm also really cheap so I feel like a gym membership is a waste of money... so what actually motivates me to go is that I am basically wasting my money if I don't go. I signed a 2 year membership. It does help me relieve stress, helps me separate from work (when I go after work), and gives me the alone time I crave.	Went vegan and started eating a high carb low fat diet. Life's just so great when I can eat my healthy ice cream for breakfast and eat as much as I want without worrying about calories. I'm honestly excited for every meal because food is just so delicious now. I also finally lost the stubborn 10 pounds I didn't think I could lose and most importantly knowing that I'm not supporting animal cruelty has brought alot of light into my life.	1
What is the absolute worst thing a therapist told their client?	Marriage counsellor. Told my wife her behaviours are fine and don’t need to change despite being the most critical and negative person I know. Counsellors are not supposed to give opinions just help you to talk. Thanks a bunch.	The practice I used to work at had a patient with severe PTSD from his time in combat. He overheard his therapist telling her office assistant that he was "crazy." It broke my heart.	0
Ladies, if your partner could comfortably (and willingly) support the both of you, would you still work?	Nope, but I'd be very productive. My entire reason for not wanting to work a conventional job is to have more time to work on things which I consider to be far more meaningful.	I would, because the idea of being "kept" makes me feel subhuman, like a pet or a toy or a servant. It makes my skin crawl. I'm pretty damn poor, though, so it's a sensitive subject for me. I'm also a huge hypocrite, because if I won the lottery or somehow ended up in a lucrative career I would be more than happy to support my family and partner, haha. But also, while I wouldn't "work" if I were wealthy, I would still be producing. Writing, gardening, making useful things, making art and theatre--all the hobbies I already do for a little compensation sometimes.	1
What simple comfort pleasures do you indulge in that may have deeper, darker memories attached to them?	I remember when I was a smoker I loved the smell. It reminded me of my father who had passed when I was young. I remember going to his family’s house and everyone would be sitting together in the living room enjoying a cigarette. It really comforts me whenever I smell cigarettes. Unfortunately it made it rather hard to kick the habit. But whenever I see a pack I always think of my dad and his family. It gives me a deep sense of nostalgia.	I'm obsessed with gilmore girls, I've watched too many times to count. I think I like it so much because I wanted my mom to show me she cared too.	1
Women that felt like a second best in a relationship, what is your story?	My estranged fiance moved back into his mom's basement because I grew tired of playing second fiddle - more like third - to his dogs. They always came first: their happiness, well-being, and everything else. They were always 'baby', 'love', 'sweetheart', etc. I just got tired of being ignored while he had to hug, kiss, and cuddle his dogs everyday. Our relationship was great until he got his first dog, then he got a second, kept a puppy from their first & only litter, and things really went downhill after that. I'm not sure if we'll get back together.	I was in a relationship for five years that, to be honest, I don't even think I ranked at 2nd. Wouldn't let me make a profile on his Xbox. Wouldn't go to the movies with me. Told me he couldn't be my best friend and boyfriend when I called him crying because my dog had been hit by a car. I'm honestly angry with myself for having low self esteem and dealing with it for 5 years.	0
What is the best example of irony that you’ve seen or experienced in real life?	My mother was a council member in my town growing up, and there was an insane (not pejorative; literal) couple who stalked her and acted like she was responsible for every evil in the world. One day, the town council voted on a sign ban. My mom voted against it. For weeks after that, the couple drove around with a huge sign on their car that said "[My mom] wants to pollute [the town] with signs."	Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.	1
Do you ever feel like your period invalidates your emotions? If so, how do you sort out the real emotions from the hormones?	They're all real emotions, and actually when I'm more hormonal and ornery, I'm less tolerant of stuff I really shouldn't tolerate anyway, so it works out to my benefit.	Only with my dog. He gets on my nerves so much when I'm PMSing but there's no reason for me to get annoyed by just normal doggin behavior. He doesn't annoy me otherwise, so I try to ignore my annoyance when it's that time of the month.	1
Dear Women, have you ever been in a happy relationship but just felt that longing to be single? How did it come about for you?	I really liked (like?) dating. I love the feeling of meeting someone new and thinking “wow, something might come of this!!” I like first kisses. I like going on dates. I like waiting for their text the next day. But I guess when it comes down to it, I like my boyfriend more. I have fond memories of dating, and it will just be that.	Every once in a while I think it would be nice to be single. Usually comes up if someone attractive is flirting with me.	1
Those who prefer pads to tampons - why?	I played volleyball so tampons were a must with spandex. Since I've only ever wore them - thats what I feel most comfortable wearing. If you don't like tampons where pads - it's not a big deal.	I hate the feeling of pushing a tampon in, and when my flow is light, the feeling of taking out a tampon that is still a bit dry.	0
What's your "controversial" film/television opinion?	The Last Jedi is garbage and nullified any renewed hope I had in a new trilogy that would help wipe the Prequels blemish from my mind. I'm really just an original trilogy fan.	Spoilers. Lily from 'How I Met Your Mother' is a terrible friend to Ted. I had to quit watching the show after it's revealed that she broke up his relationships because she couldn't picture them as elderly friends sipping iced tea together on a porch. (She did extremely underhanded things like leave jewelry out to make it look like Ted was cheating.) Ted, instead of being furious like any rational person, agrees that Lily's 'future vision' makes sense, and that she was right to break up his relationships! What the fuck guys?! Lily can't just, you know, talk to Ted? Ted still wants to be friends with someone so manipulative, especially when his goal in life is getting married? They don't even fight for a whole episode? Shoddy writing about a really shitty character.	0
If you could pick one question to be permanently banned to be asked on AskWomen - which one would it be and why?	Women who are 23 what advice do you have for women who are 22? Do these people actually think someone who is 1-5 years older than them has that much more knowledge than them? You’re in the same age group.	Probably the questions where a guy asks about approaching women. Not because the question is bad but because the replies are always filled with rants detailing how all women absolutely despise being approached in public and how no men should ever dare do it because you’ll ruin a woman’s entire day by saying hi.	1
Women in male-dominated, casual working environments, what are your summer work outfits?	I'm a programmer. We can't wear shorts at my job, so I usually wear pants inside(the A/C is intense so it is rather cold) but shorts when I leave. I also wear dresses. I am rather conservative so I wear girly things but you see no cleavage.	Stuff I wear to work: Button up shirts, you can find short sleeved or three quarter sleeved ones. Suit separate bottoms, including pants and knee length skirts Formal looking dresses at least knee length. If it’s sleeveless, I wear a cardigan. As for shoes, I stick to flats, oxfords, and occasionally strappy sandals if it goes with the outfit. Depending on your co workers, you might get a lot of attention on what you’re wearing. I’ve had male co workers complement me on my dress, and I’ve been reported to the manager for wearing a short sleeve t shirt to work (granted it was a back stabby office environment.) It isn’t fair and men don’t have to deal with this, but err on the side of formality and conservative when you dress.	1
What are things that if a person likes or dislikes them, you think it says a lot about their personality?	If they say they like Trump or any other member of the Republican Party, I will know right away that they are a person that doesn’t care about other human beings.	If a person likes to spends more time, energy and detail complaining about all the things they hate than talking about things they actually enjoy, they are usually draining to be around.	0
How have you grown as a person recently?	I'm getting better at letting things go until there's a better or more appropriate time to have a discussion. Basically tabling things instead of hastily rushing into things to soothe my anxiety.	My transition has taken huge steps and given me more motivation to treat myself better every day instead of being so down.	1
Lesbian women of Reddit who once thought you might be straight/bi: what did you feel toward men you THOUGHT you were attracted to? Straight/bi/pan women of Reddit: what do you feel toward men you ARE attracted to?	I'm pan and poly. My primary partner and one of my secondary partners are male, and I have a female secondary partner. Primary: He's funny, suave, sophisticated, incredibly intelligent, an amazing lover, and kind. I like his short dark hair and beard the most, aesthetically. I love him. Want to bang him all the time. Male identifying Secondary: He's funny, goofy, nerdy, gamer. He's kind, understanding, sweet. I like his long hair and his eyes the most, aesthetically. I like him a lot. Definitely want to bang him a lot. Female identifying Secondary: She's shy, sweet, and beautiful. I don't know her too well yet but I definitely want to bang her.	I’m gay but tried to convince myself I could be bi when I was younger, like middle school aged. The only boy I’ve ever had a crush on was a friend of mine in 7th grade. I thought he was cute and wanted to hang out with him. My crush ended when my friends told me they wanted to hold hands and kiss their crushes and I realized I had no interest in that, turns out I just really wanted to be friends with this dude	0
What will you not pay more than $20 for? And what can you not imagine paying less than $20 for?	Won’t spend any more than 20$ on clothing. Why the fuck does it have to be so expensive! I can’t imagine paying less than 20$ for a computer.	Respectively: a trip to the cinema, and shoes for work. I work at a nightclub, and am thus constantly on my feet. The floors are very wet and sticky too. I need boots that can withstand that.	0
Women who married other women, how did you decide what your surname(s) would be?	We hyphenated. We decided whose name went first by which sounded better. One way rolled off the tongue much easier so that's what we stuck with. We toyed with doing some unique combination for our names but one combination sounded like a Dr. Seuss creature and the other most obvious combination was Cunter. "Hi, we're your new lesbian neighbors, the Cunter's." Yeah... not gonna happen.	My wife really wants to change to my name but that isnt legal to do where we live Because they wanted to protect women from being "forced to change their names for marriage" and now just completely removed choice. That's freedom for ya...	1
What's your favorite lady-to-lady term of endearment?	Sis is up there at number 1. However I try to be careful with gendered terms because I don’t want to potentially hurt anymore!	A homeless man recently called me "sis" and I loved it. I aspire to call other women that. I use "lady" and sometimes "mama" or "girl". "Chica" and "babe" feel dated to me. I worked as a bartender in college and "Hon" is my least favorite ToE.	0
How much does your current SO know about your past love life?	He knows as much as he wants to know. I'm always open for questions about my past and he's open to answering any questions I might have, which have been very few. Honestly, his past is his past and helped shape him into the wonderful husband and man I call my best friend. Same for my past. The events in it were important in creating who we are today but that's about it. The past stays in the past as we walk forward into our future together.	I always let them know I’ve taken massive dongs in the past so I always have that over them, that look in their eyes when they know you’ve already been conquered by a bigger beast 👀	1
What was your "take this job and shove it" moment?	My manager expected me to go in to work the day after my nana died. When I said I wasn't going in, she said ''it wasn't your mum, you need to be here.'' I quit on the spot.	First job. Wendy's. 7am. Cutting up onions for prep. Mascara all over my face. Told my boss I was taking a break and just got in my car and left. No regrets.	1
Women who have PCOS, what are some struggles you have that other women may not know about?	The hair growth. The crippling pain. Not just oh my uterus is aching. The pain sometimes can drop you to your knees. The fast weight gain as a teen. The depression from all of the above. The medication that makes you feel worse than ever.	The fear of not being able to have kids. We don't use any contraception and we've never had a pregnancy scare in 5yrs of being together	1
What are some examples of healthy boundaries in a relationship?	Have your own things that you do without your SO, like your own hobbies. Have your own group of friends that you hang out with, without each other. Don’t become one entity and do everything together. Be able to spend time apart without getting restless about it. Basically, have some semblance of your lives separate from each other. Oh and also, no shaving pubes in front of each other or peeing/pooping whilst your SO is in the bathroom with you. I’ve heard of some couples who do both those things and it’s weird af...	Having a life outside of your relationship. Like not spending all your free time with your SO and neglecting your friends & family. Not having them read your texts from your family & friends. Not get offended when they do the same.	0
What popular movie conveys a terrible message?	The Breakfast Club. The jerk who sexually harasses you and verbally abuses you is not dating material just because he’s being abused at home. He needs to show that he’s capable of long term change before you even begin to consider it. To show an example of the opposite: the original Beauty and the Beast. Belle initially resents the hell out of the Beast. It’s not until he shows kindness, restraint, a willingness to learn, and mercy that she falls for him.	Juno. It's ok for teenage girls to get pregnant because rich couples will want to adopt the child right away. And of course the baby daddy is deeply in love and wants to be with her....that's how it always works /s	1
What’s the saddest story your parents ever told you about their lives?	My parents immigrated to Canada from south east Asia with three young kids and about $100 in their pocket having lost everything they had due to war. With a language barrier and no marketable skills, they took low paying jobs just to get by. My dad had found a job working in the kitchen of donut shop. He was promised something like $4 per hour but when his first paycheck came, he found out they had cheated him so he quit on the spot. He spend the next days going around the city looking for another job. One day, my mother was on her way home from her seamstress job and bumped into him on the city bus. He was crying because he couldn’t find a job. Thinking of my strong, stoic dad publicly crying out of desperation will always get me.	Not my parents, but my mom's mother. My grandma (we call her Bachan as a reference to the Japanese word for grandmother) experienced two miscarriages before she had my uncle, and then eventually my mom.	1
What is the worst Tinder date/ experience you’ve ever had?	went back to her place for sex, 2 and a bit years later and i'm in the most loving relationship of my life- worst hook up app ever!	Went back to his place, presumably for sex, and the pillowcases were stained with blood. Place was filled with empty beer cans. Four, I kid you not, four rusty, hair-filled razors in the shower (all were his - he lived alone.) The sink was coated in hair and toothpaste. I was so disturbed. Then he told me he had a suspended license and a kid he never met, and I high-tailed it home.	0
In what non-abusive ways did your parents cause long term damage?	My dad cheated on my mom.. but instead of trying to work on the marriage and moving forward since he did stay for the family.. my mom beat it in to me to this day all men cheat all men are bad.. .i found out later she never had sex with my dad .. ever! No wonder he cheated... and stayed for 36 years! Now I trust knowone.. and can not get truly close to anyone.	They didn't say "I love you" much to me or my older sister, or even between themselves. A few years ago they made an effort to say it more and the first time it happened I sincerely thought one of them was deathly ill since it was so unusual. They also weren't big on physical affection or praise in general. It can be very hard for me to acknowledge when others do positive things, but I can focus with laser precision on negative things. They aren't great at standing up for me or my sister either. One side of our family is just a bunch of old fashioned, spoiled assholes and it was always "you should be the bigger person" even when I was a literal child. Edit: I'm so bummed that so many people relate to this. Group hug, y'all 🤗	0
Ladies, have you ever quit your job on the spot?	My last workplace was a bit of a nightmare at times. It was a casual and low key environment but the owner could be intense and the clients were stressful. Combine that with low pay and you have a revolving door of employees. There were so many times I wanted to leave, but I was worried about finding another job quickly. I decided to stick it out until I could secure a new job. It took me about 6-7 months to find a new workplace and it was well worth the wait. My current job pays me twice as much and provides some of the best benefits in the country. Meanwhile, I had a coworker that decided to quit on the spot. It’s probably been a little over two years since then and she still hasn’t found something stable. She’s pretty much been interviewing ever since.	I quit my part-time serving job a few hours before my shift. I absolutely could not stand to work another day there. I live in PA, USA and my company has an "At-Will" clause and I can quit any time for any reason. I felt *so relieved*. I hated working there. The shift was going to be a long, grueling seven hours of nonsense, making shit for money. Every day since, I look back and am SO happy I did it. I deserved it. I hated that job and it makes terrible money working long hours doing too much side work for $2.83/hour. I have a great employment record so this "incident" is insignificant to me. I also check on their Google reviews every now and then and am secretly pleased to see their star rating go down. (At a 3.9 out of 5 right now)	1
Women who were in toxic relationships where they loved the other person, how did you finally leave?	Abuse doesn't have to be physical to justify leaving. Emotional and verbal abuse is terrible too. If some one fucks with your self esteem, belittles or disrespects you, gtfo asap. They need individual therapy. Some people will never change though. Think "Would I let a stranger insult me? No. Then why am I letting someone who supposedly loves me do this?" Love doesn't make you walk on eggshells or cause anxiety/stress. Please confide in a friend or family member and get out safely.	I was finally more afraid of being with him than being without him. When you're afraid of being alone, the other person has a gun to your head.	0
Women with body dysmorphia, what are your coping strategies?	I try to look at my body as a whole. Sure, my thighs might be big, but with the rest of my body they look quite decent. Other people don’t see all the details like we do. They don’t just see “fat thighs” or “soft stomach”, they see a whole living, capable body Another thing that has helped me has been what my body can do - I can work for whole days at the shelter now, which is amazing! At one point i could hardly go for a walk without needing to sit down, now I’m on my feet for 9 damn hours and it feels GOOD. And those thighs make that possible, damnit. So i gotta accept them and care for them, cuz they make living life a possibility	I don’t own a scale any more. It lies anyway. I used to have all these strategies for scales, like peeing before getting on and weighing myself first thing in the morning before I ate anything. Honestly, I am pretty sure I weight upwards of 20 pounds more than high school but I still fit in my prom dress, so intellectually I know weight means nothing. I like high waisted jeans for holding in the belly, and I just don’t have full length mirrors any longer either.	1
What is something in life that never lived up to the hype for you as much as it seems to for everyone else?	Any kind of interpersonal relationships. Sex was the worst thing ever, kissing was horrible, even just casually spending time with other people is solidly meh. Like, people enjoy others? And don't feel like that's a burden? Sounds fake.	High school. I heard a lot that it's supposed to be some great, responsibility-free fun time in your life with parties and friends for life and fun. I was glad to get out of there.	0
What's the most patronising thing that someone has ever said to you? And how did you respond to it?	Open discussion in my sociology class. When I was saying that, as a woman, I'm not oppressed, the guy I was talking to told me I was too oppressed to know better. One of the few examples of "mansplaining" I've ever experienced, ironically.	I have a friggin' PhD in engineering, and this male coworker, who does not, offered to "help me with the math" in an article he suggested I read. I told him about my degree until he scooted backward uncomfortably out of my office. I'm still steamed though.	0
Women who use tampons, do you ever accidentally “push” out your tampon while trying to poop?	Not hard enough to completely come out but I have had problems where it will slip down to an uncomfortable position. So I usually just remove it before I poop.	If that happens, the tampon is probably not inserted deep enough. It usually doesn't come out only from pushing, that's why there's a string attached.	1
What does your SO say to you that has you melting?	usually a few "youre dying a slow death, i poison your lunch and dinner every day" "you annoy me" and lastly "you are it, and that's it" edit - realize this is ask women and im a man, but im leaving my.answers	He really likes alone time and I come from a big family and never need time alone. He’s really good at telling me if he wants to play video games or something and we work well together. But I recently went on vacation and we both figured he would enjoy a full week of playing video games and watching tv he wanted to watch and me not monopolizing his time (#bachelorlife). First day I get a text that says “It’s pretty lonely without you here”.	0
What are your favorite or most creative date night ideas?	THIS IS WHAT YOU DO: PUT A PLASTIC GARBAGE BAG IN A LARGE CARDBOARD BOX AND FILL THAT WITH WATER. PUT IT IN THE FREEZER TURN IT INTO A HUGE SOLID ICE BLOCK THEN USE THAT TO SIT ON AS A SLIDE DOWN A HILL AND GET PLASTERED BEFOREHAND.	There is a 90s/early 2000s cover band that frequents my area. I love to take people to go see them. Everyone always starts out 'ugh, pop music is soooo cheesy!' But then I catch them humming 'I Want It That Way' and we work our way up to belting out Britney Spears at the top of our lungs.	0
[Controversal] Women who get offended by other women breastfeeding (pictures, public, etc), why??	So, I have no problem if they’re breastfeeding under a blanket or in the nursing mothers section of wherever, but I’ve seen way too many moms with 2-4 year olds just hanging on the breast. And these kids like, stop nursing for a few seconds and you see full nipple. I draw the line there. That’s just not something I woke up this morning hoping to see.	I feel very awkward about it but I recognise that as a problem with *me* and how I’ve been socialised to hypersexialise the manner in which I myself ate as a child.	0
What's the most insidious way someone made your special thing all about them?	I'll offer up a light one: My partner and I went pretty non\-traditional with our wedding plans: low cost, informal ceremony, two parties a month apart, one on each coast. I made my dress, but splurged on a super cute pair of shoes I had been stalking for a year. ADORABLE Fluevog mary janes in my perfect color and style, and went so well with my dress you'd think I'd been orchestrating this for a decade. At our second party a friend of my mom's/mine sees my shoes and goes gaga over them and says "OMG I love those shoes, they would look so good on me. They are so ME!" B\*tch, you wish; you can tell me how much you envy and appreciate my style now though, thx.	I was sexually abused and scared to share it with anyone but police. I specifically told my mom not to share it because I was scared. My mother proceeded to call everyone she knew, even past neighbors we had, tell them all about it, and then talk about how hard and crippling it was *for her*.	0
Women of Reddit who waited until marriage to have sex.... how do you feel about your decision looking back on it?	Perception is reality.. if you think you have a satisfying sex life, then you do. But respectfully speaking, without experiencing sex with more than one partner you really have no concept that sex with different people can be entirely different! It’s not the difference between say.. New York style pizza vs Chicago style pizza it’s more like the difference between sitting on a luxurious beach enjoying the ocean vs getting a root canal.	I don't regret waiting because I'm a bit on the asexual side and it didn't feel like a sacrifice, but I do regret the relationship.	0
what is the last book you have read and how much did you like it ?	The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver, I give it a 10/10. It had adventure, heart, and people proving their mettle. Strong women!	The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. I already knew the story after watching the movie starring Leonardo di Caprio, but I found the book to be underwhelming. Fitzgerald loves to throw together words that make no sense together. It’s like he tried to force a metaphor into every sentence. It’s amusing to read at times but kind of tiring to try to figure out what the heck he means. I enjoyed reading the book but I don’t understand why it’s so popular.	1
What are the details of couples that you know that show perfect lives on social media, but in their private lives it is a different story?	Couple 1: Lots of couple trips, dinners, fancy drinks, couple selfies. He doesn't go down on her. Couple 2: Trips, dinners, couple selfies, cute posts about eachother. He has ED and last year they didn't have sex at all.	My older sister has this perfect little Facebook Family, but she is the most financially irresponsible human being I have ever met in my life. She'll throw a massive birthday party for her two-year-old that she spent literally thousands of dollars on and hire a professional photographer to document the whole thing and post it all over Facebook to show the world she's the perfect mom, all while she's maxing out her credit cards and overdrafting her bank account every other week.	0
Any other women with no female friends...how are you doing?	I am not good friends with anyone. Unless you count relatives and my SO. I prefer not having friends these days. My attempts at making friends end up them being flaky or using me. Doesn't bother me though. I love my alone time and spending time with my family.	Fine. I've never had a female friend. I always get downvoted when I say that, but it's true. No girl or woman has ever tried to befriend me, but to be fair, it's not like I've attempted to befriend them either. I don't know what having a female friendship would even look like. I just picture a lot of extreme awkwardness and anxiety. I don't know how to relax around or relate to other women my age.	1
What’s a one thing that makes you think “I might be a super shitty girlfriend”?	I’m not the girlfriend anymore, but after my ex and I broke up, I started to really realize how bad some of my behaviors and habits were and it positively mortifies me. I was very clingy and not understanding enough, and I let my depression and anxiety take me over and ruin our relationship. It makes me extremely embarrassed to think about the things I did.	He'll give me the world if I asked him to. He's paid to fix my car, treated me to an awesome birthday, washed and put away MY clothes while I was at work, and so much more. However, sometimes I groan if he asks me to do something for him, like wash his back or to order something online for him. I wish I wasn't so selfish. He really is the bomb. :(	1
Ladies that live/lived with a man who didn't do any housework, how do/did you cope?	I make him earn all the money, while I stay home and run the household? It's called traditional division of labor, it's not new or weird.	Lived with 3 guys in college. All expected me to pick up after them and refused to help. One day, I called a house meeting. I told them it was unfair and I wasn’t their mother. Then I gave them each an itemized bill for my cleaning service. I said I’d be glad to clean provided they pay the weekly charge. They started pulling their weight after that.	0
What was a dealbreaker for you - either romantic or platonic - that you didn’t realize was a dealbreaker until you were faced with it?	Someone who openly doesn’t like their family. Who doesn’t want to be involved with their family for no apparent reason (there was no abuse or issues within the family) and avoid them or put them down. The person won’t go for Christmas dinner because “they are just blood related and I just happened to be born by them so why I should I try?” attitude. It really shows a lot about character.	A lack of consideration or tact. People who lack empathy, respect, humor, or depth are hard for me to click with. I need people who have similar values or morals.	0
Single women over 30, does dating get harder?	From my own dating and the experience of friends, I'd say it's having children that ups the difficulty, not ageing. I'm in my 30s and c.f. and haven't really noticed any difference at all, but my friends who are single mums (even if they haven't got to 30 yet) have a waaay harder time of it. Just the logistics alone of dating when you're a single parent can be a nightmare, let alone finding any decent dates.	Does this person who told you this info have kids? Been divorced? Have a shitty personality? Is she ugly? Im 43 its not any different then when i was under 30. Might be because i have zero kids and dont want them and do not care if i get married. Im not horribly ugly and dont look 43. Men havent changed. They are still horn dogs who want and need a woman. They just dont try as hard at my age anymore cuz theres always masturbation or a desperate chic.	1
How did your vagina change after birth?	My actual vagina? I don’t think it has. My vulva and genital area? I notice my perineum hurts a bit during early penetration, I imagine that’s because I had stitches. Nothing else seems different and my partner confirmed when I asked. I’m just over 3 months postpartum.	I'm definitely somewhat looser, but it was verging on too tight before my first delivery. What I've seen from most medical sources is that some difference is normal and common (though not universal), but it isn't typically enough to cause serious problems, outside of greater than usual trauma.	1
What is the most sheltered thing you heard from someone?	I gave a friend a ride to this local shopping centre and she asked if she could leave her bag in my car. I said sure put it in the back. She asked why she couldn't just leave it on the passenger seat. I was confused but explained it might make the car a target for theft and she was like, "but... How can someone get into a locked car?" Like she seriously had no idea that breaking into a car was a thing or that people might steal things out of cars.	This woman was telling me about how she had to pay a huge amount of cash for her Brother's wedding and that she doesn't even like his wife. I said "its like life just likes to turn you over and fuck you in the ass." She said she doesn't even like to get fucked in the ass.	1
Women who have gained or lost a lot of weight, how differently did family/friends/strangers treat you?	As I have aged and naturally gained weight into my adult body/set point, the difference is striking. Before, I was what I like to call "meta hot" - not actually that attractive, just thinwhiteblondetits etc. People paid attention to me, but superficially, to gain something, even subconsciously. I was seen as simultaneously more interesting and less intelligent. Strangers smiled more.	I've lost about 30 pounds \(only 24 more to go!\), and people feel the need to comment on just about everything I eat. If I get a salad, I get, "How can you eat that rabbit food?" Well, because this Asian chicken salad is fucking delicious! If I splurge and eat a burger, I get, "Aren't you on a diet?" Yes, and I've planned for this meal. One person in my life is really obnoxious about it. I follow Weight Watchers and any time I eat a small piece of candy or something, she'll say, "That's \[x\] points!" Yes, I fucking know. I literally just tracked it. Just let me eat a damn meal in peace!	0
Ladies who look healthy but are dealing with an “invisible illness” (mental or physical), what is your story?	I have multiple mental illnesses, insulin resistance, possible endometriosis, and a serious thyroid issue. I’ve struggled for years trying to figure out what was wrong and how to fix it to have the best life I could. I’ll always need to be on medication. And I’ll most likely always be effected by ptsd and anxiety/bipolar disorder. But my meds and therapy have helped dramatically.	Chronic fatigue, chronic gastritis, chronic nausea, chronic vomiting, chronic pain, chronic insomnia, chronic depression. I'm in the food service industry, probably twice as old as most of my co-workers, and I still show up to every shift with a grit-my-teeth determination to not let my problems show, and I run circles around some of them. Guess I'm kind of a master at hiding shit. For sure though, I'm very tired of always trying to appear strong, healthy and happy	0
What are less obvious signs that you should end your relationship?	If you're not a person of habits, like you don't find it difficult to change things for the better and not like you get use to something too much even a change for the better feels uncomfortable, imagine what you would do if you met someone who truly seems better than your SO and you knew your SO wouldn't be upset at all to break up. That might help to figure out if you have strong feelings for your SO, you're happy with him and that's why you're with him or you're with him because you don't want to be single/you don't think you might meet someone better/you're afraid of hurting him by leaving.	When I started censoring my thoughts and opinions around him instead of excitedly sharing them, and resented his input instead of seeking it.	0
What was the worst bachelorette party you've ever been to and why?	I've only been to one, and I found it IMMENSELY frustrating that the maid of honour thought that a group of 9 could walk into a Mexican restaurant, on Cinco de Mayo, on a Saturday, in a city with a population of 6 million, and not need a fucking reservation.	I didn't know where we were going.. I was 17 at the time.. turns out.. They took me to a male strip club. The chicks all screamed and tried to get the men over to rub on them. Damn. No self respect. If you were decent looking you wouldn't have to pay men to pay attention to you. I cringed the whole time and beat a fast retreat. Wtf. Friggin grannies begging for nuts in their face. Sad as fuck.	1
People who were in a long term relationship and got dumped, how do you feel now?	3 year isn't long. You're young, you've changed and grown up, and I'd guess grown a lot. Better to break up now that in 5 years from now when you have a kid, and a house etc etc etc. Broke up with my long-term university BF (he was terrible) met my now husband almost 7 years ago, the best thing that had ever happened to me. If I had stayed with my Ex I'd be miserable.	First, I was pissed. Then, I was sad. Then, I pretended like i wasnt sad. Then, I was a combination of even more sad and pissed and motivated. Then i was less pissed, less sad, and more motivated. Then it was just motivated. Then i stopped caring. All of that was about two years	0
What is something about your period that isn't as common as you thought?	Attempting suicide shortly before every period is not a common occurrence. It's also not common for your period to just disappear for months at a time	I thought bleeding through a super tampon in less than two hours for two days of my period was normal was normal. I also thought that having period cramps so bad that I would be curled up and crying in the fetal position was normal. Turns out it’s not.	0
How did you prepare for marriage?	Gonna go a different way, and say: by not cohabitating without commitment. Marriage, to me, is a different pair\-bond than dating/ living together, and I wanted to differentiate marriage from dating, publicly and emotionally. I don't buy the idea that you need to live with someone to know them, so when I met my now\-husband and realized we are compatible as roommates, financial partners, friends, romantically, we just talked about our expectations regarding everything, ESPECIALLY money and roommate stuff	I think the most helpful thing was discussing our values behind the recommended premarital topics - money, kids, household duties, etc. For example, my husband values spending money on hobbies much more than I do. Understanding his value for this, rather than just the budget, has been very helpful in marriage. Budgets and expectations can change, but learning how to articulate value is so important. Like some posters, we didn't live together before marriage. I understand why some people want to do this! However, I think it helped my husband and I separate the difference between dating and marriage and intentionally restructure our lives once we made the marriage commitment.	0
What should you absolutely ask for on your wedding registry?	Money. Edit: apparently this is unpopular, but that's normal where I'm from and the only useful wedding gift I received.	One of the best presents we got was a garbage can for the kitchen. Not just any garbage can it was this nice steel and black looking one that you don’t touch w your hands. You just tap it w your feet and it opens up. I’ve been married 9 years and it still works. It’s one of those things you don’t think to buy but when it lasts you quite a bit you realize that it’s a damn good present lol	0
If someone you liked rejected you, how would you feel about being told the reason (in an honest and respectful manner)?	Absolutely. It fustrates me that i never know what it is. I have a type, and that type has things they like. Trying to change yourself for a certain person is foolish, but I want to change myself to meet what my dating type, in general, likes.	Honestly I think I would appreciate it. Sure, it would hurt but it would prevent me from internalizing and overthinking the rejection. It would also let me understand their perspective and hopefully make the rejection easier to deal with knowing how they feel about me. It also takes a lot for someone to be honest and respectful when rejecting someone, and I find that to be meaningful.	0
What’s the dumbest mistake you made while playing Pokémon?	When I was playing Red for the first time (I was about 7), I learned the hard way that if you release a Pokémon, it is gone forever. Eezword J the Drowzee... Gone but never forgotten.... 😢	Accidentally dropped my gameboy causing the game to reset back to new. I had a mew on my old save. No way of getting that back.	1
Women of reddit at what point did you decide that your mental health required professional involvement?	When everything lost color and it all just seemed like a cold grey winter day, even on the sunniest day in the summer. All I wanted to do was lay in my bed. I functioned, barely, but as soon as I could it was back to bed.	When things I used to like doing start feeling like chores (still a giant red flag for me). So when I'd meet up with a friend I would no longer think 'yay friend' but 'Ok I'm meeting someone, should make sure I do my laundry, shit need to be at the bus at 19.00, I hope I can get home early, do I have anything to talk about?'. Also just in general not getting joy out of fun things, not being in the mood to watch a movie, read, write, because those things no longer felt rewarding but 'meh, this is ok-ish' at most.	0
Black ladies, how do you find men who are interested in serious relationships/marriage?	I met my fiance online. He is an South Asian man, so I was very surprised that he was still interested in me. He told me that he found black women very attractive as well as others. I was so surprised because every man before him made it clear they weren't attracted to black women or they didn't want anything serious with me. It was disheartening because I truely believed that I was ugly because of my race when I was younger. I'm lucky I found someone who appreciates me for me, but to answer your question...it's just hard out there.	I go for the low hanging fruit. The men I go for are lonely, depressed, and just want to be loved. Also I only go for white guys. Also, I'm sorry, but the statistics aren't pretty, I'm going to have much better luck at life with a white guy than a black guy.	1
What annoys you the most in literotica?	21(M) here that loves literotica as it makes a nice change from porn. The stuff that I like to read isn’t necessarily like 50 shades of grey... its more like stuff you find on xnxx stories. I’m curious as to what women like to read and any recommendations to all time favourites?	Most of the male characters have the “most beautiful green eyes” and the women have “the deepest crystal blue eyes”. Every sexy dude on the planet can’t have green eyes!	0
How would 13-year-old you feel about your current SO?	I think 13 year old me would be completely smitten over my boyfriend. I’m pretty sure as far as looks go my taste has always been the same, looking back at kids I had crushes on when I was in school they all look the same: dark hair, dark eyes and tanned skin. However 13 year old me would’ve wanted to be married with kids by now (I’m 24) but I don’t want marriage or kids now.	13yo me would be jealous of current me. Hes everything 13yo me would have wanted. Cute, into emo music (even though we are both past dressing that way haha) into computers, caring, tall. If i told past me, either past me would be jealous or wonder how i tricked him hahah	1
Did you end up in a totally different career to what you studied for? And how?	oh 100&#37; Studied Psychology in University and now I work as a Business Analyst in Oil & Gas. I would've loved to follow a career in psych, but I couldn't get accepted into Grad Schools. :\( I enjoy working in Oil & Gas mainly because I make good money and it's a flexible company that treats their employees well.	Yup, I went to school for early childhood education and English, with the idea that I would be a kindergarten teacher and write. I hated student-teaching, but thought it would get better. A month in, and I was completely miserable, and was talking to my parents about it. I offhand said that I should have been a lawyer instead. My mom told me "women lawyers are bitches". So I registered for the LSAT that night, did well, got accepted to a good school moved across country and now I'm a practicing attorney. So I did a career change out of spite. And I'm so much happier.	0
What's it like having a healthy relationship with food?	I don't know that that is healthier than... I honestly don't know what the flipside of this would be, without falling into fatphobic rhetoric. Calories comprise one of the literal things we need to live. We are an intensely social species. Ergo, food is more than energy, although that is important too. It's community and art and all things that contribute to our health that aren't about an arbitrary beauty standard and/or trend.	Growing up in PA and then living in LA for a long time, I was introduced to this foreign concept that eating healthy means you *feel* better. I had always been around this narrative that it’s all about how you look, and not necessarily a tool for well-being and mental health. That changed everything for me. Edit: LA= Los Angeles	0
Inspired by the “swipe left” AskMen post - Why are women more accepting of overweight men than the reverse?	Popular media plays a role (as others have mentioned). Just think about all the tv shows where there's a heavier set hubby with an amazingly attractive and/or fit/slim woman. Family Guy, The Simpsons, The Sopranos, Fresh Prince, King of Queens, etc. Even Cersei Lannister and Robert Baratheon for crying out loud. Edit to add: how much you want to bet most of the dudes who said "fat" was a dealbreaker are, indeed, fat themselves?	Because women aren’t as fickle as some men can be. Yeh looks are important, but honestly personality is more important to me. I’ve dated some average and even below average dudes based on what seemed like a good personality.	1
What's the biggest Tinder "red flag" you've encountered?	Theres a really cute guy who appears as a match on OKC but his profile has "feminist as long as you understand it means equality for all" and it makes me angry.	I’m no longer on dating sites because I’ve met someone, but I was always creeped out by the dudes who insisted on meeting right away/that same night or meeting at their house. No thanks.	0
Why do people sometimes think that fashion-obsessed women are unintelligent?	Because the same part of the brain that used for processing intellectual activities is required for fashion sense and the need to look "good". Am glad you used the word obsessed. same part the brain gets preoccupied when we need to carry out complex task. People expecially ladies who want look good so bad are usually mentally lazy. If you have ever wondered why many proffessors care a little less how they look, there you have your answer. When the brain is in a flow state, we tend to zone out of the externals and focus on inner layers of the mind. That is not the case with fashion obsessed women.	Our culture has a stereotype of nerdy intelligent people being poorly dressed and awkward. A lot of media focusing on fashion goes hand in hand with more shallow media (e.g. the fashion spreads and who wore it best type articles in People Magazine or Cosmo). Also, people might assume if you are devoting a lot of time to intellectual pursuits, you won’t have time for “frivolous” things like fashion. A lot of people are calling out sexism, which I don’t disagree with, but I think there is more to it.	0
What life changing cosmetic products are you glad you tried?	I hate to admit it (because they're soooooo overpriced and also a stupid MLM!) but my S.I.L. sells Rodan+Fields skin products. She gave me a tube of their lash serum for Christmas and... IT WORKS. I've always had stubby, thin eyelashes. They're not loads thicker, but they're a LOT longer! I've used my tube sporadically since early January (avg. 3x week). And it's still got serum in it. So it lasts a good long while, esp. if you use it every other day. They'll tell you to *USE IT EVERY DAAAAAY YOU HAVE TO!* but it still works if you don't. ...I might have to buy more when this tube's out, despite my better judgment. Edit: typo	Urban decay eyeshadow primer.. I have oily, semi hooded lids and before I used it my eyeshadow would look terrible within an hour.. over the years I’ve gone through several tubes and will continue to repurchase Face moisturizer.. I wasn’t doing it before on a consistent basis before 25 but now I use it everyday and I saw improvement within 2 weeks of daily use. Now it’s been about 3 month and my skin looks so much more beautiful. If you do a little research on your skin type and issues you can find a moisturizer to help your skin improve. Batiste dry shampoo... I have long, straight hair so I get oily pretty quickly but I also hate washing it and bc of its length the drying process can take forever. On day three I can use it and still look good enough to have my hair down.	0
What 5 food things bring you the most joy?	1. There way a pizza crust is charred when it was cooked in a wood fired oven 2. The gooey center of a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven 3. Fresh, in-season peaches 4. How satisfying it is to chop up a bar of semisweet chocolate with a chefs knife 5. Eating something you spent the whole day making from scratch.	1. A fresh triple steakburger with cheese, ketchup, and mayo from Steak and Shake. 2. Homemade fries. 3. Mashed potatoes with garlic. 4. Orange soda floats. 5. Pepperoni and grilled chicken pizza from Pizza Hut.	1
Have you ever had a good intuition or gut feeling that ended up coming true?	I have a happy one! I was 20, in college, and had just started dating a new guy after getting out of a long-term, not very healthy relationship. I was really only looking for a fling, but for some reason I could clearly visualize raising children with this guy. Since marriage and kids were not even on my radar at this point, my response to this was pretty much “what the hell, brain?” Fifteen years later, I’m married to him and we’re raising two kids together. Apparently my brain knew what the hell it was talking about.	I had a feeling something was wrong in my relationship. Been together for a really long time. Intimacy was lacking, making love had become routine, was sporadic...if at all. Compliments and little gestures of affection had dissapeared. He was protective of his phone...spending more time in the office "working" . I decided to snoop. The password on his computer was changed. WTF? I tried his work laptop, same thing. I tried his phone, same thing. All my bells were going off. I had a computer expert come in and forensically search the computer, it didn't him long to crack the password. I discovered porn, terabytes of it. He was spending up to 9 hours a day surfing the shit. No wonder he kept hand cream on his desk. And the fucking tissues...said his allergies were always bothering him. I learned about porn addiction fast. Thank\-god I listened to my intuition.	1
How do you feel about your worst heartbreak now?	It still hurts once in a while. My ex-husband ended up marrying one of my best friends. They were together while we were married. I actually had a tougher time losing her than I did losing him. All those times I wanted to call her or text her to tell her something funny, I couldn't. When I started dating again, she was the first person that I wanted to tell. When I had a good date or a horrible date, I wanted to tell her. It was a rough for a while. I guess the only good thing that came of it is that she is now my kids stepmom, and I know she loves those kids like they are her own. The bad part about her being their stepmom is that there is a lack of boundaries. She oversteps a lot, and its frustrating.	I just wonder once and a while if his wife knows what I do... Like, in hindsight years later, I'd really want to know what I know about him. But, I don't know her and no good would come of trying to get involved. It's been so long, I don't feel much of anything. It really feels like when I look back, it's like it was another lifetime altogether.	1
What is a subculture you identify with that most people either don't know about, or severly misunderstand?	I'm a CouchSurfer. Thanks to a bunch of thirsty guys writing aspirational articles full of what they hoped would be the truth and those articles being shared for shock value, people think that CouchSurfing (or any hospitality exchange) is some sort of sexual thing. It couldn't be further from the truth.	I’m a 22 year old Hispanic woman who is a classic liberal, I enjoy Ben Shapiro’s content, Jordan B Peterson and Dave Rubin, also I love shoe0nhead. I don’t know if it’s a culture, but I know I’m not that common in these circles.	1
Your pet has a business trip over the weekend. What human care instructions do they leave for you?	Morning alarm at 3- by crashing against the bedroom door and playing nascar. Then you must sit on her chest and stare lovingly at her until she gets up to feed me.	You must sleep across her neck like a cat scarf. Even though it is summer. She will try to tell you she doesn’t like it, but that’s a lie.	0
What online service is worth the monthly fee and why?	Netflix and Spotify. I listen to A LOT of music so definitely worth it for me and Netflix is just awesome.	Do yourself a favor and pay for an anti-virus for your devices, including PCs, tablets, and smartphones. It's usually a yearly subscription. Just Google "best anti-virus of [insert year]" and pick one from one of the articles. You can go with free, but you get what you pay for. I find many free ones to have annoying "features."	1
Just out of curiosity, what are jobs that a man/woman could have that are dealbreakers for you?	Personally: politician, political staff, military, law enforcement, and probably a lawyer or a surgeon. There are definitely a few others but those are the first that come to mind.	Any job that involved being away for long periods. Like long haul airline pilots or submariners or any business that involves extensive traveling.	0
What gender stereotypes do you see in books, games, tv and movies that you have never witnessed in real life?	How come vagina owners in TV shows never get their periods? Or deal with fluctuating hormones? Or taking hormone replacement medication? It's as if all that operates in a magical peaceful vaccum when realistically it likes to get into raging dumpster fire mode quite often.	It’s either all girly-girl or all tomboy for female characters and there is no in between. It’s two dimensional and boring.	0
Women who are ambivalent about having children, what is the biggest reason why you wouldn't want them?	As a mom of two: If you’re not willing to “life” for and with another individual 24/7, don’t have kids. 🗣💋🦄🖤🤷🏻‍♀️ EDIT: “I don’t want them. I don’t have a reason.” Is 100% a perfectly good reason. Dont let ANYONE convince you into kids- you convince you.	The potential to wreck my body/health, having to put the child first over everything else and the lifestyle change. Comes across as selfish and probably is a little but it’s a huge responsibility that you’d have to be willing to give 100% to and I don’t think I’m at that stage or if I’ll ever be. I see people half-ass their parental duties and I couldn’t do that.	0
What is something you own that is overkill for the purpose you bought it?	I mentioned to my SO that I needed a potato masher. I just had a plastic, inexpensive one in mind, but he went out and bought a Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer because he once heard it "does everything." When I laughed and said "I just meant the little handheld one!" he turned around and bought an immersion blender. I still don't have a potato masher.	I told my wife I wanted an AR15 for home defense. I ended up buying that and another upper for a .50 BEOWULF. That round will drop a charging elephant. Totally overkill but WTF not right	1
Women who went to college and "screwed up" academically, what happened after you graduated/dropped out and where are you now?	I'm in a highly competitive graduate program in a highly competitive field. It turns out you can bounce back from some pretty severe fuckups if you're willing to keep working.	I had a 1.7 GPA at one point due to repeated sexual assault one semester. I wasn't going to class to avoid the guy in the dorm doing the assaulting and my RA was his friend so nothing was being done. I did end up getting those classes removed from my transcript due to the circumstances, but I still didn't have work experience or network connections when I graduated. After 5 months of job searching I was able to find an awesome job in R&D sales thanks to an employment agency. I was hired permanently after 5 months and I've gotten a promotion as well since then. I make the same amount as my age group in the same region (who also have a degree) .	1
Whats the most ridiculous question you’ve seen asked on this subreddit?	Any question where, by the rules of the sub or otherwise, there will only be one acceptable answer, and no other reply will be seen or engaged. Topics include, off the top of my head, abortion/ minority rights/ healthcare in the US/ anything about "do women like x,y,z"	The guy that basically asked if women have thoughts and are self aware Then when he rightfully got ripped a new one, he edited it to tell us we all just didn’t understand what he was asking	0
What cultural stereotypes have you never seen or experienced, thus makes you wonder why that stereotype exists?	The stereotype that says immigrants are lazy and just want to live off welfare. (And yet somehow steal all the jobs?) I know two women who came here from Venezuela and they're both university educated and own their own businesses. My mom was an immigrant herself and she was always employed and made money as an artist on the side. The foreign business owners where I work (mall) are polite and run their stores well. The only person I know who faked a disability for benefits and stayed at home to chain smoke and chug Mt. Dew all day? My stepmother whose family had been here for generations.	As a brown guy, am I seriously supposed to think that Japanese, Chinese and Korean people are the “racist” ones? Lmao	1
If you were friends with your S.O. before you started dating, how did your relationship change from platonic to romantic?	I tried to set my now-boyfriend up with my then-best friend, only to have him reject and ghost her brutally 2 days later. I didn’t have an explanation when she found out we were dating 2 weeks following him rejects her.	We had both recently ended other relationships we were in, and moved out of a flat we shared. Two things happened: 1. Because we weren't flatmates anymore, we actually had to schedule time to see each other. That little change made our hang outs feel WAY more like dates. 2. I was pretty good friends with his ex girlfriend. This one time, we were hanging out and I was trying to figure out why he broke up with her and we just ended up spending hours talking about romantic relationships and what we each wanted in a partner. We were pretty much describing each other. I didn't realize it at the time, but apparently he did. We've been married for 5 years now. It's been great. We did good.	0
Bisexual women of Reddit, what are some notable differences between being in a relationship with a man and a woman? What about sex?	Every comment is basically saying dating women is better.. so maybe y'all are actually just gay? I don't see why you'd date men at all if you prefer to date women. But I guess the followup question is what do you like about men or dating men that makes you confident that you're bisexual and not just gay?	I feel more cared for by women. Though maybe it's just the men I've dated. For me, men are more likely to do some kind of grand gesture like buy a really nice present on your birthday, and consider "romantic box ticked" for a while. But women will send you that text before that presentation you're really nervous about, or say they found that one thing that you were talking about doing for a while...just generally consider you and your feelings more in daily life.	0
Would you ever get plastic surgery? Why not/What would you get?	As soon as I had financial means to do so, I went in for a procedure. It helped my self-image immensely. There's a big difference between "correcting" an unattractive feature and renovating one's entire body. The urge to go back again and again is a red flag. Responsible doctors should be able to prevent people in an obsessive or bad state of mental health from getting multiple procedures.	Honestly, recently I've been feeling a bit like a victim of the body positivity movement taken too far. I'm all for supporting women feeling comfortable with themselves, but I feel at times like there's social stigma attached to not being comfortable with something. Especially when you experience actual negative effects or social consequences for "not fitting" the expected mold, you can want to do some about it, and I've felt like considering the possibility of surgery has been a tough one for me because I think there's a pervasive message that women who get elective surgery are upholding the patriarchy and unreasonable beauty standards and should be expected to just "love themselves" and thereby not have to deal with any negativity from other people.	1
What books by women would you recommend to a teenage guy?	The Earthsea series by Ursula K. Le Guin, a series of fantasy novels and short stories that have won a lot of awards and are very highly regarded in the literary world. She also passed away this year, so you could make it your tribute to her. On a similar vein, Margaret Atwood has a series of post-apocalyptic novels that start with Oryx and Crake. If you like sci-fi in general this is very good stuff from a serious, respected author that has books in every genre.	Dude. Read books that are good. Don't specifically get books because it's by a guy or by a girl. The important part is the quality of the writing. Look up the best books ever written, read the classics (there's books by both men and women). But it is weird to prioritize the gender of an author over the quality of the writing. Who cares who wrote it as long as it's good.	1
What's the most unnecessary way you've been criticised for your femininity/exposed to sexism?	I don't think that wondering what posesses people to spend 100$ on their nails every few weeks is sexist. Or why on earth you would wear neon pink claws that just make daily life more difficult. I am a woman, and I often wonder the same thing. That put aside, I once had a guy yank my bottle of beer out of my hands and order me a cocktail, cause, and I quote, "pretending to like beer makes you look like a desperate slut". Apparently, women are biologically incapable of liking beer!	for YEARS, my mom was convinced that makeup was only for stupid girls. I’ve mostly trained it out of her, but I think it’s because people criticized her a lot for not being feminine enough when she was younger. for example, her coworkers used to snipe at her, a woman with a doctorate, about wearing makeup, a skirt suit and heels to work. she’s now actually interested in learning how to wear makeup (despite being absolutely TERRIFIED of mascara), but not after years of criticizing me for liking it.	0
Women who like to bake/cook: what is NOT worth making from scratch?	Puff pastry. That shit is $2 at the grocery store and will easily consume a few hours if you try to make it from scratch	Pie dough! So much easier to buy it premade, as long as you buy a good brand. Most things are better scratch-made if you are willing to spend the time, but convenience wins out for me.	1
Have you ever given flowers to a man, and if so what was his reaction?	I recently gave my dad sunflowers for Father’s Day. I expected him to be like “I’m a man, yuck,” but he immediately put them in water, took a bunch of pictures of them, and sent them to all of his friends. It was really sweet.	Nope, I find that absolutely pointless. Why should I give someone something that literally dies within a week. I’d rather let it live and give them something they can actually put to use	1
Ladies who believe women shouldn’t feel societal pressure to shave but continue to do so yourselves, what is your motivation to continue making this effort?	I like the way it looks and feels. And it doesn’t take a huge amount of time. I don’t think it’s any of my business what other women do.	I like how it looks (the same way I like curly hair, this doesn't mean I want everyone to have curly hair)	1
[Serious] Women of Reddit who struggle with mental health, how do you get yourself to practice self-care and do things that make you feel happy on bad days?	I will never be “good enough” ... But I’ll be damned if I didn’t get a lot of small things done today. I’m a failure in the big picture... But cleaning the kitchen, working on a project, and getting my work uniform clean and ironed make me feel otherwise. Baby steps. Small things. I’m not going to fix all of the mistakes overnight, but- I can keep my life held together one small piece at a time.	I struggle with mental health and have had problems with physical health as well lately, which means my mental health is REALLY suffering now lol. I love self care, and really believe in it. I make an effort to lay back and chill every single day. That could mean meditating, taking a nap, putting on a face mask, taking a hot shower, taking a new exercise class, writing, reading, watching a favorite TV show or movie, catching up with a friend, venting to someone...it really depends on the day. But self care really helps. I believe in it for sure.	1
Have you ever dated someone on the autism spectrum and if so, how was the relationship? Would you do it again?	Yes he's my life partner and father of my 2 beautiful children. Hes a hobby jumper and reads every minute he can go keep his mind occupied. He's a multitasking god lol. He's an ask and I'll do kind of guy but I'm a please pick up that I need this so I don't have to tell you kind of girl so that clashes a bit. He's pretty blunt and speaks his opinion which I love most of the time. We work well and we love each other dearly	I am actually on the autism spectrum. I have dated my ex who was also autistic. We broke up for reasons unrelated to autism. The relationship was hard, but I think half of it had to do with distance issues. It would be hypocritical for me to say that I wouldn't date someone that's autistic when I am myself. I would date someone who was autistic again if I was single, but I am married to a NT husband who does his best to understand and accept autism.	0
What is your destination for the trip of your dreams, and why?	My destination is my bed and my dreams that involve an orgy with Tilda Swinton, Tom Hiddleston, All the Chris's minus Pine, Scarlett Johansson and AppleBach McGillersash.	New Zealand to see all the filming locations from Lord of the rings! SO and I started dating due to our mutual interest in it and we're both huge fans. Trying to convince him for a cheap wedding and NZ honeymoon.	0
Ladies with chronic illnesses or mystery health issues, how do you deal?	as strange as it sounds, gratitude. millions of people around the world have chronic illnesses and pain, but don't have access to medical care either at all or at the specialist level, to say nothing of pain management, and have no choice but to work in their misery. yeah there are problems and the health system doesn't work perfect, but i can see a doctor and get my pain under control the very same day if it gets that bad, and i get a basic stipend for days i can't work. i try not to complain because damn, what some people wouldn't give.	Having a name for it and being able to find a tribe is helpful. I have endometriosis and am struggling with infertility because of it, and having other people stuck in the same boat as me helps keep me sane and cope and learn stuff. I hope your specialist helps you find answers soon. ❤️	0
Folks who live in "cool cities," what's something most people don't know about it?	After you pay your rent, you won't have any money left to eat in these cool restaurants, go to cool events or be cool in general.	Wtf Is a cool city? Is Melbourne a cool city, I think the stereotype is that we’re a war between the latte sipping hipsters and the meat pie smashing footy nuts with two sets of teeth between them. Which tbh is mostly true. Only thing they miss is our huge Greek and Italian population.	1
How do you get over the feeling of being fetishized?	It’s very frustrating. I’m a black woman so I totally understand. I think sometimes certain men see me as something to check off of their bucket list. I get to know them, follow my intuition & usually it’s not wrong. I don’t mind dating outside of my race, but when I feel like I’m just a black body part, it’s a turn off.	East Asian in ethnicity. It’s not a problem being fetishized to me. Someone can have genuine interest and also are interested sexually on the side. I treat it as any other fetish, accepting it and see it as a positive contribution. I’d much rather be fetishized than have people uninterested in me because I’m not of a specific race.	1
Who was the truly nicest guy you've ever met, and what was he like?	He adopted our friends kid the day we knew she was dying . He helped her through the process of wills and everything and made sure she didn't have to worry about the after. She spent her last days being able to do her bucket list with her child, with money he provided. He set up a trust for her child with everything he had in his savings so that she can physically see that financially he was covered. He asked her to write a book of her wishes for her son so that he can carry them out and raise him in a way that she would like. He helped her write letters and birthday cards for her son and they celebrate her birthday, mother's day, etc so that she is always a part of his life.	Honestly... All the men in my life have disappointed me, even the “nice ones”. The only men in my life I can count on are my stepdad and grandad, they give me hope I’ll find someone nice one day.	1
Whats the scoop on the current drama happening amongst your friends or family?	My cousin and her boyfriend told everyone they were getting married. They planned to just get married at city hall instead of having a wedding to save money towards a house. They posted pictured of themselves in city hall with their friend who was the witness. Afterwards, the entire family met up for dinner. During this dinner, we all gave them wedding presents. Most of us opted for cash. My grandmother alone gave them $7,000. The next week, they moved to Texas to be closer to his family. Three weeks later, it comes out that they didn't actually get married, and faked the entire thing. The "husband" got angry that she wasn't sharing the money equally and snitched to the family. All the family members have been talking this week trying to figure out how much money they scammed from us, and it's around $12,500.	My SO wrestles in a local ladies amateur wrestling group. Her wrestling partner is unhappily married and has been having an affair with me (my SO and I are in an open relationship). Unfortunately, my SO's wrestling partner recently confessed her love for me; I broke the wrestling partner's heart when I rejected her proposal to leave her husband to be with me. My SO was understandably upset by this proposal. Consequently, there is now a real adversarial tension between my SO and her wrestling partner that has been motivating their incredible wrestling performances. *"Woah, they really seem to hate each other! They are phenomenal actors!!"* tldr: My life is basically the Netflix show GLOW (except I'm not cheating on my partner).	1
What was the most unwanted/unsolicited comment someone made to you?	A bartender asked for my ID, then said, "that was a compliment, you're supposed to thank me.". I walked out.	"Ayyyy, big dude!" Yes giant scary biker guy at the gas station at 3am, I am a fairly large guy. Please go away now.	1
How often do you swap for a clean towel for showering and why?	I use one for my hair and one for my body and wash them every week with my sheets. I only wash my hair like once or twice a week, but take showers more often to at least like rinse off any sweat, shave, etc.	Every day. I never knew there's people who use the same towel for days on end. Seems absolutely disgusting to me.	1
Redditors that have both children and neices &amp; nephews, how does your parenting style differ from that of your siblings?	I'm definitely more free-range than my sister. My 13yo son has never done anything to cause me to hover (come home late, not answer if I call him) so I pretty much leave him to his own devices while my sister insists on knowing exactly where hers are going, with whom etc	My sister formula fed used cio started solids super young that sort of mom . I breast fed til 18 mos didn’t introduce solids until 6 mos never used cio , I’m big on car seat safety . So we’re pretty opposite .	1
What moment made you realize you're not okay?	First time I tripped acid and felt like I had seen everything in my past/present I wasn’t emotionally dealing with.	When I [M21] bought a $300 black revolver on my credit card, had in-n-out for my last meal, and hiked to my favorite view at 1am. I only put 4 rounds in it, in my version of “Russian roulette”, spun the drum, and pulled the trigger. I said I’d give the universe one chance to save me, and it did. Sometimes I regret not doing it anyways. That was 4 months ago. I’ve since quit my job and moved back in with my family. Started anti-depressants and talk therapy. I come from a family that doesn’t believe in doctors, so getting help has been hard. My mom said she doesn’t believe me, even though I gave my dad the gun for safe keeping. I didn’t tell them I pulled the trigger, just that I came really close to doing it.	0
[Serious] mothers of Reddit, do you ever regret having kids and why?	No I have never regretted having my kids, and enjoy my life more with them now. We are all into a routine, eat healthy, me and my husband hardly drink anymore. We try to keep weekends free to do family stuff. Also my age gap rule was, not to have a 2nd child until the 1st is toilet trained. There was no way I was changing 2 sets of shitty nappies. My eldest was so independent when the baby arrived which made life a lot easier. It’s definitely fun having little people running around the house.	Several times a day. I also swell with love for them several times a day. I like my kids, I don’t like momming.	0
What is something you always wanted to try and thought you would love, but then wound up hating once you tried it?	Houmous. I thought I'd love it, but that stuff is not fit for human consumption. The same goes for avocados. Wouldn't even feed it to the pigs.	When I was a kid I used to be obsessed with little house on the prairie and there was a time when Laura ate maple syrup covered snow and it sounded like the best thing ever. I tried it, of course with crappy fake syrup and it was so disgusting. I was so upset that my beloved Laura ingalls wilder betrayed me	0
What male fashion trends do you hate?	Shorts that sit above the knee. They look awful on any guy over 13. Man buns. Eww. Socks and sandals. Not really a trend but something they do sometimes.	Baseball caps with the stickers still on. Why leave the stickers on? Why?? Also, guys who tuck the tops of their ears into their caps. I never noticed this until my husband pointed it out. Now it’s the second thing I see, after those goddamn stickers.	0
Unattractive women, what is the worst social experiences you’ve had due to your physical appearance?	Probably the insults from people driving by in cars. Most of the time it's when I've been walking into a store from the parking lot but one day I was in my garage painting a dresser with the garage door open and it was people driving by my house. There's just something extra insidious about it when you're just minding your business at home.	In middle school, a group of girls started talking shit about me loudly because my legs were super pale. When I was a kid, an old man came up to me and told me I was so skinny that when a big wind blew, I'd be blown away. Actually a LOT of people comment about how thin I am. When I told someone about my fertility issues, they told me it was because I'm so skinny. I get a lot of comments about my weight. Always have, always will. Stopped caring, because my husband finds my body type sexy.	1
What is your experience with getting permanently sterilized when you haven't had any children?	I did it at age 43 or so. Got the Essure sterilization procedure, the same week that folks filed a class action lawsuit against it (sigh). But I've been fortunate - haven't had any problems, haven't had any pregnancies. I wasn't given much hassle about getting sterilized - despite being childless, being recently divorced and in my 40s may have made it less controversial.	It's fine, I would just say if a person is really young, that they wait a few years to make sure it's something that they really for sure want. I've read that it can be very difficult to get a doctor to even agree to do the procedure for someone so young.	1
Who was your worst manager and why were they so terrible to work for?	My worst manager was a woman. She spent her life making mine hell. She took an instant dislike to me. I was very young at the time, maybe 18/19? I remember she tried to keep the entire store of us for overtime on Xmas Eve with no warning, telling us we wouldn't leave till all the markdowns were complete and the store was fully ready. My sister called bullshit, came in screaming at her for me since she was meant to be meeting me from work, ended up quitting the job new year!	When I was working at an ice cream place for a few months. He was in his early/mid-20s, and I was 16. He hit on me all the time, made really inappropriate comments, and was just a gross dude. I would turn him down, and he would only schedule me for shifts he worked...the owner wouldn't ever do anything. But I was 16 and didn't have a good homelife and quitting meant spending more time at home, so I didn't consider it. Then once I was in the back with him helping him restock some dry goods (we were closed) and I turned him down again and he raped me. I went to the owner the next day and was fired. I can't imagine working in a situation that bad again.	0
What is something that people always get wrong about your job and career?	People think I don’t have a heart, but I do. Huge heart. Bigly. Biggest heart you’ll ever see. All the hearts. Everyone...you know...they just don’t understand why myself and PutinKGBlovin get along so well. Probably because of the Fake News Media. - DJTrumplestiltskin	That I understand all aspects of the law, will give legal advice, or will just affirm whatever shitty opinions you have. I'm a lawyer.	0
What are healthy women actually eating?	Why are you just asking a bunch of redditors? Did you expect one answer? If you want to learn how to eat healthy, every major medical organization in the world has basic guidelines. And those guidelines are all the same. They’ll vary in how they phrase it (“make half you plate fruits and veggies” vs “eat 5 cups of fruits and veggies a day”) but it’s universally the same basic advice. And frankly it’s what you know already. You KNOW when you’re eating junk food. You KNOW you should eat your greens. There’s no magic, just common sense.	I just try to make every meal at least 50% veggies, and the rest kind of falls into place. So breakfast might be a veggie scramble, or veggie frittata that I made earlier in the week and rewarm, or potatoes with veggies. If 50% of a meal is vegetable, it's hard to go wrong and you will likely be eating pretty healthy.	0
Women who married their SO early in life, how is your marriage currently?	I said falling in love not breaking up. Second, this is MY opinion based on MY own experience. OP asked a question to get opinions not to look for a right or wrong answer. Glad to hear you are happy based on the choices that YOU decided to make.	My husband and I were high school sweethearts. Started dating when I was 14 and he was 17...got married when I was 18 and he was 21...we’ll celebrate 32 years together this coming November. Our kids are grown now and we actually connect better now than ever. I think it’s because we’re older and realize how precious life is so we try not to take each other for granted. We talk about everything. If either of us has a problem or disagrees with the other, we make it a point to communicate rather than lose our tempers/jump to conclusions. I came from a really f**ked up childhood and my husband has been the most patient, loving man...I got very lucky! 🍀❤️	0
What is the nicest thing someone's ever done or said to you?	My mother was ailing and it was the day before she passed away. I had lost my sister a few months before, and was caregiver to both through their illnesses without any close family for thousands of miles. One of my cousins sent me a huge delivery of frozen gourmet foods. This thing was amazing. I felt so loved and cared for. In the days and weeks that followed, I was able to defrost and cook as much as I needed. It brought a new meaning to the phrase “comfort food.” Also, that particular cousin and her sister really stepped up for me and are now two of the closest people in my life, even though they live far away. We were never super close before, and now we talk a few times a week.	Nicely put, we were on spring break and playing truth or dare. This girl wanted truth and someone asked “out of this whole room (about 6 guys and 6 girls) who would you want to fuck the most?” “Oh definitely skullyD, 100%.” Was nice to hear.	1
What kinds of questions make you immediately suspicious?	Who is your childhood super hero? What is the name of your third grade teacher? What is your mother’s maiden name?	How are you today? Especially when it's out of the blue. I don't normally get asked unless someone wants something from me.	1
Who’s the worst guest you’ve had in your house and what did they do?	This one is more humourous than anything, but I had houseguest who ate my entire birthday cake without asking, and then ALSO ate the replacement birthday cake that my friends/roommates bought out of pity for me not being able to eat my first cake.	A guy who brought his Rottweiler, drank beer all the time and played his guitar way too much. The night before their 8 hour drive home I fed the dog canned chili.	1
What's the best vacation you've been on?	A few years ago, I booked a two week solo trip to the Philippines for the sole purpose of scuba diving and beach bumming. I spent almost every morning diving (it was literally like Finding Nemo under the water) until about noon, then spent the afternoons reading on the beach. Then at night, I would sit down and dine with random cool tourist from other parts of the world that came to also dive. It was so relaxing and just a ton of fun.	Great Wolf Lodge in Sandusky, OH. You can drink beer while the kids play and my husband and I and the kids all got along perfectly nobody was grouchy. My kids are old enough now to sit down in a restaurant and eat so that made it really nice. I love vacation.	1
What's the meanest thing you've done that you DON'T regret doing?	My old roommate moved out without warning and paying rent so I got her car towed when she was moving. She moved about an hour away so while she was gone with the uhaul, her car was towed away from my home	This girl I knew for some time came to hang out. A virgin at the time, I decided that she’d be the one to lose it too. Turns out she was a wet towel in bed. Just laid there and took it. No enthusiasm or emotion what so ever. The next morning I told her I had got called into work. Walked her out of my apartment, said goodbye, got in my car, drove around the block, saw that she left, and went back inside. Never spoke to her again.	1
Is there someone who keeps coming back into your life in a quasi-romantic context, but it never seems to work out due to timing, geography, or other factors? What does this person mean to you, and what keeps drawing you to each other? What keeps you apart, and what do you make of that?	Yep, the first guy I ever dated. I was 13 and he was 19, didn’t work for obvious reasons lmao we talked on and off for 6 years, we’d talk for a few months and get really close then he would start an argument and not talk to me for a few months, then do it all over again. it wasn’t until the last time we talked that I realized I was completely over him. I was only attracted to him and liked the attention from him when I was a young lonely teenager, now as an adult I realize he’s just pathetic. It’s been almost a year since I’ve blocked him on all social media and I haven’t been happier	Someone I’ve known 8 years. It began romantically for about 2 years but didn’t work out—more of his volition as he would lead me on then would realize he didn’t want anything serious. We weren’t friends for a bit but gradually started being friends again as we got older, and I did not see him as that same person as before, and we have been best friends for the last 3 years. We emotionally relied on each other and I trusted him (my mistake). He recently did the same thing as years ago—led me on, then realized he didn’t want a relationship. I finally realized I deserve better from both a friend and a potential partner, and said goodbye, as much as that hurts. I never would have imagined my best friend would use me like that again, after all of our history. Sucks.	0
Women who have become doctors/tried but dropped out,would you recommend med school and why?	I wouldn't recommend against it to someone who wanted to be a doctor, if that makes sense. I don't think it's a career you can choose easily - the money isn't worth the stress and hours of exhaustion, and if you're in it for noble causes there are other professions that can fulfil that noble need without draining your savings and mental health (NB: as much). I would recommend lots and lots of shadowing and work experience. Get an idea of what medicine is really like. When shadowing, try to do a long shift or on call shift so you see the end of the day, shitty parts of it. There are loads of medical specialties and you don't have to know right away which one is the one for you, but it's good to experience them all and understand that there's a big variety.	I considered med school and now I’m in dental school because among other reasons I want a family. It wasn’t because I’m not smart enough, I had a 4.0 in undergrad (you don’t have to believe me, I don’t care, it’s anonymous). I didn’t want to spend 4 years in school then bust my ass in residency when I could love what I do and be out in 4 years, and start practicing and making great money, and start a family after my debt is paid off with my eggs being healthy (statistically of course -lol)	1
Have you ever stayed in a relationship after your partner cheated?	Yes and it is ALWAYS a mistake. Don't ever take back a cheater. Even if they don't cheat again (which they definitely will), you're still always going to have that worry/doubt in the back of your head. People deserve better than to stay with partners who've cheated.	I ended a relationship when my ex-boyfriend cheated, but then got back together with him after a little while. It was absolutely not worth it. He was genuinely remorseful and never cheated again, but he still treated me badly in a lot of other ways, compared me to other girls a lot, and made me believe that his infidelity was my fault. If someone disrespects you in one way, they will disrespect you in others.	0
Whats your favorite podcast/what podcasts are you listening to?	My favorite podcast ever is ‘Guys We Fucked’ it’s two female comedians who explore sexuality by interviewing a wide variety of people. They are helping erase the stigma of slut shaming women for being proud of their sexuality. It’s so funny and amazing! Definitely worth a listen. (You’ll end up binging many episodes like I did)	'Reply All' is a super interesting podcast which talks about all sorts of interesting subjects and they also investigate a lot of stories themselves which the discover about online.	0
What are the 3 things you wish you knew before going to university?	That I was an introvert, and therefore would not enjoy dorm life. That the value of going to university is actually the networking. ...Don’t have a third one.	1. You are a woman. 2. Get in to therapy and please choose an LGBTQA+ friendly one. 3. If you still fail, it's *okay.* You will be fine.	1
What was your worst "nice guy" experience like?	I had a guy who tried to follow me to Europe and told all our friends we were in a relationship when we weren't. I told him repeatedly that we were never going to be in such a relationship, but it took him almost three years for it to finally sink in. I knew he finally heard what I was saying when I got a nearly incoherent stream of drunken texts from him saying that he's a great guy because he never raped me while I was drunk but also threatening to come over right then to rape me to show me that he's a "real man."	Was a nice guy, got her out of credit card debt, saved her from an abusive relationship from her family, helped her finance her last year of school fees, all the while she was telling me that when she loved me and was ready to commit to a relationship when she got out of this bullcrap mess. At the end of it, she ghosted me, i sent her 4 angry msgs scolding her for using me and to go fuck herself. 2 months later found myself on a collegehumor post on being “that edgy nice guy”. Thanks life i seen it all now	1
Women who left their spouses at the altar, what happened?	My last two fiancees lost their minds before we could get married. Mental health is hard. Hopefully, third times the charm.	He had been abusive and was an alcoholic. He cheated on me and blamed it on my family and tackled me when I tried to leave. So I played along and agreed we'd get married in and move to another state away from my family. I was supposed to meet him there and get married the day I arrived. I never got on the plane and changed my phone number and quit my job.	0
"What female character tropes/types bother you in fiction?" is a common topic. But which ones do you really like?	Obnoxious super moms that are disrespectful to men and don't believe that they're capable of simple child-rearing or house-keeping tasks. The ones that treat their husbands like children and disrespectfully talk to them like they're idiots. It makes women look horrible and its pretty pervasive.	I love when female characters are smart and perceiving - like Skylar in Good Will Hunting. She is caring, but not overly sensitive. And she is smart, but not judgemental. I often think female characters are either completely controlled by emotions, or completely emotionless.	0
What surprising thing did you learn about a loved one after they passed away?	\[not a happy one\] That he had raped his two older daughters when they were single-digit age or thereabouts. I'm the only one of -my- generation in my family that knows; everyone in the generation before me knows.	When my grandma died we found out that she had bought rings when each of her children and grandchildren were born. The rings had their birthstones and she would wear the rings at every special event for that person. She did this so when she passed we would have something that reminded us of all the great memories we had with her instead of all the memories we would never make. We would be able to wear these rings and know she was with us. There are many pictures of her at my birth wearing my ring, at my heart surgery, my birthdays, my graduation, and no one thought anything of it because grandma looooved her jewelry.	0
How much does your SO match your initial idea of the kind of partner you were first looking for?	My “ideal” was always the on-the-go powerful businessperson with many degrees, the “life of the party” person who owns a room the moment they walk in. I dated a lot of them probably because I grew up around a lot of them. My SO never went to college, is happy with his life, and would rather cook with me and have people over for dinner than be out at the fanciest restaurants. He’s amazing. It turns out I needed a sweet nurturer more than a powerful leader.	I would say 85% of what I initially was looking for, before I knew exactly what i needed from a partner. Now knowing everything I need, he meets that for me.	1
What career is a deal-breaker when it comes to an SO?	Part time job holders/ can’t hold a job down. Anyone who works in jobs like emissions testing. I’m not about to be supporting a giant child who blames everyone else for their problems and lack of money. (Really bad experience with a SO who was like this) and anything to do with stripping or sex. Those just seem like really nasty jobs, for a guy to have. Although I would be fine with a female who owns a strip club, females tend to have a lot more restraint and respect than the average man	I'm a pilot and I wouldn't date another pilot. Been there, done that, didn't work out. It's hard enough when one person in the relationship is in aviation, let alone both.	0
Bridesmaids: What are some things that your brides did that really upset you?	For her bachelorette party she chose a casino and buffet- $55/person 2 hours from where I live. I'm a vegetarian and all I could eat was a shitty salad. I also had to bring my 4 month old son and SO to help care for my baby. The party started at 7 and by 8 pm I had to leave because 4 MONTH OLD BABY. The wedding was even worse and I don't even want to go there.. But bottom line is I hate weddings.	I feel like a unicorn sometimes, in that the weddings I've been in (or adjacent to) have all had brides who were the same wonderful easygoing people (if more stressed) that I was friends with to begin with. No complaints whatsoever. One thing I learned from my own wedding, though, is that there can be such a thing as "too chill" to the point that it becomes unhelpful. We strongly didn't want our small wedding party to have to buy new matching clothes, so we told my sister/MoH and sister-in-law/groomswoman to just "wear blue," and told our best man/ushers to "wear whatever." This led a couple of them to freak out at the lack of direction, and we ended up having to give some more specific guidelines after all.	0
Women who made a career change/went back to school in their 30s, what do you do?	I became a commercial pilot. I had hit a plateau in my previous career at 32, and after a divorce, just took a hard look at my personal happiness. I started the transition about 2.5 years ago while still working my other job, and made the leap to being paid to fly about a year ago. I love it.	I tried out a lot of things in my 20s, none of them stuck and I felt miserable. Turned 30, went fuck it because life is too short, went back to uni to do something creative because I'd always been a creative person. Life became much happier - and I'm now doing a PhD in music!	0
What types of “Red Flags” do you see in yourself, and how do you go about mitigating them?	I have a hard time communicating how I feel and tend to blow up on people when they think things are fine. It stems from wanting to please people being afraid of alienating others through confrontation. As I get older I’m becoming more comfortable with being candid about my feelings.	I’m super insecure and quite clingy, (although far from controlling). I do a lot of therapy and considering that most of my insecurity comes from being male, that’s getting less as I start to more openly transition.	1
Women who lift weights regularly and make exercise a habit, do you expect your partner to be the same (ie., a guy who has some level of musculature and is fit)? Or would you date them regardless?	I work out regularly but I do that for me. I enjoy what I see in the mirror and the appreciation on my partner's face. I wouldn't complain if my partner was also active but I love me a nice dad bod. He doesn't have to be cut, so long as he's healthy. And sized right in all the right places haha.	I don’t care if my partner has a 6 pack or not and I don’t expect them too. I just want them to be healthy and take care of their body :)	0
Women who lost/gained a lot of weight or whose physical appearance drastically changed -- how have people treated you differently, if at all?	A few years ago I lost about 70lbs by choice through diet and lifestyle change. I noticed that strangers are much nicer to me in general now (holding doors for me, offering me their seat on public transport, and positive customer service interactions). I've been catcalled at more which I have still not gotten used to. It makes me very uncomfortable. I put more thought into showing less skin now which was something I never really worried about before.	I’ll always be a fat girl at heart.. not literally “fat” but the trauma or memories attached to my past with my weight will keep me humble forever. Lost about 20-30 pounds after high school and also lost body fat and turned to muscle in the right areas.. was always invisible to men in the past and Sometimes I even felt like girls wanted me around to make them look prettier. Now I see that the tables have turned, those guys are scrubs and hit me up randomly, and girls seem envious of my new found confidence within myself. It’s revenge at its finest without me doing or saying anything to them. Oh, also I get job offers much easier than before which really upsets me at times with how society works.	1
Why do you think teen girl culture is hated so vehemently?	There's this expectation for girls to be mature adults ASAP, and teenage girls having interests that are just for fun undermines that. It points out that they actually are still children, just as much as their male counterparts.	Because it's terrible? Everything is superficial and shallow and so many people act like cookie cutters of one another if it's what's popular. Follow this trend, follow that trend. Being dumb for a laugh is the "in" thing 90% of the time, and what's not to hate about that?	1
What do you dislike the most about online dating?	The fact that it's so dangerous. Dan the cute and cuddly may very well end up being Dan the rapist or Dan the murderer. This is a risk in normal dating too, but I find red flags easier to detect in person. Creeps can't hide their true selves as well in real life as they can online. Meeting strangers from the internet feels like an incredibly bad idea to me.	As an introvert, I felt like online dating had a lot of positive aspects - first and foremost that I didn't have to go out and be social. I know a lot of women get inappropriate messages but that only happened to me once - and it was simply "you're going to hell" (because I'm an atheist). Other than that, I have to say that I found it to be a positive experience overall. My SO and I met that way and we've been together almost 5 years now.	0
People who grew up in a "bad neighborhood. How aware were you as a child that you lived in a bad neighborhood?	I was aware that we lived in a bad neighborhood when a guy died right in front of our house and the cops came by to knock on the door to ask if we had seen anything. We weren't home at the time that he died, but I was about 8 or 9 when this happened.	Undercover cops were parked in front of my house a lot for years until my neighbors were finally arrested. I wasn’t allowed down the street alone, ever. My older brother walked me places with a bat or golf club. My neighborhood had a curfew. I was a little aware, but not really. Not until friends from school started to come over and comment.	0
Women in STEM fields, what instances of sexism have you faced at work/school?	I’m a college student majoring in computer science. Luckily, I haven’t gotten too much trouble because most guys in CS are excited to have a girl there, lol. I have had guys doubt my coding skills though. When we’re working on a group project and I suggest a certain technique, it will sometimes get ignored only to later be brought up again by a guy. And everyone listens to him. *smh* But really, I’m happy to say that I haven’t experienced too much sexism. Edit: Side story, I had a guy say to me that he was glad to see so much female empowerment in this one movie we were discussing. The movie had of a lot of degrading sex scenes with women, and he thought it was great that they were “exploring their sexuality”. *Sigh*	Whenever I interact with the public, the questions I receive are way different if I am alone or with a female coworker compared to when I am with a male coworker. When with a male coworker, they always default to addressing him when asking questions even though I know much more about the project. They also tend to ask more in-depth questions. When I'm with a female coworker or alone the questions are always really basic or just something about how cute the wildlife I study is... I also have had issues where the men at work take credit for my ideas. They will take my suggestions and present it as their own idea.	1
Do you ever miss the person you used to be?	I feel like I am not as nice and sweet as I was when I was younger, however you know how the saying goes...”different people bring out different sides of you”	Not really. Honestly, I'm a far more improved version of myself than anything else, because my tastes haven't changed. I'm still a damn giant nerd with an obsession with cute stuff. My confidence & stuff has gotten better.	0
What's the biggest style mistake you have made?	Early 2000s were a wild time to grow up so take your pick, really. Vertical striped flares in corduroy, cut up biker shirts, shiny cargo trousers, gold mesh disco halter tops, asymmetrical jersey skirts, striped and ribbed turtleneck jumpers, flowy dresses over flared jeans, shrugs (I mean what am I, 80 and at the opera), super low rise jeans with belly chains, camo everything, Avril Lavigne as a style icon, ties as belts, etc. I was a disaster and that was before I went emo, which was even worse.	Not listening to my gut about abusive men. Which sucks, because I love humankind, I believe in us, & abusive men take advantage of that *every* time.	1
Did you grow up with honorary "aunts" or "uncles" who you are not actually related to legally or by blood? Who are they and how did they come to be a part of your (chosen) family?	Uncle Chuck! He was a regular when my dad ran a gunsmith and sporting goods store. After it went under, they started hanging out at home a lot. Dude was always awesome to me and my sister, treated us like nieces. We are adults now, and he still gets us Christmas and birthday presents.	I'm not sure if this is what you're asking, but when I was a kid I was best friends with this one girl, so I went to her house a lot and I always called her parents auntie/uncle. I don't talk to her anymore, but her dad is my dentist so I guess they're still a part of my life today (saving me from cavities lol)	1
Clitoris-only orgasmic women, what positions and/or methods do you employ during vaginal sex to ensure you orgasm?	Surprised to see no one saying on top. I’m a CO orgasimer and I can only make it to the top of the mountain while on top. Doesn’t happen every time but the natural rubbing of the position mixed with my SO squeezing my bum is the only way to get there	Missionary, despite my love of kink 😆 Ahem. That way, penus/toy is able to hut all the right spots & I can just focus on using my Hitachi wand. I can't imagine using anything less. It's either that or the weight of my hips. But hey, I hope to find other positions & things that work ^.^ (Also also, people who only orgasm from clit stimulation is like, almost all of us)	1
Women who love their job, what do you do and why do you love it?	I work for a handbag designer as assistant designer! I love my boss who has been like a mentor to me after graduation. Its a small company so I get to help out with everything from design to social media to inventory. Its a lot of low risk problem solving that I love!	I am a housewife. I love it for the following reasons: 1. Setting my own schedule/routine. 2. Don't have to deal with other people 3. I'm old fashioned and believe it should be someone's job to care for the home. If nothing else you want it to be a place you're proud of. 4. More time with my husband 5. He can come home and rest instead of having to cook/clean/do laundry. 6. I have time to meal plan. Sometimes we don't do that, but it's nice having the luxury. 7. We will have children in a few years. I will get to be around them 100% and not miss anything. There are other reasons I love it. I could write a book, but I don't want to, lol.	1
Women who debated between having a large wedding and having a small, casual wedding, how did you eventually decide?	I’m unmarried but have attended a sufficient number of Indian weddings. 600 is small for us, so you need to specify your idea of small.	I looked at our budget 😂 But seriously, we had about 60 wedding guests and were able to spend quality time and talk to all of them. We had only people we currently talk to and are close with; no obligatory invites. It was the best and I have zero regrets.	0
Single women who wants a relationship but never found anyone, how do you cope up with loneliness?	I live in the Bay Area, so I got two jobs to pay for my apartment, and now I have no free time. But I do have a cat, an extensive library, and a really nice apartment all to myself. I also bought a high end vibrator.	I envy people who can be happy not being in a relationship. I’m definitely not one of those people. Luckily I found a great guy and remarried 3+ years ago at 46.	1
Any adult women out there willing to admit they were one of the “mean girls” in high school? If so, how do you feel about that now, looking back?	I was definitely a mean girl growing up. I was the girl who was nice in your face and talk shit about you and make fun of people with my friends. I don’t even think it was coming from an insecure place, it was just something my friends and I did to make each other laugh at others expense. Even now I sometimes find myself being that petty mean girl always laughing at someone. I try to stop myself but I feel no way about it! I hate to say it I don’t feel bad, that was just the page I was on! My friends and I just love to laugh!	In middle school there was this girl who was an outcast that no one ever hung out with or extended friendship to. Looking back, I did not say anything when others would look down at her. I was picked on a bit during that time but people still hung out with me so instead of putting myself out there I just let it happen. I've recently facebook stalked her and she seems happy and normal so I'm pretty sure it was middle school pettiness that was the issue, not her. I still feel a bit guilty sometimes thinking about how lonely it must have been back then... Especially since I know how it feels.	0
Sweaty/stinky women of reddit, what is your holy grail antiperspirant + deodorant?	Mitchum. I’ve been using it since I was 13. 31 now. I have used Dove, Secret, Degree, Toms (ugh I hate this one), Speed Stick whenever I had wanted to try something new & I always go back to Mitchum. It’s just a clean scent & I never feel like I need to reapply.	I don't use antiperspirant because it's not that great for you. Deodorant wise I use a men's old spice with deodorant only. They have some that include antiperspirant but I avoid those. The fiji scent is pretty nice and they have other scents that aren't to "manly." Sometimes I have to get it online because a lot of stores only carry ones with antiperspirant.	1
To those with SOs that work long hours and come home tired regularly: what can they do to reassure you they love you?	So let me get this straight: The person who works long hard hours and comes home tired is the one responsible for the other persons lack of self-esteem?	My bf heats water for my tea when he gets up before me, always comes in to wake me up/say goodbye (depending on my plans for the day) and lastly ALWAYS cuddles me for a couple of minutes when he gets home so we can talk about the day and such	0
What movies/tv shows do you have a hard time watching due to its sexism?	The Sandlot. I just watched this for movie night for the first time with my husband and three sons. I was upset enough to not finish watching the movie and to tell my husband how upset I was that he didn’t pause to talk about consent and sexual assault after the lifeguard scene. Plus there were the insults degrading females...	I used to love Funny Face... until watching it a few days ago and now seeing it as a film about a man who uses his position of power to manipulate and take advantage of a naive girl half his age. And because he realises that the man the girl is actually interested in is doing the exact same thing, somehow that makes him a hero? He even tells her "he's no more interested in your intellect than I am!" and we're supposed to be rooting for them to get together? What the actual fuck?	0
People whose S/Os are considered very attractive, what are your best stories of them getting hit on around you?	My dad was *super* good looking as a young man. He was extremely popular with the women-6’4”, athlete, thick dark hair, clear blue eyes, and a true southern gentleman, too. My mom tells the story of a time when they went to an upscale restaurant for an anniversary dinner early in their marriage, and this woman nearby was staring and ogling. It continued until my dad looked deadpan right back into her eyes and picked a booger right out of his nose. So out of character for him and to my knowledge he has never done anything like that before or since.	A "friend" of mine kept talking up my husband at the gym. I felt it was bordering on emotional affair and I told him so. Stopped that shit immediately. Another time, this (different) "lady" (I like to curse and that's not allowed here I just figured out) tried talking to my husband for an extended period of time at a festival that *I* organized. Then proceeded to have my husband "help" her get her things into her car. My husband is mild mannered and doesn't seem to know how to "shut it down." It's very annoying.	1
What beauty habit/tip really upped your attractiveness level?	Getting a tan. I don't even feel like I need make up when I have glowy tanned skin. Getting a short hair cut (side cut with little hair flipped on the other side) combined with large/antique earrings. Face jewelry (like a lip piercing)	Always wash your face and brush your teeth before bed. Always always always, no matter how much partying you did that night.	0
Ladies, what life lesson did you learn recently that you wish you had learned sooner?	To pick my battles. I used to be the kind of person who got worked up about every little thing and really went hard on discussions and arguments. I've always been really stubborn, so I guess it stemmed from that. Anyway, I've since realized that not everything is a hill I want to die on and sometimes you just need to step down and not lose your mind over every little thing, specially when dealing with certain people or certain topics.	That some ladies are too pretty to be friends with. They only befriended you to make them look cool and everything. Some guy friends only used you to get to the pretty friends. So yah i learnt my lesson that pretty face doesnt mean a pretty heart.	1
Do you ever feel like you're living your life to be Instagram worthy? As in, you want to participate in activities that show you have an active social life? How do you combat this?	No. I would like to get my selfie game back, though. My girl friends all post amazing selfies all the time and they're so gorgeous but I just can't be arsed to take the time to snap 100 photos of my fucking mug until I produce something decent.	I deleted most of my social media accounts. "Out of sight, out of mind", as they say. Never looked back.	0
Instead of the worst or scariest, what are some "meh" or "so-so" dates you've been on?	Asking questions like pulling teeth. I'd ask what he liked to do, or what his job was, or what sort of food he liked. 1 word / 1 sentence answers.	I went on a couple dates with someone in a wheel chair once. The guy was super nice and super handsome, good family and everything. He was super fun too, and the wheelchair didn't phase me. But the spark just wasn't there. He was absolutely amazing though, whichever lucky lady ends up with him, God bless. You're in very good hands.	1
What’s romanticized in modern culture but really shouldn’t be?	I wouldn’t say romanticized but I DESPISE how being late is becoming normalized. People who are consistently late to everything in their lives baffle me. I don’t know how you expect to hold a job or even hold onto your friends if you keep disrespecting them by completely disregarding time management because it’s “cute”.	Having a bigger house. My 3 bedroom ranch house is enough for my family. If I had more kids than I would need another bedroom but think we're done with two. It also doesn't break my bank. I can afford my mortgage and extra stuff BECAUSE I haven't 'moved up'. People at work are always whining about how broke they are, but I'm sure their mortgages are 1.5x what mine is. Sure we could afford a bigger house, but why? So that our bank account can't grow? So that I can say my house has 4-5 bedrooms and is 3500+ sq. feet? Doesn't seem important to me.	0
Taken from r/AskMen. What are some uncommon signs of immaturity in a man ?	I consider a man to be immature if he is unable to take criticism or any sort of feedback that isn’t positive. How one handles being told they’re wrong or doing something incorrectly says a lot about them. If they react with anger or denial, it shows they’re too immature to admit when they’re wrong or don’t know something.	Calling their mom "mother" exclusively, I don't mean like "my mother" when speaking formally. I mean all the time even when you have never met their mom the still say something like "Mother and I used to visit that farmers market all the time." "Mother used to cook me this dish every Sunday." I am sure their are exceptions to this but both of the immature and abusive men that used to be in my life did this and it has stuck with me.	1
what's something that has made your life significantly easier ever since you started doing it?	Washing my clothes. I read a comment on Reddit that in order to improve your social skills you should first take care of your appearance. I don't own a washing masheen and I'm sort of a clothes hoarder but I'm very OCD about which clothes go together so it's very hard to get dressed in the morning that I just ended up wearing the same outfit as 2, 3 and 4 days ago. I washed one of my outfits in soap and warm water in the bath tub and people actually sat next to me on the subway the next morning!	I started doing Yoga a few months ago and life is easier. I feel stronger, have better posture, carry myself better. I used to always have to have the TV on because I wasn't comfortable sitting with my own thoughts for an extended period of time. Now I love silent moments with myself and I think I'm a lot mentally healthier because of it. Sometimes I drive with no music on so I can be with my thoughts. &#x200B; Also the "two minute rule" is a good one. If it takes less than two minutes, DO IT NOW don't think "I'll do it later." Wash that dish, put that thing back in the drawer, pay that bill. Stop leaving everything to "soak" cause that shit piles up and becomes un-doable once it's a pile of dishes, metaphorically and literally speaking.	0
Those of you who grew up poor or without regular access to hygiene products, what’s the most ridiculous thing you’ve had to do to get through a period?	It was the 90s. I'd been given a large carton of teen magazines from the 80s, clipped the free sample coupons from the corners of the carefree/tampax/etc ads and posted them all. For months I was getting free samples in the mail, daily. The samples lasted me a coupla years actually, the only downside was finding a use for all the "tampon hiding" containers and wallets they all sent with the products!! Now, as an adult in a better financial position, I make sure we have plenty of sanitary products for myself, friends and guests and my daughters also have their own stash for when the time comes. They've also been told clearly that those items are a priority, as much as food staples, and that there will always be money to buy them.	Why hasn't anyone used paper towel? I mean bounty is the quicker picker upper... They show people pouring gallons of liquid and it holding. Wouldn't that be a no brainer?	1
Have you ever clicked with someone perfectly and enjoyed each other's company so much, but realized that a long term relationship could never work out? How did you accept that and stop longing to be with that person?	Haha I am married and have these two ahhhhhhhhhmazing guy friends that I know I can never be with. I often fantasized about it and wondered if I’d ever leave my husband for either one of them but I quickly realized that my husband is the only one that can put up with me. 😂 plus they have different personalities too - there are certain aspects to their personalities I am absolutely in love with that my husband lacks. But what I realize is that it’s okay - there are people in your life you’ll meet that fullfill different sides of you and one person can’t be perfect. So I am quite happy in my circumstance. Blessed to have my friends and my husband it makes my life complete lol	I read a ton of books. Didn’t put pressure on myself to find someone new right away, and treated my heartache as if it were the flu—a physical illness that would be soon to pass. Then I let myself get better and took precautions not to have more pain than necessary— like cutting all contact with him and restarting my life with a new, stronger outlook.	0
What's the absolute worst pickup line you've ever had to listen to?	It was from me: I spot a twenty-something gal at apartment complex pool reading a physics textbook. Me, a fresh college electrical engineering grad (and somewhat fat) see my chance: “I have some physics books in my apartment if you’d like to sometime come and look at them!” I don’t remember exactly how she said no, but it was tactful and polite. I think she moved out shortly after. I’d like to think I had something to do with that. Update: twenty+ years later and I’m not thin by any means, but not nearly as fat, and I don’t have the textbooks anymore. So all female sciences majors, you’re safe to read in public again.	First, and last, interaction ever with this bloke. I'd been sitting at a bar with my friend who left to go to the loo and he sort of saunters up (he had no business sauntering, let me tell you) and goes, "my cock just died, can I bury it in your pussy?"	0
Which aspects of dating culture do you think needs to permanently retire and why?	Defending racial preferences and blatantly discriminating against others because of said preferences. I was also guilty of this at one point.	I really hate the idea of having to act like you’re less interested in someone than you actually are in the beginning stages out of fear of them losing interest in you. I want attention it’s not fair lol	0
What fictional relationship influenced your view of romance the most and in what way?	Morticia and Gomez are more or less #couplegoals. They make an effort to maintain the excitement and passion in their relationship, they support each other, and they accept each other's weirdness.	zutara. (zuko/katara from avatar the last airbender). they were perfect. literal true love personified as far as im concerned. one of the most important questions i think i could ask a potential partner is whether they think katara should have ended up with zuko or aang. i think it shows two completely different ideals of romance, and if someone didnt hold the same ideas of what made a good, strong relationship as i did, i dont think we would be compatible.	1
Have you been right about having a bad feeling about a friend's boyfriend? What's your story?	Yes. I have a friend who was in a ldr with a dude living in a different country. they had been together forever and i was a newer friend so i didn't really want to say anything, but the way he treated her rubbed me the wrong way. He made her cry way too often during fights and I would hear stories about all of his close friendships with teen girls at his work. &#x200B; She did all of the work getting him to our country and on their wedding. About 9 months after the wedding he left her with a lot of debt and with claims that he was abused. to top it off he told her he was having second thoughts about the whole thing BEFORE she got him over here.	It's bad being right and doing nothing, it's worse doing something but being wrong. Makes you look like a saboteur. I guess it's best to be careful.	1
Cold &amp; flu season is upon us! Ladies who never get sick, what are your secrets?	I attribute my low carb diet and increased water intake to a lot of health benefits - losing weight, reduced anxiety, next to no migraines, better sleep and a tougher immune system. Whether it's true or not, I have no idea. But whenever I'm eating this way, I don't get sick. I used to constantly.	Flu shot works wonders for me, vitamins don't hurt either but I usually forget to take them. Lots of hand washing too!	0
What’s your best ethically gray life hack?	I learned this while working with kids, but it's remarkably effective with adults as well (morally grey because it can be manipulative depending on situation): In a situation where you're depending on someone to make a decision, give them two choices (both of which are beneficial for you). Most of the time people will just pick one of the choices instead of presenting an alternative that might be less desirable for me. So if I want my partner to do a chore I'm avoiding, I might say "would you rather scoop the litterbox or empty the wastebaskets?" Chances are he'll just pick one of those two instead of suggesting a different chore he'd rather do, whereas if I asked "which chores are you going to do?" he probably would suggest a chore I'd rather do myself.

Women who have done sex work, what specifically did you do and why did you do it?	I was a phone sex operator for a month. I did it because I was unemployed and needed the money. The income sucked though, I think I earned like $800 that month, working 7 days a week, 12 hours a day. I hated the job, and to be honest, it turned me into a misandrist and someone with a permanent chip on their shoulder, something I’m still working to get past.	I’ve sold videos of myself, been a cam girl, and been a sugar baby. I did it/do it because I can make a ridiculous amount of money. I’ve never had any negative experiences.	1
When did you realize you were funny and how do you think having a good sense of humor has helped you in your life?	I realized I had a good sense of humor when I got to college. I make a joke out of anything good/bad. It’s how I cope. After opening up to some peers in college about life in general. While some people laugh it off, over the years I’ve been told multiple times “How are you laughing at this? You should go see someone.” I began to think if I didn’t have the humor I have today, I’d probably be depressed and suicidal. If you live to talk about it tomorrow, you can laugh at it.	I grew up homeschooled and always felt like an outsider. I tried to fit in by blending in as much as possible, but if anything it made my desperation more obvious. At home, my family communicated through quirky, dry sarcasm. Eventually, I started to let a little of that slip out. When people laughed, I suddenly felt more accepted than I had ever felt before. Just thinking about the times I've been called "funny" is more precious to me than any award or achievement. In a way, it's limited my ability to communicate in larger social situations. It's my fallback when I'm feeling insecure or fearful of judgment. But I think the trade-off has been worth it.	0
Women who work 9-5 or equivalent, what’s your morning routine? Do you rush in the mornings to make it to work on time?	Everyone here is making me realize I need to get my life together. I work 7am-7pm. I usually snooze my alarm until 6:20. Brush my teeth, wash my face, put my hair in a pony tail and put on some mascara. I leave at 6:45, so I usually get to lay back down for another 10 minutes and then think about how much I’d rather die than to work.	i work 10-6. goal wake up time is 7 to 7:30, 8 at the latest. i smoke a cigarette first thing and take care of the dog next. then i set aside what i’m going to wear for the day because i always end up inevitably rushing at the end because i’ll end up goofing off. after that i do something with my hair, brush my teeth, and start my hour long makeup routine. then i leave at 9:30 so i can get iced coffee and get to work a little earlier so i have time to chill before my clients start coming in. (i work in a barber shop. )	1
What is your #WhyIDidntReport story?	He and I were both equally drunk. If I can't be held accountable for my actions or words when I'm drinking, then why should he be? **Edit:** Just to clarify, mine was only attempted assault/rape, he wasn't successful in his efforts. If he had actually done the deed or if we'd been sober, I would have reported.	Because the very next morning, 9/11 happened and I didn’t think what happened to me was important enough compared to what was happening to the country.	0
What’s the fastest you’ve quit a job? What was the reason?	First fast food job I ever had was 22, Was there 1 hour on 1st day, got Arby Sauce on my new sparkly white tennis shoes, cried, quit, went home. Lol .	Two days in retail. I hate when jobs lie about the position and it turns out your job relies on opening credit cards.	0
What was the final moment when you knew you're in the wrong relationship? What was that 'little moment' that told you it'll never work out?	He came home from work and declared that some guy “tried to rip him off”. Upon further review.. guy was supposedly one of his good friends, he had loaned him $5, and was pissed that the guy didn’t pay him back that day (on payday). Sounds super minuscule, but it was something so small and he played the biggest victim over it. Talking about how he hopes his “friend” rots in hell, how dare he try to rip him off, “no one gets away with disrespecting me like that”. It was $5 for lunch to a friend/coworker that, in the beginning of our relationship, he had claimed was one of his best friends. That’s when I knew I couldn’t put up with that kind of... whatever the fuck it was.	When he told me he lved me... I laughed. Not once did I ok pause. I didn't and never did live him..	1
Women of reddit. If you could change one decision you made this year, what would it be?	Moving to a new city and committing to a guy I met 3 days in. I had no support and his family embraced me and helped me with my son while I was working nights. I was never in love with him just loved him. It went on for 9 months, too long. I finally made the decision to break up with him, ultimately crushing him, his mother, and my 8 yro. And he wouldn’t let me keep the dog we “had together” that he bought on Mother’s Day that I had been wanting for months. My son and I miss his mother and the dog more than him.	I would have worked harder to find a job that suited me. No one should find themselves in a job they want to quit after only a few weeks. I feel like my college degree is useless when my job could just as easily be done by anyone with a basic knowledge of data entry	0
What’s a weird food combo you made up as a kid and still love as an adult?	I don’t think it’s wired but cut up cut up. It’s of bacon, boil spaghetti noodles, mix. Definitely a long standing drunk food as well.	My sister and I used to dunk Hot Cheetos in sour cream cuz they were too spicy. Now I dunk em cuz it tastes delicious.	0
Those who need them, do you prefer to wear contacts or glasses? why?	I wear contacts for many of the reasons mentioned already but one weird perk is that my eyes don't water when I'm chopping onions with contacts in.	Glasses. I can't stand putting stuff in my eyes, and I've been paranoid about then not being able to get them \*out\* or getting infections.. The worst thing that can happen with my glasses is I smear something greasy on them or have to adjust if watching TV lying down (I keep an old pair as my emergecy spares as my eyesight is pretty bad)	1
Ladies, what are you sick of seeing on dating profiles?	Exotic travel photos, anything materialistic, Camo, or pics with their kids in them. I wish you only got ONE photo for a profile. Get really tired of album overload.	The one that always bugged me was 5 group photos, and then wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses in the only solo photo. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHICH ONE YOU ARE???	0
Boss women of reddit, what has been your strangest reaction to your position of power?	Honestly I wish stories like these flooded twitter rather than angry feminists who don’t actually help the problem and discredit real issues by drawing attention to their own victimization.	I've had a male subordinate who was doing poorly tell me he needed a new boss because I was "too like his mom for him to respect." He did not receive a new manager. Nor did he keep his job.	0
I feel like we hear a lot from women who KNEW they either wanted or didn't want children. Those who were very much on the fence, how'd it turn out?	I was pretty convinced I didn’t want kids before I met my husband. I have a couple hereditary health issues and I’ve always thought that they simply weren’t fair. When I met him, I found out he also has a few and it’s one of the reasons we work so well together. One day, it clicked to me. I was afraid of forcing a child to potentially face some of the difficulties we had both faced, but if they inherit those things from us, they’ll also inherit our determination and perseverance and will be able to face anything. In short, I was afraid to have children until I met someone who brought out enough strength in me to change my mind. We are planning on starting fertility treatments in the spring (hey there hereditary health issues) and we will see if it is meant to be.	I’m ambivalent, and always have been, and I’m reaching the age where that’s a choice in itself. If I’d ever had a healthy and stable relationship with someone who really wanted a kid, I probably would have been open to having one. But my SO now is as ambivalent as I am, and I’ve never gotten knocked up accidentally (if I did, at this stage I’d probably keep it), so here we are. And that’s okay. My dad always told me the only reason to have a kid is if you truly knew you wanted to be a parent. I’ve never known that, and so I think at the end of the day it’s right that I never have, and probably never will.	0
How do you deal with body insecurities e.g. belly fat when getting intimate with your SO?	Obligatory not a woman. So, as a lurker, here's my two cents. Relationships are about communicating. If there's something about you that you're insecure about, and you're with someone you love, poor at least want to build a relationship with.. You need to communicate these things. If your SO cares about you, then they'll help reassure you that your internal holdups are your own, and they don't share your view. It'll not only help bring you closer, or weed out the unworthy, but also help you heal from your insecurities. Though, this isn't first date material, so YMMV 🤷‍♂️	If they didn't like what they saw, they wouldn't be interested in getting intimate. Plain and simple. If you feel like you're not sure, you can communicate to them "hey, I'm kinda insecure about x part of me." Chances are they'll have words of comfort. Believe them! Remember they have free will and they choose to get intimate with you as much as you choose to with them. Think about it from their POV. You're probably not analyzing their body during this time, so why would they be scrutinizing yours during this time? You're in a heated moment and chances are they're not looking/paying attention to that and/or they just consider it part of the whole sexy you.	0
What's your "did I really just get hit on?" story?	whenever I get hit on when I have no makeup on, put 0 effort into my appearance, it’s actually pretty nice because I don’t feel pretty if I’m not all done up... and I’m rarely ever done up lol.	​Shopping mall toy and gift shop, I'm looking at cute stuff. Guy walks up to me. 'You looking for toys for your kids?' Thinking he's an employee, I say 'Nope, just browsing' (I'm just a grown woman who still likes toys, sue me). 'Huh. So, you married?' I look him over, realizing he doesn't work there. 'Got a boyfriend, but yeah, pretty much' and flash him the ring I wear to indicate as much. 'But are you happy?' he asks. 'Yeah, I am, very much happy', I say, while thinking what the fuck, he thought I had kids and wanted to hit on me, then heard I'm attached and thinks I'd wanna cheat?! Then he asks this whopper - 'Don't you feel this chemistry between us?' 'No,' I say, 'I don't.' '​You don't?' (sounding baffled). 'No.' He walks off looking sincerely gobsmacked.	0
What’s a popular book, old or new, that you found disappointing due to its poor portrayal of female characters?	I didn’t really like The Awakening or the Yellow Wallpaper. Both are important early feminist works that capture how trapped women were by the bounds of society but I prefer my main heroines to be fearless tomboys (like Jo March from Little Women) or badass ambitious types like Becky Sharpe (Vanity Fair) or Scarlet O’Hara (Gone with the Wind). Or even gritty survivors like Rukmani in Nectar in a Seive or O-lan in The Good Earth. I guess I like positive, optimistic and determined characters rather than retiring and depressive Emily Dickenson/Sylvia Plath types. The women I’ve known in life have been more in line with the former	Haruki Murakami is a very creative guy, but his treatment of women in his novels is definitely not great. Very few of them seem to have any real agency of their own or act in a way that resembles an actual woman. They're more of lust objects than people. And he's definitely guilty of those oft-parodied, unnecessarily booby descriptions.	0
Women who have had cosmetic surgery, what did you do and what were the side effects?	I got my boobs done, and just as another poster said-any self esteem issues were gone over night. (Of course this will vary for people, due to different issues) I was a 36B and got 600cc silicons HP unders. I’m 6’0 FWIW. I feel like God just forgot to add tits to my formulation, so I feel pretty great, now.	I got double eyelid surgery in Korea. I got into wearing double eyelid tape (common trend for Asians with single eyelids) when I was in high school, and unfortunately had the bad habit of not properly removing the tape correctly. So my lids got really saggy and I got them corrected. Very happy I got the surgery done. My eyes look pretty natural, I like how they look now. :)	0
Women who dated/married a man you settled for, why?	I never believed in marriage. I met my now husband on Tinder and i instantly knew i was going to spend the rest of my life with him. We only got married because we’re both from different countries. We didn’t make a big deal out of it. In the End it’s just a sheet of paper. But it was more than that. I feel like our love has grown stronger and deeper since we’re married. I thought the opposite would happen. I couldn’t imagine anyone else by my side and i feel like the luckiest woman in the world to have had caught the most living and caring Husband that goes out of his way every day to make me happy :) hang in there. Real love still exist	It was identical to my parents relationship - we were always mildly irritated by one another, never really romantic with each other. I thought that's what relationships were because of my parents. Then I found my current partner. Even after nearly 10 years, it still blows my mind that I have such loving emotional support.	0
Folks who've dated someone with ADHD, how did it impact your relationship?	As a man with ADHD who feels great shame every time he forgets one of the issues generally talked about here (usually "chores") etc and works really hard to curb all the other ways it pops up that could be seen as disrespectful, this is really disheartening and a little condescending. We aren't children	I feel like I parented him and it made me anxious as I always worried how impulsive he would be or if my needs and wants were actually being heard. If anything was wrong, it would be completely ignored and it would treated as unnatural if I wasn’t in a good mood within seconds, and he couldn’t wrap his head around it. I assume he’s a fixer. He dumped me because he couldn’t handle my low points and said it made him anxious. I’m still very much feeling the aftermath of it.	0
Divorced women: looking back, what were some red flags you ignored while dating/the first couple years of marriage that ultimately ended up being a crucial mistake?	He was not very patient or understanding. E.g. yelled at me for something petty on our wedding day. Yelled at me the first week after I gave birth to our son even though he was sleeping all night while I was up every 2 hours. Never got up overnight to change diapers. Was just generally mean sometimes. Sadly I wasnt the one to ask for a divorce. Spent money on big ticket items he didnt need. even though When consulting me I said please dont do it. When I told him I was finding this unacceptable and we needed to go to counseling (mainly the name calling) he asked for a divorce a week or so later.	This is going to hurt. His passcode was his child’s mother’s name. And guess what I still married that dumb fucker. Divorced 5 months later.	1
What’s your holy grail when it comes to treating acne scarring/dark spots/dull skin?	Loads of fruits, veggies, and water. Stay away from fried foods and touching your face. Wash your face regularly, but don’t dry it out.	aha (alpha hydroxy acid) serum. there are lots of different options, the one i use is pretty expensive (drunk elephant tlc framboos) but i haven't found one that works nearly as well on my skin	0
What’s the worst job interview that you ever had?	Interviewed for a marketing job at a smaller company in oil and gas. I asked about company culture, how laid-back the office is, etc. The lady told me every two weeks, if their sales team meets the quotas, they get to wear jeans on Fridays. She looked at me and smiled and said, with 100% seriousness, "We have fun here." Did not get hired there and glad about it tbh.	I was asked how did I hear about the job? Why do you wanna work here? I replied my friend works here!!! I guess that was really bad. Then I said it’s very convenient and practical. This wasn’t a CEO position I don’t understand why they thought me living close and having a friend who works there was such a bad thing!	1
How do you forgive yourself for the bad and hurtful things you've done when you were in your early 20s and younger?	My therapist helped me see from a perspective of a witness. By understanding the reasons I did whatever hurts and wrongs to others was because they’re something I had learned from my direct environment. Anyone in my position would do the same, because the only training I got was that, and that was the best I could do, at that moment. No matter how much I wanted to change what had happened, I cannot. But I can learn from it, accept it, and change what I will do in the future—this is where my therapist came to help, her role is to give me a positive reference point, a way out of my past choices to how I actually wanted to act, to think, to believe in my own skin—and I am grateful for having taken the step towards realising it in my current life.	If you keep beating up your past self, how do you expect your present self to ever be healed? As long as you’ve grieved and learned from your mistakes, it’s in your best interest to forgive yourself and move on. Imagine what you would say to your best friend if they shared how much they’re struggling with old mistakes, and share that healing love with yourself. Everyone goes through this at some point, it’s part of being human.	0
Those of you who have had an affair with a university professor/lecturer- what’s your story? How did it happen and how did it end?	Not quite the same but I once had a student ask me to get dinner at the college cafeteria with them. It was hella awkward, and I didn't know what to say, so I said "No thanks, I'm not on the meal plan."	When I was a hot 20-year-old guy, circa '72 when the Second Wave of feminism was on, I took a women's studies class. The professor was about 30, attractive, single. I needed to speak with her about my paper. As a joke, I put on my sexy clothes, the sleeveless t-shirt and the short-shorts that were slit on the sides up to the waist. I entered her office, closed the door behind me, and said in a mock-coy voice "I'll do anything for an A." (pause) "Just kidding, I need some help with my term paper." She was slightly amused. Got a B+ on the paper, if memory serves.	1
Ladies who have gotten out of a toxic relationship, how did you do it?	I pried to God to send me a sign/something which give me the ability to say : game over. The next day, the thing happened. And then I refused any contact (phone, visit, etc?) from that person for at least 1 month. It worked. Thanks, God! I believe God exists and if we really really want something, it will happen.	I was with a horrible guy in my teens, super emotionally abusive. At some point, his jealousy got so bad that I physically screamed when I recieved one of his texts and I threw my phone against the wall. So out of character for me. I then thought, it's been three years and he brings out the absolute worst in me. I stopped responding but I won't lie - it took *years* to fix the mental damage he did to me. Last year I started dating a guy, but saw the same signs... The jealousy, the gas-lighting (along with an alcohol problem). I'm older now, smarter, I can see the signs and I've worked too hard on myself to go down that road again. I ended it after three months.	0
Today is International Women’s Day, we’ve got a long way to go, but in your lifetime what are the changes you’ve seen that have made life better for women?	In my lifetime, I think things have only gotten worse. Before I was born, some strides were made. I think feminism made improvements in the 1970s, but things have gone back downhill since then.	It sounds fickle, but I really appreciate having more women creators influencing pop culture. Especially for things like comedy. I LOVE that there are female comics out there making jokes that I can relate to now. It seems like such a small thing - but characters like Liz Lemon? Absolutely priceless. I’ve also really noticed it in music. When I was a teenager I liked rock, and it felt like the only “credible” rock stars were men. It’s just so amazing seeing female artists (eg. Camp cope, Courtney Barnett) with guitars being badasses and singing songs I can relate to.	0
What moment made you look at your SO and think, "Wow, they must really love me"?	So i’m a pretty picky eater and extremely emotional. I also hate veggies, so one time we went to taco bell and i asked for no lettuce on my tacos. we get home and of course there is lettuce on my tacos. I completely lose it and start crying. I feel like kinda a big baby for crying over lettuce being on my taco, but my wonderful SO who puts up with all of my cry baby moments, told me it would be okay. He picked off every piece of lettuce on my taco and returned it to me. I felt so grateful to have him and in that moment thinking, who else would have done with for me? I ate the taco even though it had a lettuce taste to it.	I'm allergic to cats. I found out he gives his a bath every time I'm going to his place so there's less dander and I dont have such a bad reaction. I hear bathing a cat is not for the faint of heart.	0
What is a healthy alternative you treat yourself with after a bad day or heartache, rather than chocolate cake or junk food?	I know most people are suggesting alternative food items, but I usually just give myself extra bodily pampering instead. I’ll take extra steps in my skincare routine, like a mask, teeth whitening, do my nails. Maybe go to the spa, get a massage. Helps to feel cute and taken care of on the outside, at least.	~~How about starving myself?~~ Nah seriously that's it. I don't have healthy coping ideas except for maybe rewatching your favourite tv show.	1
How did your parents/family fuck up your relationship with food?	I never got to eat spicy food, so it took me well into adulthood to handle it. Of course, when I discover I love it, I'm also old enough to get nasty acid reflux. THANKS MOM AND DAD.	starting from 2nd grade, my mom weighed me every single morning before school, and most of the time after school as well. if my weight wasn't to her expectation, my lunch would change. she kept it written down on a chart visible to everyone in the family. there's a lot more, but that's probably the biggest one. i learned from the age of 6 to be very ashamed of my fat, ugly body. it was on me, the 6 year old, to somehow know proper nutrition, despite the fact that my morbidly obese mother did not teach me anything.	0
Have you been a creep to someone? When did you realize it?	It was never revealed to the guy, but after we split up I memorized the last 4 of his phone number so if he called or texted I would know it was him, but I deleted his number so I wouldn't be tempted to reach out. We got back together 8 months later but I never told him about it. My friends swore it was creepy.	I don't know how creepy it is, but I tend to look up people I'll be working closely with. I generally don't let that be known, but with one student who joined my lab, I slipped and mentioned his lifeguarding during a meet and greet supper. He hadn't mentioned that he lifeguarded and was genuinely confused. And called me out on it.	0
What is the long term impact of having been in a sexual 'relationship' with an adult man as a teen?	I was 15, they were mid twenties/ early 30’s. Lovely men, I’m so glad my teenage sex drive was focussed on actual men not spotty oiks. Nothing negative at all. That came from the lad only a year or so older.	I was 17. He was 28. He was a family friend and he insisted we keep the "relationship" a secret. He was very controlling and abusive. He raped me multiple times. In the end I thought he would eventually kill me. My family eventually found out after I had tried to break up with him. He told me he wouldn't let me do that and just carried on with abusing me. The fallout was surreal. My family "forgave" me for "seducing" an older man. (Thank you evangelical Christian upbringing) I had developed a lot of shitty coping mechanisms to survive him that served my future abusive boyfriends very well. I lived with untreated anxiety and depression for 14 years. I nearly killed myself a couple of times. I finally got therapy in my 30s and started unravelling the whole situation. I'm better now, but still broken	0
What are some great cooking tips for someone in college, you wish you knew earlier?	Look up prison recipes. You think I’m joking. Inmates know how to make some pretty tasty stuff with vending machine foods. It’s impressive lol	If ur on a budget add some spices and fresh veggies to ur 99¢ ramen and u have some gud soup	1
What podcasts do you listen to and what do you gain from them?	I really enjoy Guys we Fucked. It may not seem like it from the title but its taught me so much about myself, my sexuality, and life in general. They have some pretty great guests on there too and aren't afraid to talk about real and controversial topics on top of the more raunchy episodes.	*This American Life* is like walking through a portrait museum of people who are both ordinary and captivating. They put an incredible amount of intention into transforming obscure people and events into short stories. I feel like I get to meet all these incredible humans in my living room.	0
at work, how do you ask someone nicely to do a task themselves (when they're trying to offload it on to you when they could and should do it themselves)?	This is something I had to learn how to do. They’re not asking for help because they’re struggling, they’re just being lazy. You just look at them sincerely and say “I’m sorry, I’m busy in my stuff right now. If you have questions because you’re struggling, I can do my best to answer them for you.” It’s not your job to do someone else’s stuff.	“You are the fucking worst” and then it’s a game of forget chicken and whoever remembers first has to do it. Not the most effective but it’s worked for 2 years	1
Ladies! How do you get over feeling ashamed of being “sexual”? With the way media portrays sexually tuned women as “whores”?	Damned if you do or don't. Just gotta live your life and own your self. I found people who were so focused on a narrow idea of how you need to be are just not worth sharing shit with.	Someone once told me, "You're either a b**** or a whore. Pick one." I decided right then that I'd rather be considered a b**** than a whore anyday. My morals keep me on the path that I want.	1
How has your body changed after pregnancy?	Boobs are less gravity defying, small tummy pooch framed by stretch marks on either side, both my kids are boys and since having them I now get 3 little black hairs that grow just beneath my bellybutton haha and a few hairs on my lip grow in black, my hips are wider, but the acne and skin on my face has improved.	I have stretch marks, weird boobs, and a little tummy pooch one year PP. But the thing that fucks me up the most is the constant back pain. Thank you, shitty epidural nurse.	1
What was life for you like before and after taking antidepressants?	Before: Massive mood swings. Hyperactivity, irritability, anxiety, and bursts of productivity and creativity followed by long periods of lethargy, apathy, hopelessness, self-loathing. After: bizarre behavior, paranoia, and thought I had 6th sense type superpowers. Turns out I had bipolar disorder, not depression, and so I needed a stabilizer, not an anti-depressant. After stabilizer: I have virtually no symptoms anymore. I have a full range of emotions, but my emotions and energy level are just...normal. There was no perception of “it’s working!” because nothing felt remarkable...which is actually how you know it’s working. Sharing because sometimes the first diagnosis and/or first prescription isn’t right for you, but the next one might be better.	Before: crying fits for hours, several times a week. Sitting down and looking at the wall for who knows how long. Barely went anywhere. 2 meals a day. Now: a couple crying fits a year. I'm aware that my body needs 20 mins of rest after work, and that's okay. I plan and go places. 20 meals a week.	1
You're at a job interview and they ask you, "what is your weakness?" - what would you answer?	I want to figure things out on my own and sometimes have trouble asking for help. I address this by giving myself a time limit. I have 20 minutes to figure this out and if I don't have it by then, I have to go ask questions.	Stealing money and giving out trade secrets. You know when I am just standing there next to money I just can't help throw tons of it in my pockets and when someone ask me about confidential information I tell them in detail, you know to help them out, also I enjoy a good helping of sexual harassment in a work place so if people seem calm I will grab someones butt to put them on edge, you know normal weakness /s	1
What "grass looks greener over there" decision did you end up regretting?	Reconnected with a guy whom was not even in my friend group in high school, on fb. After some time, ended up hooking up and my SO of 5 years asked me point blank if i was cheating on him a few days afterwards. I told him the truth and we ended up breaking up. He was emotionally unstable and took his own life less than a week later. Since then my life has been a downward spiral. I will never forgive myself or be able to get past what I have done. The grass is definitely not greener. I’d give anything to get back what I had. But I know I don’t deserve him. I’m toxic and tortured with guilt and shame. Everything has changed.	Leaving a job, city, home, hobbies, life that I was happy with for a "better" role. It just didn't go over well. I was making more money, but I had been significantly happier before.	0
Global check in: how is everyone with anxiety/depression/chronic pain doing today?	My new disabled parking placard came and I'm downright gleeful. I know people complain about handicap parking, but as someone who frequently can't walk well or without severe pain, I would gladly bash your ankles with a metal bat and then have you walk from the back of the lot to the store to see if you get it then. If not, I already have the bat. Head it is.	Not good, I'm on my period and it's making me feel extra bad this time, like I'm just angry/irritable and crying for no reason. I would think it's PMDD if it was a regular thing, but it's just confusing to me because I feel off.	0
Coffee shop employees, what are your pet peeves that you wish customers would stop doing?	Asking for their "usual" when they haven't been in that many times. The employees get to decide if you have a "usual". They'll let you know by calling out your order before you say anything, or asking if you want your usual order, etc. You don't get to just declare yourself a regular on the 3rd day in a row that you come in when you haven't even met all the employees yet.	Don't hand me your coffee mug. I don't know where it's been. I don't know how often you wash your car cup holders and if it was in your purse/bag I KNOW that's never been disinfected. Sometimes if I have my cup a a barista will insist on taking it for me to make my coffee and I always bristle at that... no thank you. I'll dump it in later. I just tell them to make it in a mug for dine in and dump it in myself so I'm not wasting any disposables	1
In all honesty, do you think sex is overrated? Why?	Cause getting to orgasm is like a maze sometimes and other times it’s a straight shot. When the partner isn’t up for it, I’m better of taking care of myself.	Yes and no. I mean, I have a high libido and will choose sex over almost any other activity. I still feel like a lot of society (and media) overplays the general importance of sex (gotta be having it!) and just how amazing it is (gotta do anything to get it!). If my SO left me, I'd certainly miss that part of the relationship, but I'd survive.	0
Has anyone here been in an emotional affair and willing to share their story? How did you heal the relationship with your partner? How did you manage having strong feelings for someone other than your partner?	Well I was an emotional cheater, but I made the choice to leave my boyfriend at the time. We had been together for a few months, but not connecting. I chose to end the relationship and pursue a new relationship with the guy I had emotionally cheated with. He’s in the other room. Nearly 14 years later and we’re married.	I never had an emotional affair but I had met people that I was insanely attracted to on deeper level while being in a relationship. I acknowledged to myself that yeah I was attracted to that person but there're billions of people in this world. You'll bump into others who tickle your fancy more than your SO. I just don't do anything about it and probably stay aloof from those people not to get myself into any situation that will hurt my partner.	0
Women who regret having children, why?	My 6 year old just yelled down the stairs at us that his older brother (9) is being mean because he's not letting him snore. My eyes met my husband's and I read him the question, he thought y'all should know. I always wanted kids, I couldn't wait to have my own babies. I love my kids and go the extra mile for them. My eldest has been on probation. I'm raising my crazy sister's teen daughter in addition to my 5 biological kids. Boys eat and break things. Girls hibernate and have attitude. Sometimes, I threaten them with abortion. /s kind of.	I don’t regret having kids but I do dream about that elusive world wherein I had my current resources and wasn’t tied down by motherly duties. I have a great career and I make good money, but my husband an I live in another country than our family which implies that we don’t have much support if we ever want to take a break. Yeah we can hire a babysitter every now and then for a date night but the thought of even taking a weekend trip together is laughable. We are so prudent about our vacation days as kids fall sick or school holidays etc and we often have to save time off for such exigencies. I haven’t ever spent a night without my kids and even the thought of it exhausts me.	0
Redditors who have completely start over in their late 30's, what did you do? How has your life changed?	What does this question even mean? Start over? You don’t start life over, you begin new chapters. This is exactly what is wrong with society & never being satisfied. Self love and acceptance is vitally important in life..don’t think in terms of being late to the party or missing an opportunity. It’s all about growth and self acceptance. Namaste.	I waited until I was 41 to flip the table. I left my 19 year marriage and started over in a new town where I had just a few friends. Lived there during the divorce process, but never really found my feet, and ended up moving to ANOTHER new town in response to a job offer. That was a place where I knew no one, and moved with just a tiny trailer load of stuff. That was 8 years ago. I've had to learn how to date as an adult, establish a career from scratch, make friends, collect enough stuff to fill an apartment, and figure out who I am as a single person. And I've done pretty well, honestly. My life now is a good one.	0
For sexual assault survivors, did you have trouble calling it rape due to the circumstances (i.e. he claimed you consented but you don't remember)? How did you get over that, or did you?	I definitely have a hard time calling it rape. He was my boyfriend at the time and I would have consented to most (not all) of it had I been sober, but I was so drunk that I couldn't even hold myself up. I broke up with him shortly afterward for other reasons but for a few months I kept trying to talk to him and wanted to get back together. It wasn't until a year or two later when I was starting to have issues being intimate with my husband that I admitted to myself I had been assaulted and it could be affecting me. I'm ashamed of what happened during the assault but I'm just as ashamed of how badly I wanted him back afterward.	I have difficulty calling it rape because it started out consensual. And while it very quickly turned into me saying no and him doing stuff anyways (followed by violence and not letting me leave), I have a hard time. Nor did it necessarily affect me. I have moments, but nothing debilitating. I also kinda just went along with everything he did, as a means of self preservation. So in my head, because I wasn’t resisting, I don’t feel like I was victim. I called it a bad one-night stand for a long time, until I described the night to my husband, who informed me that it very much was something more.	0
What’s the best thing you’ve said to stop unsolicited d!$&amp; pics?	A guy sent me a pic of his dick when i was like 16 and then asked for pics of me, I told him I was 11 and needed to ask my mum if it was okay first. He freaked the fuck out	Am I the only one who doesn’t get unsolicited dick picks? Or any for that matter...? Hubby really needs to step up his game 😉	1
For those that write in a personal journal/diary and that go back to read it, what have you learned about yourself?	From going back and reading a diary from roughly 4 years ago, I learnt that I had been battling some form of depression/anxiety for much longer than I initially thought. I've also learnt that more often than not the gut feeling that I have and write about turn out to be correct!	I go back and read from years ago. And I finally learned that time does dull a lot of things. Lost relationships that used to bring me to tears won’t anymore. I feel like it gives you perspective as to what the big feelings are that have stuck with you. And it tells you what was just situational small stuff. Also my memory is crap. I really don’t remember things I apparently experienced.	0
When was a time you thought “this person definitely likes me”, only to find out you were completely wrong?	Like almost every time I liked a guy in highschool. RIP. But i guess especially Chris. RIP. swore he was flirting and even our group shipped us, but then he started dating this one other girl	I was interested in a friend at university. He would accompany me on little errands and seemed to reciprocate my flirting. I asked him on a date, he said he wasn't interested in dating me. I told him I found him attractive and would be very interested in a FWB arrangement. He rejected that too. Said he wasn't interested in sexual activities outside the context of a serious relationship. We actually did wind up dating for several years, though he didn't ask me out until many months later when I was starting to meet others to try to get over him. I think he was shy and concerned I wasn't serious about him.	0
How do you avoid feeling lonely as a single adult? When you do feel lonely how do you get over it?	I'm a pretty solitary person, but do get lonely sometimes and it can be tough. Today I'm having a bit of a lonely day, Sundays can usually be tough as this is the day I have the most downtime and will think about it. I go on Reddit and talk to people, try to immerse myself in something that will make me not dwell on it like reading, go for a walk and listen to a podcast, or just get out of my place for a bit.	I go into the next room and say hi to my wife Edit: my bad, I didn't realize what sub I was on. Sorry for the rudeness.	1
Do you believe social media has normalized dramatic changes being done to yourself, such as a nose job or body changes? If so, has it affected you in any way?	I don't think it has "normalized" it, really. We still see hundreds of comments slamming women for having work done. We still see hundreds of people calling anyone with work done "fake." But I think it is helping us reach a point, that will not come any time soon, where plastic surgery is no longer a bad thing because women are becoming more honest about it. It has not affected me. Another woman's decision to have work done has nothing to do with me and I applaud all of the women who are not ashamed or hiding it.	I don’t know about the general population but I’ve certainly seen a lot of youtubers and instagram posters (who are already young and beautiful) getting Botox, fillers and other cosmetic procedures. It seems like it is pretty much expected for them at this point. It’s disconcerting.	0
What’s the stupidest thing someone has argued with you about?	I have always been the instigator of stupid arguments. I once argued about cultural appropriation with my mom as she doesn’t believe it’s a real thing that can be bad. I always feel bad when I remember that argument because it was kind of pointless. The problem is that I love debating so I have a hard time not arguing about stupid stuff sometimes. Also one time I argued with a girl I didn’t know well while I was on a long car trip with her about how Japanese people eating whales isn’t ok (she told me her grandmother eats whale) and she got pretty mad at me which made for an awkward rest of the trip... and I don’t know why I bothered arguing about that. I need to avoid talking about politics with people.	Arguing with a dude who said women should always get a small separate bed to sleep in when they are on period because they cannot sleep in main bed with their husband or boyfriend. Life wtf.	0
What tv/movie relationships did you once adore, but now look back and it's totally toxic?	How about Totoro and those two children? He only interacts with them when no adults are present. In secret. He also takes them for rides without their parent's consent or knowledge. What a creep.	My Best Friend's Wedding didn't age well for most 2019 sensibilities. Cameron Diaz is a college junior who is dropping out to marry a 28 year old? Are we supposed to want a "cat fight" over this mediocre man?	0
Do you ever find yourself lying in bed unable to fall asleep because there are too many things on your mind? If so, what is it that makes you ponder?	I frequently lay in bed and agonize over stupid shit I've done. Or I get too excited about fun things coming up that I can't sleep.	Yes. I experience hypervigilance a lot. Occasionally I take a sleeping pill but I find that the nerves overcome the sleeping pill and then I am just groggy as well as stressed. Mainly during this time I try NOT to let the thoughts come to mind that keep me stressed and awake; that bother me. So I’ll read instead.	1
What do your breakdowns really look like?	As soon as I get home: ugly crying, burrito-ed in bed with all my pillows. Before I get home: a dead, blank stare and more RBF than usual.	A really ugly, hard cry alone in the shower. When things are REALLY bad I don't want to see or talk to anyone until I can let it out alone.	1
What perfectly normal thing annoys you?	People who pronounce often as off-tehn. Soften the “t” in often. Take out the hard “t”. You wouldn’t say sof-tehn. Do the same with often. I’ve heard presidents, scientists, and journalists put a hard “t” in often and they sound like idiots. Very aggravating.	Office culture. It's like being on a first date from 9-5 every day. No one is truly who they are in real life because that shit would not fly in real life. All fake interaction and have to be friendly with people you'd never associate with in real life.	0
What’s the smoothest way you’ve asked someone out/been asked out?	dinner after a bad exam I had a bus at late hours so asked if we could dinner to make time for my bus also that after math exam gone wrong sadness makes anyone want to eat out	I worked in my school library part time in high school. New kid came to the front desk and we were chatting. He slid me his number on an index card and said he was hoping to check me out. EDIT: Those of you PMing me are very sweet! No we didn’t date. My long time partner was cute in how he asked me out too. We were making out for the first time and all of a sudden he pulls away breathing heavy (asthma). Between bursts of air he frantically says “can I ask you out?!” I said yes. Big pause. Then a very breathy “will you go to dinner with me?!” I said yes. Lots more enthusiastic asthma-inducing kissing after that.	0
How do you learn to accept that a relationship is over, and they're never coming back?	You've got to realize a couple of things and take them to heart. 1. They don't want to be with you. 2. You don't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you. 3. Forgive them for not being the person you wanted them to be.	If the person unequivocally told you it was over, then you do not want to run the risk of having a personal order of protection against you. Also, think about this: why would you want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you?	1
What has been your experience with "right person, wrong time" relationships?	I don’t believe in the whole “right person, wrong time” thing. It’s odd how people romanticize this so much, like you’re star-crossed lovers or something. We aren’t living in one of Shakespeare’s stories, this is real life. It’s not the “wrong time”, it’s the wrong person. Framing your incompatibility as the universe’s fault is just a coping method used by people who so desperately *want* a particular person to be the right one, when they just aren’t.	I found out 25 years too late that the man I was mad about also liked me. He only told me recently and it's been hard to come to terms with how different my life would have been had either of us said something as simple as, "I like you."	0
Women who are sexually active, do you believe that women are able to have sex without any emotions involved before and after the fact?	I don't think gender comes into play in this. Male or female some people just can have it empty and some people need emotions linked	Nope. Both men and women. There are always emotions involved, it's how we are wired. At the same time, humans can suppress their emotions and dissociate them.	1
Women in inter-religious marriage, what are the pros and cons of being from different religions and how you handle sensitive topics which can potentially cause conflict?	I’m an eclectic witch who practices Hoodoo as well. Fiancé is new age satanist. Not really any problem to be honest, we let each other do our thing or ask questions. As far as how to raise children, you allow them to explore, but neither of us would force religion, or just doesn’t sit well with me.	Entirely dependent on the religion and how active you are in it and how important its beliefs are to you. For example, if your religion says you need to baptize your kids as infants or they go to hell and you believe that (this is just an example) but your spouse refuses to let his/her kids be baptized in that religion, then that could cause a major conflict. For me, it ultimately didn't work out.	0
Do you think it's necessary to wash your hands after you pee at home?	I do. But realisticly, my phone is probably a thousand times more dirty than my hands after touching some toilet paper. So I do it, because it is ingrained and a good way to wash your hands a bunch of time every day, but I guess you could technically also make it part of another routine. I won't change my ways, but I think that washing my hands before I prepare food makes more sense.	Yep. I don't see why being at home would make a difference. Do you touch your genitals or wipe yourself? Wash your damn hands. Do you flush the toilet? Wash your damn hands. Do you touch doorknobs? Wash your damn hands. Seriously just wash your hands. I can't believe this is getting asked here again. So gross.	1
What's the worst/most awkward way someone has tried to seduce you?	I was waiting for a bus at a stop near a defunct Hooters restaurant, and a guy walked up to me and said “do you work here? ...you could!” Ugh.	While we were already in bed - "would it be ok if I touched your boobs? Or will it make you uncomfortable?" Mate... what the hell did you think we were going to be doing in bed together, post night-out, having spent the past few weeks flirting on nights out & the entire night stuck to each other? Made me feel so awkward and completely put me off	1
What movie or tv show actually made your blood boil?	Abducted in Plain Sight. There are so many thing wrong with the characters I regret sitting through the 90 minutes...	Logan - when they killed the entire family with the kids at the beginning of the movie I was DONE. I literally sat on my phone the rest of the movie.	1
Who is that one stranger that you still remember? Why?	I was very in tune... I sat on a bench on the oval at OSU and I was eating a carrot and I heard this voice in my head “I’m gonna go sit next to her” and I thought, okay, and then this man came and at next to me. We talked. I told him what happened. It was pleasant. I think his name was Bradley. My hearing experience was common then.	The elderly gentleman in Target when my daughter was 2 & on the verge of a tantrum. My husband had been deployed for 3 months at that time, out of a 9 month deployment, and I didn't have much patience left before my own tantrum. He gently rested his hand on top of mine & told me I was doing all the right things and to ignore the judgy looks from strangers. It was such a simple act of kindness & empathy that was enough to put me back in the right headspace to console my daughter.	0
Women who met their SO after years of being single and almost giving up, what's your story?	Why would I ever try to find someone? Seems awful. We can find each other, but until then, I'd rather be alone. I also go years and years without a relationship, so take that as you will. I'm in a relationship now after about seven years of being single. Had a quasi relationship in that time, but it was only because I got knocked up, I only wanted a few dates with the dude to relieve some boredom.	Suffered considerable trauma from an ex and was unsuccessful in finding a new relationship for ten years. Then I decided to give Tinder one more try and met my wonderful SO. It's almost like I needed to endure and experience life on my own to become the person I am now. Like they say you can't love another until you love yourself.	0
Employed Women of Reddit: On an average day how much time do you think/complain/talk about work outside of work?	I do like a 20 minute recap with my spouse. Other than that, I try hard not to bring it home.	When I started my job, a lot. Then I realized that complaining about it didn’t make me feel any better. So now on average I’d say less than 5 minutes a day. (Although if my coworkers and I go out socially that will be the bulk of our conversations.)	0
Dog/cat parents, how do you keep your home smelling good with minimal pet odor?	Two Maine Coons. Arm and Hammer litter box. Clean it twice a day if possible. There are no odors at all. They don’t get wet food and they always have a lot of fresh, clean water. That prevents problems with their urine and faeces smelling badly. More time is spent dealing with mountains of fluff. There are special brushes and products to clean that so it’s not a big deal either.	Advice from dog owner who hates cats and doesn’t have a cat: Some peoples homes smell more than others, but there’s almost always a hint of animal smell. Always keep the litter fresh, keep windows open often to get fresh air in. Vacuum and dust often. If you let your pets on furniture make sure you’re deep cleaning said furniture often. It’s better if you have a blanket that they lay on on top of the couch, that way the blanket can just go right in the wash. Also do regular frequent cleaning of your home, don’t neglect your dusting and cleaning under couches. Use candles & furniture polish to keep a fresh scent in. You can also try scented plug ins.	1
Girls who are generally unenthusiastic/low energy- how do friends/partners ever dislike it? How do you deal with it?	People think I'm mad or I dislike them when in truth, I'm just chillin and it probably has nothing to do with them. My tone or body language is more laid back and unlady-like so people assume that I'm not in a good mood or a sour pus. I just don't like making a scene or being loud.	I met a girl like this once. She talked so...monotone. It was actually quite unpleasant to talk to her even though she was saying something that was interesting I found myself losing interest. She was trying to find a job and had gone to all sorts of interviews and never got called back. I wanted to mention it to her that it was most likely because she had no voice inflection and talked like a zombie but we weren’t that close. I am sure someone had to have mentioned it to her before. I myself am overly descriptive and loud and a lot of people can take that the wrong way too lol	1
What are some good crime/drama series that aren’t focused on sexual assault (stuff like breaking bad) ???	Criminal Minds is one of my favorite shows. It's a crime drama that focuses on the psychological aspects of crimes and criminals, mostly serial killers. The crime scenes may be too intense for some viewers, but it's a very loved show by those that watch it.	Person of interest. It's about an artificial intelligence that can predict crimes. I can't think of any sexual assault situations at all. It becomes more serialized as the series goes on but I think it was handled well	0
How do you reconnect with friends after you've isolated yourself due to depression/anxiety?	Start reaching out to them in a low key way and invite them to something concrete. Send them a message like "Hey I know I've been distant lately but I'd really like to catch up, do you want to go grab a drink at the pub/coffee at x cafe/food at x place?". Don't expect too much, some people may not want to reconnect, but I suspect if they were actually your friend before they will.	fuck them... if they didn't care that I stopped contacting them they are not my friends anymore people just care about themselves or someone they can fuck	1
What common misconception within your field of expertise do you want to clear up?	That lawyers are rich. Most of us who aren't in white shoe firms are certainly not that. Also, a good amount of us fake it until directly called out. Listening to a real estate attorney talking about constitutional law can be as bat-nanners weird as say, a butcher or store clerk talking about it.	Tipping is not an option. It is customary in the United States to too tip your servers because most of them make $2.13 an hour. Tipping is what allows restaurants to serve you. Tipping is the reason your food is high quality and you get everything brought to you. Servers are already basically catering to your every need and if you don’t directly tip them you are taking advantage of someone.	1
Women who clean regularly and have consistently tidy places, please tell us your secrets?	It's not that I enjoy it... it's more like the mess stresses me out more than cleaning. I usually commit one day a week towards cleaning. Even if the apartment isn't super messy, I do little things just to keep things tidy. It also helps to have little things you do each day to maintain the cleanliness. Don't leave dishes sitting at the end of the day, put the clothes away after wearing them instead of on the floor/chair, fold blankets after using them, wipe the table after each meal, etc.	I don't enjoy doing it. It's simply part of being an adult and keeping healthy. Seemingly, being an adult isn't cool anymore. I truly can't stand other men and women who can't maintain a presentable household, budget, or cook for themselves. Jesus Christ, it's not rocket science.	1
When’s the last time you sent a text and regretted it immensely. How did you recover?	I accidentally sent a flirty and provocative text meant for just my husband to a group text with my inlaws. I quickly got a private text from my husband panicked telling me that I made the mistake of putting that in a group text. My inlaws pretended they didn't see it, but they acted a little awkward around me for a few days lmao.	I got really drunk and decided to text my crush (who was also a good friend of mine) if he wanted to hook up. Luckily, i texted “want to book hop” instead..... it forced me to just admit my feelings for him the next day and we’ve been dating ever since!	1
Women who (may be) mentally ill and in relationships, how do you avoid going overboard when asking for reassurance?	I refer to the need for reassurance as “anxiety brain.” I’m in a long distance relationship so these obsessive thoughts happen a lot. Instead of saying “you’re not going to dump me because of the distance, right?” I say: “Anxiety brain is telling me that you’ll dump me because of the distance.” We even refer to “anxiety brain” as a person. He’s an asshole It’s not my fault that I have ptsd and anxiety. So I’m going to blame that fucker for those dumb thoughts. It also helps that my boyfriend is amazing and considerate. When I say I’m worried about something, he immediately wants me to tell him the thoughts so he can shut them up. He reminds me that it’s not my fault and does everything in his power to help me ignore the obsession. Edit: added what exactly my boyfriend says.	I like to think that the person who chooses to live their life with you has accepted you for everything, even if you need excessive reassurance that everything will be alright. (There is of course a line, where strategy, therapy, and medical treatment must come into play because your partner can't be your doctor.) Mental health is an all day thing. Anxiety will come in many forms, and so does my ADHD and depressive moments. SO has his difficulties too. We just try our best to love and understand each other.	1
What food were you eating "wrong" for way too long? How did you realize what the "right" way was?	When I was a kid I would chew on the muffin paper when I was done. I don’t remember swallowing it - it was more like muffin flavored gum. Then I’d spit it out when it wasn’t sweet anymore. In my defense, my mom didn’t let us have a lot of sweets.	carbs, particularly "healthy" carbs like fruits or whole grain breads and what not. used to think it was healthy to just eat an acai bowl and loads of fruit or whole grain toast. but it has so much sugar and carbs even if we think it's just "fruit=healthy" sure it's natural, but it's not healthy to eat that much sugar. or most breakfasts, you think fruit, some yogurt maybe, some orange juice or oatmeal. if you count the carbs it's just so much sugar you might as well eat a slice of cake instead.	1
Ladies, how many of you struggle to "get off" also, any tips???	It is fairly rare that I orgasm during partnered sex. It was years before I could cum at all, honestly, years in which I found masturbation boring. I was sexually active, I enjoyed sex, but orgasm wasn't something I'd experienced. Somewhere in my mid 30, that changed for whatever reason. I don't know if it was a shift in hormones or a growing comfort with sexual fantasy or something else, but orgasm became possible, if still not easy.	Wear a pair of fitted panties, preferably cotton. Then rub your clit through them after drinking a glass of water. You'll feel the sensitive area where your clit is. Then rub it in up and down or whatever direction you want. Do it a bit fast but don't put a lot of pressure, just use medium pressure. See if it works for you. It did for me	1
What makes you NOT want to get married?	It’s frightening. The emotional and financial risks of divorce. The prospect of a partner changing in unpredictable ways that may or may not drive you apart.	Marriage is a trap. You go in thinking it's forever and love is beautiful. You bind yourself legally to one another. Then it falls apart and you have to pay enormous amounts of legal fees and go through hell just to get out of it. If I could give one piece of advice to my younger self it would be DON'T DO IT!	1
Women who practice abstinence until marriage, how do you deal with your urges?	I maintain my abstinence by fucking my life over and over again, not exactly pleasurable but it keeps me occupied not to date others.	I reminded myself that i wasn’t an animal and I had control over myself. I can see this is going to need an edit. I am not saying women/men who have sex outside of marriage are animals. I am saying that just because an urge exists, I don’t have to follow it, as an animal would. I have control of myself. I don’t have to blindly follow all urges. That’s all.	1
What is the dumbest plot hole you have seen in a story?	I get really irrationally angry at the beginning of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban movie where Harry is seen studying by using his wand for light....then minutes later he’s convinced he’ll be arrested for performing magic out of school for blowing up marge.	In Civil War, T'challa was already Black Panther after his father was killed but then has to go through the ceremony of taking a plant in the Black Panther movie to become the Black Panther.	1
What's your apartment search tip?	Look at the cars in the parking lot, if there crappy the community is crappy, if there Audi’s you can’t afford it. Look for cars that are newer but not the most expensive. These communities mean they are full of working people who care. Gross over generalization, but it always held true.	Check behind cabinets. This sounds weird, but if you can manage to spy into that little crack between the cabinets and the walls, do it. If places have pest problems they will usually spray before showing a place, but they can't get the piles of dead roaches from behind the cabinets. And roaches fucking suuuccccckkkk. Also look at the fuse box if possible and smell under sinks (for musty, moldy, standing water smell).	0
What are your life goals?	I’ve already achieved most of them (career, house, child) so now my main goal is to enjoy life and prepare for a happy retirement	• move to a country with a better quality of life and warmer climate • get a job that pays well enough for me to be able to afford my own apartment and a retirement • make that apartment the coziest place on Earth • find a better life/work balance that would allow me to spend more time at the gym, read more books and write down short stories that I occasionally come up with • travel every now and then to see more of the world • retire as a slightly eccentric, active, ridiculously healthy old lady with tons of stories to tell and hobbies to keep me busy	0
What career did you want to have when you were younger? Did you achieve this?	I wanted to be a nurse cuz that's what my mom was and then I realized what a terrible job that is (for me, not disrespect to the ppl who do it, you are much needed).	I wanted to be America’s Next Top Model. In second grade, I realized I was probably going to be too short for that, so I decided to study engineering!	0
What book are you currently reading and what do you think of it so far?	I'm in the midst of 4 books: &#x200B; 1. The Doomsday Book, by Connie Willis. She tends to plod along, but her ideas stick with me for years. Same with this one. 2. Guns, Germs, and Steel, by Jared Diamond. Mainly because I keep seeing it referenced on reddit. I'm only on chapter 1, so I have no opinion yet. 3. Here and Now and Then, by Mike Chen. I rather like it. I'm about 40% through. 4. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, by Shoshana Zuboff. My partner and I are reading it together (he chose the book). I'm about to rage-quit the internet because of this book. This gives me some extreme anxiety.	Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn. I watched the HBO miniseries before the book. So far I like the book better.	0
What was your most recent deep conversation with your SO about? Did you feel better after?	Having a child. I thought I felt better, but really we just go in circles. For some context, we’re both fence sitters. I thought we were leaning towards having one, but now I think we’re leaning against. We’ve been talking about this for a year. I just want to pick a side and be done with the conversation. Edit - words	We talked about our baby timeline last night, but it wasn't super deep. I'm so excited about it. The last deep one we had about us was last week, after an argument that lasted too long and at the end we realized we agreed with each other. We essentially argued for nothing, but that happens to us sometimes. We took a step back to explore why we talk "around" each other sometimes, and why we get so defensive that we miss what the other is *actually* saying in the moment.	1
Women who have had an unplanned pregnancy through casual sex (Fwb, one night stand, etc.), did you tell him? And how did he react?	Yes I told him. He reacted by asking me if I was going to have an abortion. I refused. I moved out of state about a month later. He called me every week during my pregnancy to check on me and the baby. After our son was born, he came to visit and I realized I had some strong feelings for him. We moved in together 4 months later and we’ve been married 14 years this year.	My friend had an unplanned pregnancy, though she was in a relationship. Her boyfriend reacted by immediately saying she'd ruin his life if she kept it and bought her a giant tub of weird pills and told her to take 8 a day so that she could have a miscarriage. She terminated the pregnancy (the right way, not through weird pills her shithead boyfriend got off of the internet. they weren't even pills intended to end pregnancy).	1
What do you think of anime?	I grew up on Yu-Gi-Oh, and have come to really enjoy shows such as Black Butler, InuYasha, Psychopass, Fullmetal Alchemist (both versions), and Parasyte. It's not that I'm a fan of "anime," per se. I simply enjoy compelling and unique storylines. Anime happens to deliver a lot of that. Plus, I do appreciate the artistic efforts of the animation. What I'm *not* a fan of is continued oversexualization of female characters, either as a fan service or as a joke. Take a newer anime - Seven Deadly Sins. The main character is shown *immediately* groping the token attractive/submissive girl, and that continues throughout the show. It's gross and I don't care for it.	Never seen it. I'm not interested in cartoons in general. That style is not visually appealing to me. I don't think most of the themes would appeal to me, either. I don't plan to give it a try, not unless a close friend really wanted me to.	1
What was the most misguided way someone tried to impress you?	I had gone to a service shop at a car dealer. When I handed my keys over to the guy at the front desk I warned him to be careful with the pepper spray on my key ring. He deliberately sprayed himself to show me how tough he was (iirc he had been in the military before) and stood there for a while as his face turned red and his eyes watered. The spray ended up getting in my throat a little and we both had to run outside.	A guy at a party kept telling me he was retired. He was like 35 tops. All I could think was what a lazy waste of space you're being, go do something! Your total lack of participation or contribution to the world we all live in is the opposite of impressive.	1
How do you feel about picking out your own engagement ring together?	I was vehemently against choosing my own ring when I got engaged. If he didn't know me well enough to pick out a ring I like, we shouldn't be getting married. The ring he chose is gorgeous, not something I would have chosen for myself but I'm reminded of him and his reasons for choosing it every time I look down 😍	I think it's a great idea to pick a ring together, that way you'll be sure that it's a ring you both like. I've heard of enough stories where someone got an awful ring 😅 Also the proposal can still be a surprise, you'll either pick out the ring later together or you'll be surprised with the ring you both picked out.	0
Ladies who look like you put a lot of effort in, but are actually very low maintenance, what are your tips?	Good skincare is more important than makeup skills. Healthy hair is more important than styling tools/products. If you don't feel like building an outfit or finding pants, just throw on a dress. A proper fit is more important than some people realize.	Probably a lot of luck. I'm naturally pretty, or at least pretty enough for people to call me that. I make sure that I condition and shampoo my hair regularly, but when I'm going out, I'll only brush it and tie it up. My skin has always naturally been smooth, I guess I drink a lot of water, so that helps keep it clear.	1
What was your experience with permanent hair removal treatments?	I got laser hair removal and it barely worked at all. After 13 sessions, I still shave my face once a week. Any laser tech that says their machine works on light hair against light skin is scamming you. If you have dark hair against light skin, laser is great, though. Can't speak for electrolysis as I haven't tried it yet	I am a destransitioning woman. I have a beard and all but I am afraid to use laser hair removal because testosterone pretty much ruined my skin.	1
A common stereotype is men 'protecting' women - but have you ever been in a situation where you 'protected' a male from something/someone? What's your story?	For as long as I can remember I considered it my job to do this for my younger brother as we grew up in a troubled household. I apparently did such a good job that he didn't know how bad things were until he was in his late teens.	Yes. I've protected my brother, boyfriends, male cousins, small male children Because that's how shit works. Of fucking course there are women who have protected men. Of fucking course there are men who have protected women. Women who have protected women. Men who have protected men.	1
What would you go back and tell your 22 year old self?	Don’t bother going to grad school for music, you’ll never have a career in it, just get a diploma in computers instead or something.	Look after yourself. Doing your best does not mean exhausting yourself to the point where you cant function. Listen to your own needs, instead of letting everyone else tell you what they are.	0
How (and why) did you and your SO choose which side of the bed you'd sleep on? Do you ever regret your decision?	He gets warmer than me so he gets the side closer to the AC. I get up more to pee (stupid bladder) so I get the side closer to the bathroom. Works out well for both of us!	After a scary incident while we were in Amsterdam, my man sleeps the closest to the door. It doesn’t matter whether we’re traveling or even at restaurants, he’ll sit facing the door so he’s aware of who comes in and out. He loves to say “I am your protector therefore, I want to make sure you are safe and for that to happen, I have to be your knight 24/7, 365 days of the year.”	1
Long time single women of reddit, what are the benefits?	I know this isn't the case for many or most long term single women but personally speaking, I've never been pestered about when I'm going to have children, and I suspect this might not be the case if I had a boyfriend.	can a long time single guy answer too? i love everything about women usually, and having a girlfriend is also very fun, i just don't really miss the fights for small things just because i or her are in a bad mood. Couples are a team not a punching bag, and that is the only thing i don't miss. all the other stuff.. pretty cool	1
Have you ever been a late bloomer's first girlfriend? How did it work out?	Yes! I was 23 and my bf was 28 and I was his first girlfriend. He’s a pretty introverted guy and according to him, it’s not easy for him to open up to people and fall in love. He’s the most gentle, caring, funny, and kind person ever! I feel so lucky that he chose me :)	When I was 18-19 I dated a friend for almost 2 years who is the same age, I was his first girlfriend. His biggest issue was that he wasn’t really close friends with anyone/ didn’t really want anyone close to him so that made it difficult to open up. Was sweet as hell and really put in time though.	1
Those who grew up in poverty, what obstacles did you face and were you able to make a better life for yourself?	A lot of things just take a longer time. I took 6 years to finish undergrad for example because i was working 40-60 hours a week in the beginning of it which really screwed my gpa the first few semesters. I also never made a lot of friends in those years because i would go to work right after class and i would have to turn down their offers to join them every time.	Budgeting. I am shit with money and spend it on shitty thing like bad food and booze/smokes. It's hard to break that habit.	1
Women who moved to another country for love, how did it turn out?	He dumped me and I found myself alone in a foreign country. My nearest family was hours away, and my entire friend circle was through him. I was completely on my own, no family, no friends, nowhere to live.	A story from a friend of mine. Men will dislike it I guess. Basically she married this dude she found online or something like that, he is from the US, moved with him, lived with him several years, then got a greencard and divorced him. Now she has a US citizenship, she moved her parents to the US, is married and has a kid with a European dude so her child has two most powerful citizenships. Smart lady.	1
What are some things that you are trying to improve about yourself right now?	Say out loud when something bothers me, giving more positive feedback to my SO, handling the rejections, defining my feminity while accepting and emphasizing it.	Two main focuses for me right now: 1. Relearning JavaScript and a new framework (react.js) to re-enter the workforce as a web developer after being a stay at home mom for 4 years. I’m nervous at finding a new tech job at 30 but hopeful! 2. Gaining better control over my emotions and strengthening my ability to not take things so personally, but rather learn and grow from criticism. This one has been really difficult.	1
What weird things has a doctor said to you regarding your body?	The gynecologist with fingers from one hand inside me and fingers from the other hand on my abdomen feelin' my organs stopped and said "Your bladder is about...halfway full". I was like "Thanks, I'll take care of that later".	While checking my cervix, my OB said “whoa girl, you are tight!” It was very uncomfortable bc she was hot and I got a little turned on?? Idk I think about it a lot.	1
What are your toxic traits?	I make funny jokes and I'm pretty witty with puns n stuff. I argue with myself so I'm pretty amusing after all aren't I?	I don't forget *anything*, and I can't let the past die. I'm actively working on remembering that sometimes the past is the past and to focus on what's in front of me right now.	0
Ladies of Reddit, what are some not often talked about problems of pregnancy? We all know about getting sick, hormonal, and getting cravings, but what else have you experienced?	"Lightning crotch" Presumably caused by the baby pressing on certain nerves toward the end of pregnancy, this a sudden stabbing pain in the vagina that can bring you to your knees. Had no idea this was a thing until I experienced it.	Food aversions. Everyone talks about food cravings like it’s a cute joke, but food aversions are more common. Imagine food suddenly smelling like trash or vomit, coupled with a very sensitive sense of smell so you can smell other people’s food a mile off. I couldn’t stand the smell of cooking oil, made the sickness so much worse.	0
Who is a woman that you admire and why?	Oprah. In addition to her obvious massive success, I think she had a tough upbringing if I'm remembering the right wikipedia profile. More importantly, I find it fascinating that to this day, not everything she does is a success. Even Oprah makes duds. But she is wildly successful and popular because she doesn't let failure stop her from trying.	Shirley Curry. She's over 80 years old and has her own Youtube gaming channel. She got a lot of nasty comments when she first started out, but she dealt with it by being her own kind, wholesome self. Now she has a great fanbase that calls her "grandma", and she calls them "grandkids".	0
What are some stupid things your SO does that you find funny?	They stand at attention when they are brushing their teeth. It’s completely unconscious and not related to their military service. Or so I assume.	As soon as he walks into a room with a window, he stands in front of it, with his hands on his hips and just looks out and continues the conversation we're having. He does it completely subconscious and when I just sit there and smile or laugh it him, he gets really embarrassed and flustered.	0
Women who cut toxic parents out of your life, when and how did you do it? What was the last straw? Do you regret it?	My dad was unhappy that my then-boyfriend came to visit me (and stay with me) when I was studying abroad. He threatened to commit violence against my boyfriend and my boyfriends family and ruin his family business. He also threatened to not continue paying for my education if I didn't break up then and there. Guess who's happily married and 100% financially independent now?	I cut my father out of my life when I was 13. He was an alcoholic who cheated on my mother and wasn’t ever really a parent to my brother and I. I sat down with him and my therapist (who I had started seeing once they divorced because I had been self harming). He started off by putting everything on my mom as he always did, always the victim and never recognized his own misdoings. I didn’t look at him and I told him that I did not want any contact with him indefinitely. I’ll be 21 this year and it is the best thing I ever did for myself and my mental health.	1
Poor &amp; Working Class Women, what are some things your middle class &amp; upper, etc friends or family just do not understand?	Ordering additional things at a restaurant and then just saying "oh, we'll split the bill". What I ordered is what I can afford. I can't afford to split the bill when you've added three more sides and another round of drinks.	They all think being a solo mother who has an above minimum wage job is fine and I should be able to rent on my own, in the city. Loving with my parents and commuting 4 hours a day is financially cheaper. It's not emotionally cheaper, I missed out on my kids first f word (it's a dark, inside joke. Welcome to the inside.) My drive to search for a partner in the past was just general loneliness... Now and for many women like me, it's a desperate drive to survive. Even if we do pay our own way.	1
What’s the shadiest thing you have done to hurt your ex’s feelings or “get back at them” during or after a breakup?	I hooked up with them again after the break up only to leave again, it wasn't too get back at them I was just lonely.	When I was 13 I sent unwanted pizzas to my ex's house. His parents came by and spoke to my dad, who grounded me and I never did it again.	0
What is the weirdest thing you do in the name of saving money?	maximise expensing things to my company. If I'm far enough from my hometown, I just switch to my company business card and let the company pay. For instance, if I'm at the service station on the motorway I'll grab something for dinner and just expense it to the company. But I could have just been on my way to/from the mall.	I dye my clothes when they start looking too worn. I don’t own many white clothes, because bleach breaks down the fabric.	0
Short women, where do you buy your pants?	I’m five feet and honestly never have a problem. I buy jeans from Topshop when there’s a sale, American Eagle, and Abercrombie & Fitch. When there’s a short option I choose it. If not, I get the regular ones and cuff them if I want to.	american eagle, they usually have "short" length pants in store and while they are pricier they last a long time and their jeans are comfortable af!!	0
What are some simple “rules” you and your partner set for a better relationship?	We thank each other for the chores we do instead of being resentful for the ones we “always” do and the other “never” does. Sometimes when I’m sweeping and vacuuming or cleaning the toilet I get all grumbly like “He never does this” and then I remember he always does the laundry and grocery shopping and that helps my grumbles.	To be honest, we haven't needed them because respect has always come naturally. We don't call each other names or insult each other during disagreements, we don't yell, we share the housework.. but none of those things were pre-planned or talked about. There is no one "his" chore or "my" chore. We just do what needs to get done as we come across it. Exceptions being things I can't do because I have no idea how.. like cleaning the outdoor pond.	1
Married/engaged ladies, after how much time spent in the relationship was it clear to you that this is the person you want to marry?	Sounds crazy, but I knew I was going to marry him after our first conversation. No specific reason, just had a gut feeling. I remember going home and telling my mom that there was a nice new guy at work and she said “boyfriend material?” And I told her “I’m gonna marry this guy”. Seven months later, he popped the question and we celebrated our ten year wedding anniversary in April Edit: major typo 😅	1 year. Everytime we thought we were done we worked it out and came out 10x stronger after. I looked back on that year and saw how much we'd both grown and knew this was something special. Were coming up on our six month anniversary in a few days.	1
What are your thoughts on seeing your engagement ring before the proposal? Would it ruin the moment when it actually happened in any way?	I’m picky, especially about jewelry, so I’d probably mention styles I like vs. styles I don’t like, and then want to be surprised. And maybe suggest people to help him 😂	My husband and I picked out the ring together. When he proposed two months later, I didn’t even see the ring; I was just so excited that he was asking! I don’t think I really looked at it until someone else asked to see it.	0
What behaviour or tropes do you often see woman characters doing in TV and movies, that you rarely ever see in person?	Women being able to sprint or hike through some kind of wilderness in heels. Specifically Jurassic world with Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard. So completely unrealistic. First of all, her heels would have gotten stuck every step in the mud and grass. Second, yes I have once or twice sprinted in heels to make a train or something, but for the whole movie for her to be running everywhere in them? She would have taken them off 30 seconds into the jungle.	* Getting ready for a date/whatever in a huge video/phone call chat situation (usually more teen/younger movies but still). Usually I’ll just send the group text like “do I look hot?” and that’s about it * Leaving work in the middle of the workday to go get lunch and like go shopping??? * 20 year olds working a 6 figure salary as an assistant at a Publisher * the 30 year old that truly believes their life is over because they haven’t found The One yet * edit: Gone into labor? Immediately full-fledged screaming pain, splashing broken water at their feet, everyone Freaking Out	0
What are some simple tips and tricks to get make getting ready in the morning go a little faster/easier?	Get a job that doesn't require a polished appearance. I'm a uniform girl through and through and I love it. I don't waste money on clothes I don't want, but have to for work and getting dressed takes a nano second. Sounds extreme, but unless you LOVE your job, why not go find something that works for YOU instead of the other way around? At least in part. And shower at night. I can't shower in the morning. i try but I just stand there for hours lol	I always prepare my clothes the night before and lay them near by bed so that when I need to, I can get dressed in under two minutes.	0
How does using a menstrual cup actually feel? Is it more convenient than pads or tampons? What are it's cons?	If it's in correctly, you shouldn't be able to feel it at all. Like a tampon. I think it's more convenient than pads or tampons because you don't have to change it for 12 hours, instead of 8. It's also eco-friendly of course. For me, the cons are that sometimes I don't want to go through the hassle of putting it in/taking it out/cleaning it, so I'll just put a pad on. But for days when I'm out at work or just not home all day, it's super convenient.	I like it, I have some leaking but overall way more convenient and comfortable. But you do have to get used to being in contact with all the blood, etc more. My sister still uses tampons because she doesn't like dealing with the blood, but I'd recommend trying out. I think they ever make disposable one's now (not so good for environment but might be cheaper for a test run).	1
Women who went through with the wedding despite having doubts, how did things turn out?	Perhaps this is very jaded of me, but I often think it's pretty normal for marriages- especially 1st marriages- to fail and that it shouldn't be seen as a bad thing. Like I often think when I hear stories like these that even if you hadn't gone through with that particular marriage, you probably still would've gone through another marriage that very well might've ended in divorce? Just because of society's expectations & people not being ready to commit for the rest of their life. And maybe your doubts would've been different & maybe your problems would've changed, but the outcome would be the same. I don't mean to be condescending. I wonder if anyone here who did end up divorced feels the same way? Or do you now believe marriage at a particular age is wrong? Or is it really just about \*who\* you get married to?	Really good, actually. I realized that it’s normal to have doubts, even if the guy is super great. It’s a huge commitment and it turned out very nicely for me. He’s an imperfect husband but he’s considerate and kind and we’re devoted to making things work.	0
Former RAs, who was the weirdest resident on your hall?	1) we had a gender neutral bathroom with one stall so naturally people had sex in it. One couple would leave the door unlocked and several of my residents and myself walked in on them several times. 2) I had one international student who would either walk into my room unannounced or bang on my door at any hour of the night and ask me to help them with their laundry 3) the boy down the hall who had a crush on my boyfriend and would try to catch him in his boxers	I used to gather the clusters of grass from the lawnmowers and put it in a zip lock back. I’d then place the bag in front of the RA desk so they wouldn’t see it but all the residents would lol. 😲	1
What's the best part of living alone?	I love going home after a busy day of work and not having to hear anyone else talk. To be able to hear myself think again, and not spend a second caring about what anyone around me wants from me, how to speak to someone, how anyone else is feeling but myself. If I want to sing and dance I can, if I want to huddle in a corner and decompress about the day I can. I don't have to try to tell anyone to leave me alone in a way that won't hurt their feelings, listen to their gossip or judgment, meet their friends, feel any way about how the chores are balanced or who's taking up how much space. If I sound like I hate people, I just might.	My boyfriend and I live together and constantly leave funny shapes in the hair on our shower wall for the next person to discover 😂😅	1
What makes someone boring to you?	If someone only goes to work and gym and rest of time watches netflix, yes they are boring to me.	People who treat a conversation only as a way of talking about themselves. Only listening to answer, never asking follow-up questions, not interested in your point of view	0
Women who wasted a lot of time in bad relationships, how did you eventually come out of the cycle and find the right one?	Why do women think that, after years of fucking your own lives over and choosing bad person after bad person, and procreating, and then leaving the mess for another man to clean up - is good practice? Why is it bad of a man to not want to date someone who already had a family and wants someone to fill a role, not be there for their actual character? Why is it good policy for women to create families, destroy them, and then wonder where all the good men are? What the fuck is wrong with women of today?	take your time when you date people. don't immediately start dating someone. stay friends for a couple of months first so you can really get a sense of them. my mistake has been instantly dating people and learning more about them during the relationship when I should've done that before we started dating. If I stayed friends for a long time before actually dating, I wouldn't have been in 80% of the relationships I've been in. Just slow down.	0
For Father's day, what's your relationship with your father like?	When I came out as trans to my parents it pretty much ruined whatever semblance of a relationship we had. My mom acts supportive but she has a problem with literally every tiny thing I do (those pants don't look good on you / You still like girls? So you're going to be a lesbian? / You're never going to look pretty so why are you going through all this?) My dad on the other hand seems to think the only reason anyone would transition is because they're gay and want to pretend they're straight so he rolls his eyes anytime I mention my girlfriend.	It's great. He's coming over tonight for dinner and gets to see our new, partially beshitted apartment. I got lucky having a supportive, caring, loving father.	0
Why was your worst date the worst?	It was at a very Christian university where he lived in an all boys dorm. He paraded me around to each room just to prove he actually brought a girl home and made a big show out of closing the door "for privacy." Proceeded to make me sit on the floor the whole time because the only seat in his room was his bed and he wasn't allowed to share a bed with a woman til marriage. Saw him again anyway 🤦🏽‍♀️	He took me to an Ethiopian restaurant (I’m all for trying new foods so it wasn’t the fact that this was something new, but extremely daring for a first date) then took me to that god-awful movie The Wolfman that came out in 2010. At the end of the date he tried to feel me up while he drove me home. I never spoke to him again after telling him that it wouldn’t work out.	1
What's the naughtiest but wholesome thing you've done?	I stole a book from a free library, bc it had bad stuff in it. I replaced it with a children’s book about superheroes.	I stole $20 from my mom when I was in 4th grade. During that same day, instead of buying cookies for myself, I gave the $20 to another kid who didn't have any lunch. I remember a couple of days before, I went in the lunch line with him and the lady gave him a PB&j sandwich because his parents weren't paying for his lunch. I remember how disappointed he was because it was pizza day. So...to see him not get any lunch at all days after, it bothered me. I knew I could have used $1 to buy cookies and given him some money. But when they give you pb&J's that means that you already have a bill that your parents haven't been paying. I don't know how much he owed the cafeteria, but I do know that I at least took off $20.	0
Black woman living outside the U.S what struggles do you face??	I'm a black Jamaican woman, living on the island. Racism isn't the problem here, but colourism is! Many older folks will tell stories of being overlooked for some jobs because of being of a darker hue than others. 'Fairer' complected women were employed in the 'high-visibility' areas such as Banking, Hotel Front Desk Staff, many other Private Sector positions and even as flight attendants on the then national airline. Nowadays, the skin- bleaching phenomenon is so prevalent here, with many people actually believing the fairer the skin, the more attractive. Thankfully, most women and men, still find black skin beautiful.	By black women do you mean African American? Or any? Edit: America is pretty much the only place I’ve heard “the angry black woman stereotype”. I’m British and there’s a lot of diversity, we don’t talk about race that often as you lot do in US. Also, I never said racism doesn’t exist in UK. But it certainly can’t be compared to that of US.	1
Why do so many people want to travel?	I feel perfectly content staying home and reading a great book! Traveling is for people who lack imagination. One of the perks you get form not traveling is fantastic skin and lack of wrinkles.	Food. I like traveling because even if you live in a pretty diverse city, there's still other foods you can't get where you live. Also, physically going to see some pretty sights that are way more amazing in-person. This one isn't far from home, but I went to a pretty big church when I was younger. It's 3 stories high. The view from the top when it was Autumn was one of the most amazing things. A snap from my phone couldn't have done it any justice.	0
Women who have has sex with women and men, were there any constant differences you noticed? What were they?	I have never had a woman be interested in anything like spitting on me or choking me, or penetrating me so hard it hurts*. As a matter of fact, with women partners I felt comfortable saying that I didn’t want to be penetrated but I was interested in X and Y, and maybe we could try Z? There was a lot of communication like “faster or slower” or “is that okay?” I don’t know, I just felt like my women partners cared about me orgasming. With men, first of all, pussy eating is only given as the beginning of a sexual encounter or as a quid pro quo for a blow job. There was no orgasm just for the sake of giving me pleasure. Sex wasn’t over until he ejaculated. I have had two good male partners and what made them good was that they really, really loved women.	For me personally being with a woman is like never ending foreplay and it doesn’t satisfy me like a man does. I still like playing with women though it’s like cute and sexy little appetizer. But with a man it’s like the entree and dessert I can’t believe I just made that analogy but that’s just how I can best describe it from my pov	1
What's the worst ending of a friendship you have experienced?	During high school, my parents and I took a month long trip to another state a few hours away and let me take my best friend who I had been friends with since 3rd grade on the trip after her parents agreed to let her go. Throughout the trip she was fine, we had fun and my parents never let her pay for any meals or toiletries she would need. Once we got back home, she immediately called her mom to pick her up and we’ve never spoken since. It’s been almost 10 years. I still don’t know what happened.	Had a friend out of the blue announce to the group she was getting engaged to an Indian man we had never met and had kept a it a secret from us all for 6 months? Oh, and announced she was moving as well. Did I mention he’s 9 years older than her and had no green card? We drifted apart after that one.	1
At what age did you find your randomly placed thicc (black) hair on your face?	Since my teens. I have a ton of blonde hair on my face too, I shave it off. It helps my skin a ton and my makeup looks better. I have black hairs on my chin that I tweeze like every freaking day lol.	This makes me laugh because I was just saying to a friend yesterday that it seems like every single woman on earth has one pesky hair on her face (usually on the chin). Anyway mine is also on the chin, just hanging out right at the bottom. I can't remember when I got it, but I think I was around 20-21? That's when I *noticed* it anyway. Also is it just me or is it incredibly painful to pluck it? My nipple hairs are lovely and soft and come out with zero pain. I can even pluck them out with my fingers sometimes. My chin hair is a stubborn wiry little bastard who hurts like hell every time I pluck him. I hate him so much.	0
What attitude of men you hate the most and why?	Men who act like all women possess the worst qualities of the woman they just broke up with/divorced. I see this in some of the strange reactions I get to things I write. If I say something about crying, then some guy will come along and say something like, "Yeah, but you don't want to see your husband crying," because his last girlfriend was emotional, but didn't allow him to be. Similarly, I see this in the type of men who say divorcing was the best thing they ever did and they'll forever be single. Not every woman is like their ex, but they're so angry they project that out into the world.	Maybe this isn’t considered an “attitude” but for me it’s when a guy knows you’re mad or upset but COMPLETELY disregards the actual reason you are upset and tries to make it into something else. I once saw a meme that summed it up perfectly. It said something like “a guy goes to chick fil-a with his ex girlfriend and when you get mad he goes “how you gonna be mad at me for eating chicken?”And ignores the fact that it’s because he went with his ex girlfriend. I’ve had that shit happen to me so many times. Like they will know I’m mad about X but then try saying why are you mad about Y? It’s infuriating.	0
Women with bigger chests, have you ever found a strapless bra that actually works and doesn't break the bank? If so, where did you find it?	Girl I just got my ass out of bed to dig it out of my drawer to tell you. Lilyette and it’s by Maidenform. I came across it at a thrift store(new with tags) and for some miracle it actually works! I won’t say perfectly, I only wear it for nights out, I couldn’t like wear it with a tank top and clean my house or do anything chest active haha but it totally holds up to a night of light dancing. If I had like a desk job I would trust it too, as long as I don’t need to bend over too much.	I would strongly suggest Triumph. Their bras are extremly high quality for a very reasonable price. I've only been buying bras from there for the past 6 years, even still wear the first one that i got around the house. They have really comfortable and supportive strapless bras in a variety of colours.	1
Those of your who live with your SO, what is your evening routine like?	We work near each other so most nights we have a drink with each other and friends before driving home together. We usually do about 20-30 mins down time talking about our day and feeding cats/doing chores once we get home and then one of us makes dinner (or orders if we’re lazy). It’s the clean up and throw on a show or movie. I always lie down and cuddle up and almost every night fall asleep on my SO’s lap. At some point he goes and puts the electric blanket on and wakes me at 11.30 to put me to bed. Mon-Thurs are pretty standard routine and I wouldn’t change it for the world.	Get home from work, work in the yard, do our dogs insulin, feed the other dogs, feed the cats, feed ourselves, say we're gonna take the dogs for a walk and don't do it, go to bed	1
Ladies who love to be alone: how did you get used to living with your SO?	we slept in the same bed together for our first semester as a couple. i learned to not mind his presence, or at least not "interpret" it the same way as the presence of others. i hope that makes sense.	Being an introvert means that other people wear me out. But the closer I became to my husband the less he was “other people” and the more he felt like an extension of myself. By the time we were living together, spending time with him around became a perfectly acceptable form of “alone time.” There’s time we spend together, and there’s time we spend in the same house.	0
What is the most valuable thing you learned in therapy?	The oxygen mask concept. Basically you have to put on your own “mask” first by improving your mental health and doing what’s best for you before you can assist others and help them with their lives. Really made me take a step back from getting involved in other people’s problems because it wouldn’t benefit me or my health.	I've learned quite a bit in my time in therapy, and one of the things that's really helped me deal with a lot of internal self-hate is just separating that as a thought of, this is not true, this is just one negative thought that doesn't outweigh the overall general and positive experiences that show otherwise. As much as I really don't like myself some days, I have to remember that and it's really helped me.	1
How was it living in a “redneck” area as a visible minority?	Might not be the exact answer you are looking for but I am white and my boyfriend is black. We live in a "redneck" area and have had many a times where we felt we had been discriminated against. That said, since we moved all of our neighbors have been really nice to us and not racist (at least in front of us)	Just the stereotypical “where are you from” “Ching Chong Ching” or “are you Chinese or Japanese?” and not knowing the huge obsession over sports.	0
How would you like to be approached by another woman? Or how do you flirt with other women?	I usually compliment her and say that I mean the compliment but I'm also totally hitting on her. I usually add that it's fine if women aren't her thing but she is so beautiful that I'd be kicking myself if I didn't at least try to ask her out.	there's a beautiful girl i like, i'd want her to turn to me in class, (i sit next to her a lot) and ask how my day was, ask if i want to go out sometime, i give her my socials ......very basic	1
What do you like and dislike about the way your parents raised you?	My parents spoiled me too much which at this point of my life sometimes can be good some others not so much. They gave me free will, which I respect, made an independent woman and have always supported my decisions. But, I am selfish and way too opinionated	I was safe, well-fed, well-educated. But I was also made very aware of my mistakes, taught not to think too highly of myself, and trained to think of myself as just a bit disappointing.	0
Women , what do enjoy the most about having your own place ?	Not having to deal with shitty roommates. I won't ever live with someone again unless I get married or have a kid.	I love living alone. Everything in my home is something I've chosen, I'm surrounded by things I love. I never have to pick up after someone else. I can always find what I need. When it comes to my home I get to make all the decisions, if I have an ugly recliner in the corner of my living room it's because I want it there. It sounds somewhat selfish, but every other area of my life requires a lot of compromises to work. At home I can do whatever I want.	0
What are some signs that you might overlook when you should leave a relationship?	When you are mocked more than you are supported. That you are mocked at all. When you are called derogatory names during an argument.	The way your partner treats their parents and siblings. This is how you can expect to be treated once you’re comfortable together.	1
Women that cut their hair drastically (think pixie cut after long/medium length hair) what is your experience? Did you like it or regret it? Did it impact how others saw you?	I LOVED it! My husband was also 100% about it and loved that I didn’t suffocate him anymore when we were snuggling! However, every other man in my life felt the need to tell me how they could never be with a girl that had short hair like mine and that got old real quick!!!	I've done this a few times. My first ex pitched a fit but besides that, I've always gotten positive reactions, even when I didn't like thr haircut myself! I've found that I love all sorts of short bobs but an actual pixie cut brings out my Indian/Jewish nose too much haha.	1
If someone is being mean to you, how often do you feel like being physically aggressive?	Depends on the mean, if a guy(or girl) is bothering me or pushing me around and getting on my nerves, I'll probably slap them. but if they're just being verbally abusive, I'll ignore it..	A lot when I was a kid. Since then I've learned to tamp it down...basically I have two modes: lose my shit or fall apart and cry. I pretty much always take the latter to avoid the former. When it's particularly personal, I feel VERY physically aggressive and really have to work to not act on it.	0
Women with the arm implant birth control, did you put on weight and if so how much?	I love mine, I’ve had two now, and I’ll get another in December when this one expires. Didn’t gain any weight or have any negative side effects.	My daughter had it and put on a lot of weight quickly. She gained 15 lbs maybe? In 6 months. They took it back out but she hasn’t lost the weight yet. All of her friends gained weight too.	1
What is something that men over complicate that is so simple to women?	Cleaning, in my experience. I know so many guys who can't just clean one thing, but every time there's "project cleaning", like cleaning out the fridge, it's a 3 hour event that they have to rope everyone in the house into. But then that may just be me pulling a trend out of a handful of people.	Putting down the damn toilet seat. Why are we having an argument over this? You put it up. You should put it down.	1
What irritates you about buying clothes and the clothing industry and how would you fix that?	Pockets is an obvious one. The other one is wildly inconsistent sizing! S/M/L, 8,10,12 they are all completely meaningless. One stores 12 is another stores 8. Then you get not only fluctuations within a store but also within the same type of clothing item and sometimes between colours of the same item 🤦‍♀️😩😖. Idk why the can’t be sized according to actual measurements!	How sexist it is. There should be clothes cut for women's bodies in the women's section that aren't feminine, tight, or skimpy. Unfortunately, the only solution is for women to demand clothes like that.	1
What's your opinion on positivity culture, or the goal of "staying positive" even when things are hard? Have you ever been told to "stay positive"? Do you think it's a helpful or hurtful approach?	Two thoughts here: Staying positive: as a personal goal is great. "Stay positive": as a phrase said to someone else is NOT great. It's generally advisable not to tell someone how *you* think *they* should feel.	To me, I’m a firm believer in the law of attraction. Although some things in life do suck, keeping a positive mental attitude makes a huge difference. I used to be super negative and think it was so cliche but it really turned my life around seeing the positive things in life when something shitty happens. I think people are so stuck in their ways though and their mental attitude they have to want to be positive telling someone to stay positive to someone who is a negative Nancy isn’t going to do anything.	1
Women with babyfaces or who don't have a naturally "dominating" demeanor -- or who have been the type no one takes seriously for some other reason -- how do you handle that? For women who have a history of not being taken seriously but have overcome it, how did you do that?	I'm nearly 29 and I'm petite and look around 16-18. I have a baby face because of my genetics and no one can take me seriously until I start writing. I know how to write and overcome that and it tends to infuriate people for some reason. They probably think I'm young and have no educated opinion, but I sure show them!	I'm a teacher, I'm 5'3, baby face, still get trouble for it (from students and parents). Honestly I'm pretty patient and I try to work around not being taken seriously by negotiating and being calm about issues, AKA act like an adult. But at work I use my superior as a backup protection - if I'm having trouble with a student or a parent, principal will have my back. I've also learned throughout the years to speak more firmly and assert myself without having to yell - although I have yelled as a very last resort. Basically I learned not to fear defending myself or assert my boundaries or enforce rules.	0
Why did you go No-Contact with your family, and how long has it been since you saw them or spoke to them?	I once went 3 months without talking to my mum. We live in the same house. Just got sick of her talking to me so i stopped responding.	They don't like me. It's really as simple as that. Every mistake I've made since birth is brought up over and over again. If I say something I'm 'too sensitive', if I don't react, they go a bit deeper. I've been in abusive relationships and these are the men my family like the most. Because they keep control of me. I finally stood up for myself this year, I'm 38, I wouldn't take this from friends so why should family be OK to do it? You get one life. Surround yourself with people who are true to you and actually care.	0
Lesbians, what is your "creepy girl" story?	Not my story but my girlfriend... This girl pinned her to the wall super aggressively trying to kiss her. My girlfriend said no numerous times and was running away from her prior to the wall pinning. Girl just wouldn’t give up. All the while the girls boyfriend was watching... clearly unicorn hunters. My girlfriend had to yell at the boyfriend to get his girl off of her.	I’m a straight dude and I’ve had problems with creepy gay dudes...? It took only once before I understood how women feel about men creepin on them. My luck with women went up ten fold...	1
What is an insecurity that you only have because somebody else pointed it out to you?	I eat *really* fast and everyone thinks it's something worth teasing me about. I don't do it on purpose, it's just the way eat. Leave me alone, please.	I used to only shave my shins, with the rationale that most people can't really see/don't notice the hair on your knees and thighs because it's thinner. Then my friend "helpfully" point out that I'd forgotten to shave my thighs. Now I'm always anxious about it. Oh and my mom pointing out my mustache was super awesome.	1
What is your favourite (or standout) memory from a romantic relationship (current or ex)? What does it feel like to remember it?	I flew to Portugal. The hostel was so run down I couldn't find it and had to ask the locals. When a handsome host opened the door, I felt like hit by lightning, immediate butterflies in my stomach. I checked in, wrapped a blanket around my shoulders because it was cold, and the host took me up the stairs to show me my room. In the middle of the stairs my blanket slipped. The host picked it up, came so close to my mouth that it felt like he was about to kiss me in a second, wrapped the blanket around my shoulders and proceeded to move up the stairs. Not sure if I have ever been more turned on than in that moment. You could feel all the unreleased sexual tension.	When he proposed. We went to the Philippines for our 5 year anniversary, while we were having dinner (at sunset on the beach) we were supposed to swap gifts - we put a price limit of like £20 because, ya know, we went the freaking Philippines as “the gift” - and he proposed. And I bought him a fucking T-shirt. So anticlimactic.	0
What is something men do thinking it will impress women but ends up backfiring badly?	Making fun of other men, or questioning the masculinity of other men in an insulting way. It's not attractive at all.	Refusing to comment on a girls appearance, even when she asks for it, because he's scared that he'll be seen as shallow and objectify her. Yeah, it's not all that matters, but damn, boy, if I ask if this top is appropriate for dinner, I want a proper answer!! Don't say yes to everything I suggest! What's also bad is the opposite, when they're too honest, and pick apart everything and whittle away every shred of self esteem the girl has. Haven't met a guy like that, (thankfully) but the first one I have.	1
How do you make peace with the fact that your life didn’t turn out the way you wanted it to ?	Wine has been useful. It helps to zone out and imagine you’re in your mansion with John Stamos making love to you when in reality you’re in a 1br apartment in the suburbs with a sweaty, balding man grunting as he thrusts and thumbs your asshole. Mmmm. Wine.	I did two things. A) I changed what I wanted to be more in line with my life today. B) I realized that what I wanted from my life would make me sad/alone in the end. My mom is very fond of saying that "Who you are when you are 10 isnt who you are when you are 25." Don't let who you were define who you should be.	0
Mothers of Reddit, were you ever worried about loss of identity associated with having kids? How did you overcome this?	I made sure to take time for me. I started doing things I enjoyed and not feeling guilty for it. Yes, I am a mother but it's only part of my identity. I let it over take me as a person and I was miserable and lost. In order to be a better mother I had to take back the other parts of my identity and embrace it. Motherhood has added to who I am, it didn't need to take over.	No. Motherhood is as integral a part of my identity as anything else I've experienced. I don't have any family in the country to help me care for my kids so I've had to just continue creating the life I want with babies and children in tow. I have no choice, I don't have the luxury of family babysitting or paying for extra care so I'm 24/7 mama - it's been a learning curve, but I do make sure that every day we do at least one thing I want to do. Whether it's dragging the babies along to a cafe for a big old coffee before we hit the beach, or trapping them in a room with me while I do yoga, I've got needs too and while I mother through my needs, they still have to get met.	1
People trying to change themselves, what are you "working on"?	Trying to work on my confidence. I know that I am competent but my anxiety is telling me I am not.	I trying to be less sarcastic and making less offensive jokes on my brother (he doesn't like them, but I usually just can't stop myself).	1
What supposed ‘beauty hack’ have you tried that actually did more harm than good?	My mom always told me that “Beauty is pain” and once I found out that I needed to hurt my body to be “beautiful” to other people’s standards, I rejected societal forms of beauty	Using baby oil instead of shave cream. I almost died trying to step out of the bathtub when I was done. I will never do Pinterest beauty hacks again.	0
Women of Reddit who didn't want to but ended up having kids, what was your experience like?	Hmm I'm the daughter of a mother who didn't really want kids or think she'd have them due to the possibility of an inherited disability. Long story short my parents saw a geneticist who said as long as they had kids before a certain age the risk was lower so they went ahead and had my sister and I as my Dad did want kids (although to be honest he just liked the idea of kids rather than the actual raising & responsibility of them). My mum used to tell me she felt cheated having us as we didn't fit into her plans or have the same interests as her. I think that people need to realise that the kids have no choice in this matter once they are born and I hate that my relationship with my parents is so poor because we weren't really wanted.	I never wanted kids and took birth control for years. I had a long term bf and he would wear condoms when I stopped taking the pill due to health reasons. Well I got pregnant. As soon as I found out I aborted. 8 months later same thing happened again. To make a long story short I had a total of 7 abortions in a 8 years period. I now have a son that is 15. The doctor told me another abortion will be very hard on my system. Reluctantly I kept this child. He is now 17 all I can say is that I wish he would have been aborted also. I guess I’m not cut out to be a mother	1
Why does it seem like society is more accepting of girls with masculine hobbies than boys with feminine hobbies?	“Girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short. wear shirts and boots because it's OK to be a boy. But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading. Because you think that being a girl is degrading.”	A lot of posts here suggest that it's because "masculinity is seen as superior". OK fine. But I think the sentence needs to go further, since "superior *at what*, exactly?" It is more accurate to say that masculinity is *more attractive to women*, and being attractive to women is what men really care about. A *lot*. If a woman is into axe-throwing or rock-climbing, it is unlikely to impact how attractive she is to men. It might even make her more attractive. If a man is into flower-arranging or knitting or does pilates, it is very likely to negatively impact how attractive he is to women. Hence, both women and men are more accepting of women with masculine hobbies, because girls can do anything. Both women and men are against men with feminine hobbies because *both* sexes think feminine hobbies make men less masculine and therefore less attractive.	1
Whats something controversial in the western culture but is completely normal in yours?	Nigerian/Lebanese- US •Childhood nudity is not controversial. •Obviously spanking kids (i don't like it personally) •Calling your elders by their first names, shouting at them etc is abnormal in mine •Using your left hand to communicate with people is considered very rude in mine • Smoking, pre marital sex, tattoos, drinking, is VERY controversial in mine. • Living with your parents is not controversial in my culture.	White people don't get why I don't just go against my mother's wishes about tattoos on my body even though I'm 31.	1
What does taking yourself on a date look like for you?	I go to tjmaxx or Marshalls and sniff all the candles. Then I go to trader Joe's and buy a small houseplant. I go home and order delivery. Then I get really high. I light one of my candles and then I figure out where to put my new house plant. Food arrives and I sit on the couch and watch really trashy reality TV. I talk out loud to the tv the entire time. Then after all that I go to my room where I watch porn and masturbate. I'm asleep by 10 and it's great.	I must be old. I have never heard of the term "taking yourself on a date". I'm not really sure what it means.	1
How do you stop yourself from crying when you feel like you're going to cry in front of colleagues etc?	Eyeballs up, deep breath in. Also, I try not to speak to anyone too much cause as soon as my mouth opens the tears flow, so, I take a bathroom break till I can pull myself together.	I don’t care how many down votes I get but to cry in front of everyone at work, just out in the open with out a care makes everyone extremely uncomfortable. I’ve worked with a lot of people who cry out in the open more then once a week or just regularly through out the month and it’s just ridiculous. Everyone can totally see you’re going through “it” as is everyone else on the planet. Trust me, I get it! I don’t want to work to pay my bills or have personal drama either. No one does. Try to cry on the inside like a winner or excuse yourself. The atmosphere you’re creating with your tears is unhealthy and toxic.	1
Have you ever been creeped out by somebody you were attracted to? What happened?	He showed up at my house in the middle of the night. He intended this to be the first time for us to meet. I never gave him my address.	He was hot and charming when I met him, but then he invited me on a weekend trip with him a day after we exchanged numbers. Stopped talking to him after that. That’s creepy.	1
What NSFW female lifestyle hack can you share?	Pussy soap is the best thing in the world for general body odor. I live in a hot and wet country, so it's easy to smell bad. Bad smell on your armpits? Put some pussy soap in your hand and scrub! (though waxing helps me with the smell). For feet it isn't that good, at least for me, so for feet instead use listerine with water and soak your feet for a while. Edit: forgot to mention to use the neutral yellow listerine. The ones with color will probably dye your feet.	When breastfeeding menstral pads are 10 times more effective to use as breast pads to avoid leaking, and 1/10th of the price! Just cut them in half to fit better in your bra	0
What has been your worst “This dude/gal is clueless” moment so far?	My husband thought that he could reveal all my sexual secrets to his family and colleagues and my family all the while painting me as hard work dramaqueen who provoked episodes of biting and beating to which I owned up for him.	I had to train one of my teenage students that it was not ok to open mouth cough on his classmates, and that it was not a good idea to blow his nose into his hand. When he asked for a tissue, I knew I had succeeded. His desk mate thanked me after a very rough winter. Kid was 14 and had no learning difficulties. He was jus clueless.	0
What's you favorite part of being an Aunt?	I love that I get to do all the fun stuff and then hand my nephew back to mom when he starts to get cranky. Absolute favorite part of being an aunt is never having to be "the bad guy."	I’m an aunt to 12 nieces and nephews. I first became an aunt when I was 15 and I’m 40 now. To be honest, I prefer it now they’re mostly older. I’ve never been a fan of babies and toddlers, so once they were over 10 years old, I got on better with them and enjoyed talking to them. Christmas is a financial nightmare though!	0
How long did you have to hide "every disgusting thing" with your SO before you were comfortable to let it all loose?	About four years into my marriage my husband and I were getting drunk on the porch arguing about gender and shit because he loves to bait me into arguments I’m passionate about. We pop into the kitchen to refill our glasses and I’m already feeling unequipped to discuss the issue further. He makes a scathing point at the sink and I look him dead in the eye and let loose a loud ass fart. Deadpan I tell him to rebut that and that’s the first time I ever farted in front of him.	I have never tried to hide it. I think I farted early on. I mean, I was classy about it but I think it's crazy to always try to be that perfect doll that doesnt poop and pee, he should accept you at a whole.	1
How did your daily routine change after moving in with your SO?	That I need to get up and get ready before his morning 20-minute long poop. We are getting two bathrooms in our next place.	She's hella horny in the mornings. So I wake up to a warm mouth on my morning wood. Wouldn't change a thing.	1
How often do people make snide remarks about your appearance while you're in public? What do they say?	No one does the only comment I could think was this guy randomly on a bus commenting how glad he wasn't my height. I'm 5'2 I'm pretty sure a ton of guys wants their girl this short apparently it's a fetish.	My entire life I have had a really red face. I get flushed very easily, so people will often ask about it. I never understood why someone would feel the need to comment on it and my face will inevitably get more red when they talk about it. Edit: you have no idea how great these comments have made me feel. I always thought I was alone with my insecurity. Now, I realize so many others struggle with a similar problem. Here’s to embracing our redness lol!	0
What’s the angriest you’ve been at a dude and why?	This guy and I had been good friends for about six years. At one point he started going through a rough time and I frequently helped him out with various things, but mostly financially and with childcare. Then one day he ghosted me completely out of nowhere. Deleted me off social media and stopped texting and everything. To this day I have no idea what the fuck even happened. All I know is that he owes me a lot of money.	When my best friend of 10+ years confessed to me that he thought it was cool to snort some coke. I was really fucking pissed.	1
If you have an air purifier in your home, what differences have you noticed in health &amp; has it been worth it?	I'm in an area that gets forest fires so it really helps to keep the house feeling fresh when outside feels like stepping into a camp fire. Outside that, it helps a lot with allergies.	I think living in a too clean environment is pretty terrible idea if you don't have any serious allergies or asthma where you would want to alleviate your symptoms. I grew up drinking boiled filtered water (my dad is OCD like that), whenever I drink any tap water I get the shits... I live in a country where the tap water is very clean to drink and everybody drinks from the tap and they are fine, not me.	1
Ladies who lift weights, whats the best/worst thing about it?	Worst: Pelvic Organ Prolapse. Ladies, if you have had a vaginal birth, be aware that not all exercises that were designed for men are appropriate for women.	Best thing: Feel strong and powerful. Seeing muscle definition. Eating more and not being underweight anymore. Worst thing: Sports and normal bras just seem to be getting tighter and I need to buy new ones often. Clothes that used to fit don't anymore. Also, hamstring doms are the worst.	0
People always say “Pick a partner with flaws you can deal with.” What’s your partner’s flaw you deal with and why is it something you are willing to look past?	Noticed lots of women (and one man?) saying their pet peeves are their man's laziness or messiness. Idk if us women should have to settle for that kind of behavior...	My boyfriend plays the guitar but over the past 6 years he keeps playing the same 5 songs. Whatever floats his boat though	0
What’s the craziest unrealistic expectation you’ve seen someone (whichever gender) have for their potential partner?	All women who expect men not to watch porn in a relationship..I don’t get it, and like why don’t you?	I know someone who wants his partner to be a specific height, but not taller than himself. He doesn't want her to be too short because then he could see her scalp which disgusts him (wtf) and not too tall because he of course thinks that guys should be taller than women. He has other stupid expectations (like no cellulite), needless to say he is single	0
Where are some safe places for women to travel alone to?	Copenhagen, Denmark was great for me. It’s a very safe country, everyone speaks English, and I often walked home from the clubs at 3 or 4 am by myself and felt completely safe.	I am a female solo traveler who has been to 45 countries including Mexico, Marrocco, Egypt, Israel, Iran, Lebanon, Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, South Africa, Turkey, and Myanmar. If you learn about the culture and how people behave and dress and what's appropriate and what is not, you can travel anywhere.	1
What’s the most creative complinsult or backhanded complement you have ever received?	“You look like a comic book character drawn by a horny teenager”. To this day I get both amused and creeped out by that phrase.	A guy at college knew I had a major crush on him, but he was into larger ladies. All the boys were talking about what they found attractive in women while we were in a group at lunch, and he singled me out and said "I'm really not into really skinny girls like \_\_\_\_". I was upset because he didn't find me attractive but as a person on a permanent diet I was overjoyed.	1
Women, have you every tried the menstrual cup, if so how'd it work for you?	Yep! I like using the diva cup. It took a little while to get the hang of it and some trial and error to get it to seal properly but now it's my go-to over tampons if I know I'll be home when I need to empty it.	I hope it's ok I comment as I'm not a woman but, my wife has 2 of the divas and swears by them now... no more cotton... I have actually seen a change in her mood ever since. Much happier and way more comfortable now. She said " omg I cant even feel it in there! ". She highly recommends them. They look crazy to me but if it works it works... no leaks either...	1
(Serious) Conventionally attractive/beautiful women of Reddit: How do you usually react to compliments about your looks? Are they so common that you're numb to them, or are you usually flattered?	I think I’m pretty, but rarely if ever do I get compliments. Does that make me unattractive? I don’t think so, but I don’t base my value on what others think. If I feel pretty, then I feel pretty (oh so pretty! I feel pretty as witty and gaaaaaayyyyy! Sorry) (not sorry). But really, the only opinion that matters is mine. I’m the only one in control of how I feel, and I refuse to feel poorly because I don’t fit into society’s standards!	If it's "you're really pretty" , I'm flattered but, I honestly forget about it soon after. So I guess you can say I'm numb to it? But if someone goes into specifics, like "You have the most beautiful big brown eyes" or something like that...I'll think about it for a while. I guess when someone puts "effort" into the compliment, that makes me feel more special.	0
Women who have given their numbers to strangers they found attractive, how did you do it and how did it pan out?	I’ve given two dudes my number. Neither called. But in all fairness, one told me he had a girlfriend and I gave it to him anyways.	I found them on dating apps, work, or going out.sometimes it panned out to just sex and ghosting, one time it panned out to be a long term relationship and another time a one night stand panned out to be chlamydia. So yeah, life’s a gamble.	0
It's peak tomato season right now. How are you enjoying the tomatoes? What have you been making?	can't tell if this is some innuendo/code I'm not getting or if this is genuinely just about peak tomato season	I made some soup. I thought it was incredible but after a while I realized I might have just made pizza sauce.	0
What was the last new-to-you food that you tried that you thought was heavenly?	I just made and tried creme Brûlée for a friends birthday this weekend. Holy god. Imma have to make many more.	Sounds so stupid but sour cream. The idea of it always grossed me out so I refused to try it. Then I ordered nachos once and forgot to tell them to leave it off and didn’t want to waste the food.. now I eat it on everything.	1
Those who are in a serious/long-term relationship but don't plan to marry, how do you explain it to people that ask why?	I don't submit to the traditional expectations of marriage and find the entire institution to be archaic, and unnecessary. When it comes to explaining it to people, nowadays (at least my environment) honesty about this doesn't feel as weird as it used to. I don't get as much judgement about it now compared to maybe 10 years ago people would scrunch their nose at me about it.	I usually make a joke about how I don't want to rush into anything since we've only just been dating for over a decade.	0
What is your ultimate, PG-rated romantic fantasy?	I would love for my SO to choose a nice dress for me while on a vacation in Florence or somewhere in Italy (I’ve always dreamt of going there) and then getting ready and going whine tasting with fancy music in the background and an awesome view of the vineyards in front of us. As the sun sets with live music, we begin to slow dance all night until we get tired. Then we get back to our hotel room and there are candles lit everywhere with rose pedals on the floor. And as I am in awe of the beauty surrounding us, I turn around to find him bent on one knee asking me to be his for the rest of his life..... ahhhh one can only dream ☺️🌸💖	Hanging out with my SO in a log cabin, light snow outside, snuggled up by the fireplace in thick blankets. We'd have some wine, cheese and a charcuterie board to share and we'd eat sitting on the floor.	0
To all the very confident women out there, what is your secret?	I only concentrate on what I'm good at, what I can be proud of. What I've accomplished so far. It can be big accomplishments like renting my own apartment, it can also be small ones like showering the day before and it can be silly ones like my giant successful colony in the game 'oxygen not included'. Whenever someone tries to put me down I remember this stuff and their insults don't hit.	My confidence comes from knowing I have a certain type of influence over men. Most men are very attracted to me due to my appearance and that is a very empowering feeling.	1
What’s your job and what’s a typical day at your work like?	I'm self employed. I typically meet with clients on Monday/Tuesday and then the rest of the week I work from home. I absolutely love being my own boss. I don't have to take jobs that aren't a good fit for me, or if it seems the client will be difficult.	Custodian. Start the work day at 3pm. Clean about 8 classrooms, take out trash, take a break. Clean another 7 classrooms, take out trash, go to lunch. Clean 2 more classrooms, 3 offices and a bathroom. Take out trash. Put my cart away. Get ready to go home by 9.	0
When you stopped looking for love and focused on yourself, what happened?	I found love. Went the same way with all of my relationships so far. Love finds YOU, when you are not looking.	Uhhhh what they always say will happen happened. I was single, not looking to mingle, just working and doing the things i enjoyed. I said sure why not to a blind date as a favor to a friend and the guy and I could NOT have had less chemistry. We had a nice dinner and then both texted our mutual friend 'thanks but no thanks.' The guy then followed up with 'But I think she would really hit it off with my best friend...' and within 18 months I was married to the best friend.	0
What did an ex say to you during an argument that caused you to break up with them?	"I leave during fights because i like watching you beg for me to come home" He had done it a hundred times at that point and id cry and beg for him to come home. He basically liked the attention, it made him feel powerful and it made me weak. The next time he pulled it I told him to never come back	boy here, she said that the guy before me had half inch fatter cock, i cried and left her and took our corgi	1
What conversation are you sick and tired of having?	my extended family (aunts/uncles) asking about my family (bro/sis/mom) who i haven’t spoken to in years. they don’t understand how much it hurts to talk about it but still bring it up and seem like I’m so comfortable talking about it	"I am sooo depresed look at me and give me so attention!" - not trivialize depresion, it's serious health issue, but most of the people who are starting this conversation (most of the people I have experience with) are just attention seeking. When I hear that someone claims that s/he has this condition I hear them out but... Hey... Most of the people who claims to be depresed don't even know what depresion is. (most of the people I have experience with)	1
How are you handling the news that if we, as a species, don't make some pretty significant (and highly unlikely) changes fairly soon, we probably won't survive much longer?	I’m taking action. I’m currently studying environmental biology and work in ecology research so I’m basically dedicating my career and life to it	I see it as a good thing. The human race doesn't deserve the planet after what we've done to it. We certainly don't deserve a new one (Mars One / Artemus Generation). We wouldn't even be alive if not for our technology, as we're not exactly ferocious attackers or even capable of defending ourselves. Heck, we're not even capability of carrying our young to term (which should be around 2 years old, except that the female body isn't capable of sustaining more than around 9 months so we end up with helpless young that need HEAPS more constant attention and care than pretty much any other animal). I don't know if we can make the changes required to keep our planet and stay alive, we're too pigheaded for that. So yeah, time for the humans to die out and to let nature take the planet back.	1
Women in long term age gap relationships (10+ years difference), when did you really feel the difference between the two of you?	I'm 10 years older than my husband (I'm 51), and we've been together 18 yrs. Honestly, I felt it for the first few months, but once we were married I stopped noticing. He looks a bit older and I look a bit younger so it's not really that obvious, and we have grown together in so many ways. He's my soulmate. I have given him instructions for my funeral, (sounds terrible I know) and he's always cracking jokes about my age and how he will finally get peace an quiet when I die lol 🙄	Not a relationship, but a close friendship. I was 12 when we met, he was 25. I never got creep vibes from him despite what you may think and in hindsight I'm still convinced he was okay. I just started noticing that we no longer shared interests. We used to bond over common interest in games and youtube, but that kind of faded. He'd always talk about shows and films he liked that I had never heard of because I didn't grow up in his time. We just drifted apart because it didn't work.	1
Women who have been in relationships for 10+ years, what are some ways your partner shows you that they're still in love with you?	Me and my fella have been together 13 years today and we try and do the following: He calls me beautiful every day, even when I'm ill He'll make sure there's food in after a long shift if he's not going to be home He's my biggest cheerleader in everything I do. He still makes me laugh like we did when we were 16years old Cooks me breakfast in bed when we are off together. Makes time for us, despite our busy and often conflicting schedules He'll dress up for dates	Not married. Or in a relationship. But I've been going through these comments and just thinking to myself "damn i guess all the good guys really have been taken from this world" Edit: I'm 16 if you were wondering	1
So in what ways did you win the genetic lottery?	I’m just super healthy and resilient. I’ve never been seriously ill, rarely catch viruses off the people around me, and when I do I fight them off very quickly. I’ve accidentally eaten expired food a bunch of times and been fine, I eat like crap and my stomach never hurts, and I have no allergies. The last time I threw up was maybe 15 years ago, and I haven’t gotten even a mild cold for 3 years. Whenever I feel down over something else genetics screwed me over with, like our family’s giant nose we all inherit, I remember and feel grateful that I have the constitution of a buffalo.	I'm white. This gives me the privilege to go through life never facing any challenges at all because of my race, and it's pretty great. I work to fight my own internalized racism, I call it out in others, and I know very well that the color of my skin is a win of a genetic lottery.	1
How do you get yourself to doing things that would be beneficial in your life if done but scare you?	Disclaimer: Man Here. Fear breeds more fear... if it'll put you in a better place, do it. This life move might only put you in a slightly better place, for now.... but if you dont go through with it, that fear will be instilled deep within. So the next life move that comes up, might put you in a hugely better place... but you'll pass on it because you're afraid, and used to being afraid. Written like hell, but you'll get the jist. Be a fearless f&%*er	I get other people involved. I suck at keeping commitments to myself, but I always keep my commitments with others.	0
Did you have a special stuffed animal as a child?	Sure do! A stuffed bear that somehow young me thought was a wolf without a tail and has round ears. Mr. Howler is currently on my side of the bed XD	I had a hippo that I loved a lot and had it for years, but I threw it out of the window on the highway for some reason and it was lost forever. Still mad at myself.	1
Marriage: Have any ladies decided it simply was not for them? What made you come to the realization?	My mum. She had a few bad experiences (nothing violent or abusive), and now she has the attitude that all men are just as bad. It really saddens me because I know it's not at all true.	Well, in the EU more than a third of children are born to parents who aren't married - in my country it's almost half. Most of those parents are in stable, long term relationships, *marriage* is just pretty optional. I was never raised to see it as anything but a practicality that might make sense, depending on your situation.	0
Ladies with sisters, how did you deal with being labeled as “the pretty one”, “the smart one”, etc.? How did this affect your relationship with your sibling?	I don't know what our given labels were, but we were both smart. In our teens I was the one in a committed relationship, didn't go to parties to drink or smoke. My sister was the opposite. She went through a somewhat "rebellious" period and it did split us up for some time. We had a lot of arguments and we were apart for a few years when I moved away after high school that helped us work past the differences.	I was the 'pretty' one until my sister survived puberty. In one summer she shot straight up, and she evened out all over and was suddenly \*stunning\*. She looks like a model and now i'm just the 'cute and funny' one. Fine by me. You people were paying too much attention to me anyway.	0
What are your observations about what parents do right and what parents do wrong when raising girls?	right; almost nothing? wrong; over sexualization, controlling behaviors, slut shaming, controlling what they can and cant do with their own body, selling them off to an adult male at the age of 12, using them as a mini parent, dumping all chores on them, etc etc	Sexualizing young girls. I teach parenting classes, and this is rampant. Examples, not allowing their daughters around the opposite gender, not allowing fathers to take part of raising the child, and having a fit if they do some child-like behavior such as running around and their underwear happen to show. I tell parents all the time, we as adults are grown and have a sexual lens of life. Children do not. And the rate that we hypersexualize our girls is really damaging.	0
Women that've experienced a healthy relationship and have also had abusive partners in the past, what differences did you notice between the two?	My ex would constantly criticize me, while my current partner encourages me to be myself. I think that’s the biggest difference I’ve noticed. I was also constantly making excuses for my ex. Now I let my SO’s actions speak for themself.	A toxic or selfish person will mostly or completely be interested in what makes them happy, a health relationship they'll care about making you happy and that will make them happy in turn because they love you. Respecting boundaries, no meaning no, not insulting you, not physically harming you, not gaslighting you making you doubt yourself or telling you no one else would put up with you/love you/treat you as well as they do/you can't do better/you're stupid/not smart/not good enough kind of crap. You should never hear any of that in a healthy relationship. A healthy partner believes in you, helps you to grow, pushes you when you need it but not in a harmful way. Supports you, is giving and not just taking.	1
Those of you who use anti-wrinkle cream, does it actually work ? How often and how long do you have to use it before seeing a result ?	I use ponds rejuvinate. It's not expensive. It was not an immediate result. But my forehead wrinkles are gone and the bottle has lasted years after daily use. I started using it because an old lady friend of mine complained that her sister looked ten times better than her and she only put ponds on her face. Shrug.	Retinol night cream has been shown to be effective, and sunscreen is of course great for day. Moisturizer is of course just great for skin in any situation. Anything else is marketing. The $300 moisturizer won’t do anything g the $10 moisturizer doesn’t do. The most important part is to use it.	0
How would you feel IRL about dating an immortal being who was 100+ years older than you, like a vampire or Time Lord?	In my opinion, in the twilight saga, Bella should have gone for the werewolf. On other hand, I guess it would be an interesting experience, it would be like having a highly misogynistic, prone to violence and racist person who would like you and expect you to have his heir or something. If they are open minded and nice you could show them the new world. Lack of hookup culture.	Can I also become a vampire? Eventually I'll be 900 years old and they'll be 1000. By then we should have stuff in common and could maybe give it a shot.	0
Women who’ve dated a “loser,” what made your ex a loser and what did you learn?	When I was 19 I was craving a major adventure (35f, now). I ended up on a remote island in northern Canada and lived in the woods off-grid. The guy I dated while there (2 years, ish) was such a loser. Like was 31 at the time I met him, so 12 years older than me. Had never finished high school. Did odd jobs for money. Was pretty bizarre looking, freakishly tall and skinny. He was a smart guy and incredible reader but really into conspiracy theories. Loved Coast to Coast AM and listened to it religiously. Was weirdly attached to his mother. Looking back, it’s just one huge cringe. I learned that I deserve better than that!	He would always say he wished he could afford to take me out on a nice date blah blah blah. He gets paid, we’re on our way to a sports bar (I’m buying) but he has to stop by his dealers house real quick to spend $100 on an ounce of weed. That was over ten years ago and I still have moments of “WTF was I thinking?” EDIT: We were on and off for a while - he broke up with me when I no longer had a car and he also cheated on me - this memory sums up the entire relationship.	0
What thing, serious or not, you don’t really like in your SO, but look past it because you love them?	His grandfather is a trump supporter and is VERY rascist, both my boyfriend and i are mexican and african. He also kills animals and has fur coats His father is a "hunter" and is very violent. On friday he grabbed my partners throat and threatened to kill him with me sitting there, ive never been more scared for my life But my actual partner is almost perfect, the only thing i dont like is his views on abortion (like he even deserves an opinion, he doesnt have a uterus;he wouldnt ever get one) and him eating meat.	*His unwillingness to see a doctor when he is sick.* Seriously, I don't get it and it's obviously bad for his health	0
How do you deal with long hair without going bonkers?	I don't. I just chopped it into a layered bob again from almost waist length. I used to have a pixie, that was fun and easy to take care of. The balls of hair I would find in my laundry drove me nuts. The shedding everywhere, the constant need for brushing, always losing my hair ties, the stupid amount of product and conditioner, the ridiculous amount of time it took to wash, the fact that I somehow lost the ability to do Dutch braids, the feel of it against my neck - all of it made me crazy.	Yes! Same question! I once had a pixie cut and once I grew it long again I could no longer eat with my hair down. I absolutely have to tie it up or it annoys me to no end	0
Why do you want to be with your current SO?	I had a horrible childhood with detached and unloving parents. Had a thing for bad boys. Got my heart broken a million times until i decided i will choose the nice guy. He made me feel safe so I married him. We have a son together now, but i dont love him anymore. Im still here because of my son.	I love everything about him, good and bad. He is an incredible, adoring, and present father to our twins. He is just so in love with being a dad that it makes my heart sing whenever he's with them. He is unfailingly kind and compassionate to all others, and he will do anything he can to help anyone who needs it. Every day he makes me laugh - we can sit and do nothing but talk for hours and I'll be laughing the whole time. I also feel loved, respected, and *valued* as an equal partner and person. He never tries to restrict or confine me, he is happy for my success and encourages me, he sees my thoughts and opinions as equally important as his, and I always feel like he sees me. He gets me. Also he can make a killer apple pie.	0
How do you stop yourself from crying in tense situations?	Tbh I try to thing about smth else but I've had times where I just keep crying ,calm down, then start crying again. I've skipped school days because of it.	Honestly? I do math. Look away from whatever is making you feel this way(esp if it’s a person- god knows looking at them doesn’t help) and pick any number at random. I usually use 400 and up, then find the square root. What’s the smallest factor you can find? Make it a fraction, how can you simplify it? Simplified it? Add them together, multiple by 13 and start over. It sounds dumb, but as someone who had to learn from a young age that crying is “a sign of weakness” this has been my saving grace. I hope it helps you. Edit: words r hard Edit 2: Silver!! I’m rich! But also, thank you stranger!	0
Have you ever been told that a romantic partner of yours harassed or abused other women while you were together? How did you find out, and how did you react?	Flip side of this: My husband's ex-wife is completely unstable. I think we were married already when she started another screaming match at a kids baseball game yelling about how terrible he is and he abuses animals and feels sorry for me. This is the kind of guy that other women are jealous of me about 😂. We've been married for three years and I've yet to see any "abuse". He's incredibly supportive. We have a farm and he takes such good care of everyone. When we had to put his horse down a week ago he cried all the way home. What a monster. Moral of the story: Don't believe everything you hear. Some women are just jealous pschos.	Kind of the reverse. The guy I dated basically emotionally abused me and would constantly put me down. He was never there for me emotionally and one time made fun of me so much over a video game that I started crying, then continued to make fun of me until he decided to just flat out ignore me for hours after I finally snapped on him. I talked to his ex before me and she had a completely different story. They dated for longer and she said that he had always treated her right consistently. He could be a little mean, she said, but was also very nice most of the time and would be there emotionally for her. I don't know why, but hearing that made me feel so much worse... Like I wasn't worthy of his love, but for some reason she was.	0
What's your worst tinder experience that led you to stop using it?	I had a scary experience when I was hooking up with this guy and he started to spank me, hard. When I asked him to stop he would just act like he didn’t hear me. I realized how far away from my home I was and how much stronger than me he was and how he obviously did not care what so ever about my well being or consent. So I just closed my eyes and let him finish, I don’t know how he didn’t notice me crying. When I left he asked if I wanted to see him again and I said I’d think about it. I was going through a difficult period in regards to my self esteem and relationship to my body, and I hate that I let myself go through that just to realize some things about myself.	This needs more exposure on twoxchromosomes or something because even though these are bad I’ve heard worse. Guys are creeps.	1
What hobbies do you have?	I crochet, cross stitch, scrapbook, garden... Basically I'm a 30 year old grandma. I like quiet hobbies where I can just happily sit and create while listening to music or Netflix or whatever. Edit: I've found my people, haha 😂 Cheers to all my fellow grandma's! Our club is officially open!	I used to have many hobbies! But now that I am growing a tiny human I mainly lay on the couch groaning from extreme morning sickness and announcing to my husband that I'm dying and that it's too hot in the house stop touching the damn thermostat	1
What is the most challenging issue women face when they have long hair?	I feel kinda privileged here. It's down to the small of my back now, almost there to my goal of the bottom of my bum. I can just put my hair above my pillow and it stays all night. It's straight and I need only brush it for a minute in the morning and at night before bed, or before I go out. The only "challenge" I have is its heavy, and I need to use multiple hair ties to keep it up in a high pony, so usually I use a low boring pony. Otherwise, for me and my hair type just letting it be long is the easy way out, it mostly takes care of itself.	In high school it was those chairs with the two buttons on top. My hair would swirl around in them and get ripped out when I would stand up. Brutal.	0
For people so lose their appetite during depressive episodes, what’s the easiest way to maintain proper nutrients and self care?	I see a lot of milk suggestions, milk is not as good for you as people say, look it up it’s filled with bacteria. Drink almond/coconut/cashew milk instead, it’s filled with vitamins and way easier on a empty stomach.	When my wife was struggling with depression, we found that if I asked her "are you hungry?" or "can I get you something for lunch?" the answer would usually be "no". But if I asked her "could you eat a banana?" the answer was usually "ok". Letting the people in your life know if there's a specific food that you often find more palatable than others when you don't particularly feel like eating can be a real helpful thing to do.	0
For the mothers- what age did you have your first child? If you could go back, would you have waited or would you have gotten pregnant earlier?	My most recent GF broke up with me because she wants a baby badly. She 43. I have a 7 yo and don’t want another, rather invited her in to my and his life but that was not enough. I think 43 is a little late to get started.	37. I only wish I had started earlier because I'll be 60 when my youngest (born when I was 42) goes to college and I'd prefer to retire earlier than 64 when he (hopefully) gets out of school. But I didn't even start dating my husband until I was almost 34 and THANK GOD I never had kids with any of my previous boyfriends.	0
What was your "I dodged a bullet" in a friendship story?	I was friends with a girl in college for a while. One of her other friends did something to make her mad and she immediately told me all of her friends’ secrets. Deep stuff that I did not need to/want to know. After that I never told her anything and we ended up not being friends because of that. Dodged a bullet.	when I first moved towns in year 5 I made two friends, barely lasted three months, didn't like me for no apparent reason, good thing in hindsight, they both do drugs and have left school, wouldn't be surprised if one of them dealt	1
What's a common or popular feature in a house you really don't like?	I'm not sure if it's a trend just where I live, but master bathrooms with no door. So many of the master bathrooms around me have the toilet in a separate room and then the sink/shower area connected to the master without a door. I hate it because if you and your partner have different schedules one is basically guaranteed to wake the other up getting ready in the morning - especially if they take morning showers. And then the whole bedroom gets hot and humid after a shower. I don't know why they're so common.	Not in the house, but the yard. I will NOT by a house with more than two trees in the yard. Leaves are freaking awful and if you don’t get rid of them, they get tracked through your house by kids, visitors, your dog, etc. If you do spend hours getting them up, a week later, your yard is covered AGAIN. Repeat every damn week for a month to months depending on where you live. Freaking hate leaves...	1
How has it been like for you living with overprotective parents?	As I look back, I’ve done well. No money, drug/alcohol, relationship problems. After being sheltered for 18 years I went to college then into law enforcement. I’ve seen a lot but kept my values to stay a good person. Some would say it sucks having overprotective parents but I appreciate it. I did not have a dysfunctional childhood like some people unfortunately do. So yeah as a teen it sucked getting my phone taken away or not being out late with boys but I’m living a good life thanks to them.	It led to a ton of anxiety as an adult. Lying became a survival skill as did my heightened senses. I can hear almost any noise at night, even when I’m sleeping. I can instantly feel when someone’s mood shifts and I will generally adapt to that shift. I ask “is anything wrong?” too frequently. Edit: guess I should clarify. This is not only for overprotective parents, this was also to survive abuse.	0
What is one thing you think more women need to hear?	You're allowed to leave situations that make you uncomfortable, you don't need anyone's permission or approval. Easy to agree with on the surface, but when put into practice it can be kind of hard to follow through with	Nobody "gives" you an orgasm. It's your body, it does it in response to internal thoughts and external stimulus. The other person is just damn lucky to have been in the vicinity for it. Also, stop letting men pay for dinner. It only leads to complicated expectations and unequal relationships. Insist on paying for him or splitting the bill. Watch what happens ;)	1
What made your day today?	I went to the second hand clothes shop because class was cancelled and I bought the biggest fluffiest jumper in the history of big fluffy jumpers and then spent the rest of the day wandering about uni like a smug oversized marshmallow thinking about how big and fluffy it was. I'm wearing it as I type this comment too and smiling because of how big and fluffy it is.	It’s only 7:55 am but this morning I got baby girl ready for school while husband gets ready for work. He had some morning farts so he let it rip and my little one was falling over laughing with her entire body. Her laugh is so contagious. When you hear her laugh, you can’t help but to laugh as well. Love mornings with my fam	1
What are the ways your partner helps you feel emotionally safe?	I'm polyamorous, and I make a point of making it *very* clear to my partner's when any relationship starts. My other ex-partners haven't dealt with this well in the past. They originally say they're OK with it, and then they blow up later on (which led to some serious mental health dips)... But my current partner is just so wonderful! He was presented with the reality of a polyamorous partner, and instead of blowing up, he took some time away to consolidate and understand his feelings, and then came back to me. This is the first time a partner has displayed emotional maturity with me. It makes me so insanely safe to talk about my own feelings with him!	Being genuinely interested and compassionate when I share my feelings with him. Validating my emotions when I try to invalidate them myself.	0
What is a hobby/pastime your partner engages in that you find incredibly attractive and wonderful?	My partner and I take psychedelics together. I find it very attractive when we do “trip” together he can compose himself. Also our conversations, i find it very attractive that he is willing to travel into the “unknown” if you will.	He can fix just about anything without having to watch a video or read a manual. It amazes me I say some random thing is broken and he just says oh ok and 15 minutes later it's taken care of and I don't have to call anybody, pay money, etc.	0
What's something someone said to you that at the time made you angry but you've since realised they were right?	My father refused to pay for college because women should be baby-makers. I had three children and then I put myself through college. He was sorta right. I prize my children way more than my degree.	My best friend since 4th grade and I had a pretty bad falling out right before we graduated. She told me all I do is talk about myself. I was so mad and we didn't talk for about 2 years. We reconnected in college as we got into the same scholars program at our university. Within those 2 years we didn't talk, I realized how right she was and decided to work on myself and try to take a step back and listen to others more.	0
How do you feel about men in women subreddits or women in the men subreddits asking or posting ?	I think it's good. Sometimes men can have some pretty interesting insights when it comes to questions regarding women. In general though, I think women should be the primary respondents.	Solely considering "ask" subreddits: Posting? no problem at all. doesn't matter who posts questions. Commenting? That's a different thing. If the majority of responeses to a question on r/askWOMEN are from men, then that defeats the purpose of the sub. Same the other way around.	0
What is something you weren't aware you were meant to be self-conscious about until an advertisement told you that you should be?	"Stress sweat smells worse than regular sweat" still does a number on me. Now, whenever I'm stressed and maybe slightly sweaty, I had the ADDED stress of freaking out that I stink!	Not really sure that ever happened to me. At least I don't remember. Maybe it's because I don't watch a lot of advertisements.	1
What do you truly regret from your 20s?	Not standing up to people/being neutral. If I felt someone was being mean, and I didn't say anything except rolling my eyes. If I saw someone in a sticky situation at a bar and didn't intervene bc "none of my business". Every time Ice stood back and done nothing I regret it. I'd rather look mental and stand up for what I believe is right, than to let things slide.	I am only 21 and I already regret not going out and party while I'm still young. But honestly I can't really be bothered. Still regret it though.	1
What do you think about being in a long-term relationship with someone who has “less ambition” than you?	I’ve dated multiple people who didn’t have as much ambition as I did and all it really did was hold me back from opportunities and things I wanted to accomplish. After I got out of those relationships and I things for myself, it showed me I want to be with someone who’s ambitious and cares about where their life is going. Contentment is one thing, stagnancy is another.	Frankly, I suspect a relationship where both people are equally ambitious would be tough. What if one career offers a transfer to another city, and the couple has to choose whose career to prioritize, whose to hurt? As long as the less ambitious person realizes that long hours are a permanent part of the package and the more ambitious one realizes they'll be picking up the financial load, I don't see a problem with a "mixed" relationship in this way.	0
Women over 50, how is being a woman today different from when you where younger?	I feel like you should ask this in a group regulated frequently by said women. Look them up! They’re usually very helpful!	I had no option but to wear skirts to school until 8th grade. I couldn't take wood shop in high school. When I joined the Navy because I couldn't find a job outside health or childcare or food service, I was not allowed on ships. Nice girls didn't get tattoos, which is why "Show him the battleship, Janet" was so funny then. I remember when date rape had no definition or recognition. I was told if I accused him of rape, he'd get his friends to say they had all had sex with me too, so no one would believe me. That actually was a thing.	0
What do you think straight porn would look like if it catered only to female pleasure?	A lot more cunnilingus that actually brings the woman to orgasm, unlike few second licks like in porn. Female centered penetration, instead of male centered one that dominates porn currently. This is grinding while penetration, not just in and out.	It already exists under the title 'Feminist Porn' it's a lot more genuine and focuses on making the woman orgasm not just make a bunch of moaning noises for the camera.	1
What strange behavior does your best friend do that you can't understand but you have to let slide?	Stands too close to people in a line. Like, breathing down their neck close. People usually get uncomfortable and give her looks; she is oblivious. Doesn't understand what the big deal is. Edit: we are Indian, so yeah, the concept of personal space is a bit wonky. But I wouldn't stand within 2-3 ft of another person, personally.	She will spend $1200 to purchase a really ugly dog from a breeder when there are hundreds of dogs that need a home locally. They’re stuck in cages and die from illnesses at the shelter or have to be put down because of over crowding. But she spends the equivalent of my house payment just to buy a dog when I foster kittens so she’s heard all kinds of horror stories from me. :/	1
What were you taught as a little girl that you will never teach your own daughter?	I remember my mother making lots of negative comments on other women's appearances, and she still does. I want to be conscious of what I say and how it might impact my daughter, if/when I have one.	You are a lady which means you know your place.. Never will i allow my daughter to feel because of her sex she has to hold her tounge and be a mother at a young age (cook and clean) that its a life skill that is nessecary. And college is a privelage. Education will be a expectation for my daughters. They will be smart enough to be succeful with their brains not becuase of who they get pregnant by.	1
Women that moved in with your partners, what made the transition easier for you? What's something you wish you knew before?	Many other people have given great advice, but I would add that you should ensure you're both on the same page on the status of your relationship and what moving in together means. To some people, moving in together is no big deal and just means that you get to spend more time with your partner. To others, it's a sign of large, serious commitment. If you're on different pages on that, you should know it. My now-husband asked me to move in with him somewhat flippantly as a convenient plan. I had to explain that I did not want to move in with a partner unless I intended to marry them. So, we waited and moved in together when we were both ready to make that commitment.	We kind of gradually started living together. He was living with his parents and I had an apt (college). He spent more time at my place, spent more nights as it became more convenient, and eventually he had all but moved in over the course of a year or two. We never really had a conversation about it, and we just started getting comfortable and spending more and more time together. I know that isn't how it is for a lot of people, but it worked pretty well for us, as we were able to work out problems as they came up overtime rather tha jumping straight into it.	1
What's an innocent remark someone made towards you that you actually found very hurtful?	I had an ex boyfriend call me Aphrodite...I was like wow dude you can’t even use my name? Idc how good u think the sex is, don’t frickin refer to me as a cardboard sex icon from a dead society’s religion....(real talk tho I love mythology, just not when he used it to reduce me to a figure)	My sister was always the cool girl growing up. Pretty face and perfect body. I was the opposite of her. Anyway this happened on multiple occasions especially with distant family we had not seen for awhile. They would look at her and tell her "Oh wow you are so pretty" then look at both of us side by side and say "Man! You two don't even look like sisters!" Didnt tell anyone it hurt my feelings. I just laughed it off. Now I'd like to think I've blossomed into a decent looking person. Only took 30 years lol.	0
What is the “pickiest” reason you had to stop dating someone?	He ate fish and chips with his hands. Culturally people eat food with their hands where he’s from and I’m from the same culture as well although less recently removed than he was, so while surprising it wasn’t entirely shocking. Either way that’s pretty much did him in.	He was so dumb. I’m so sorry he was so sweet, nice, kind, and my god he was hot, but I literally could not sit and have a conversation with him.	0
Have you ever had an experience with someone "gatekeeping" your stress levels? How do/did you deal?	Not a woman, just a dude passing by and could really relate to this in a way. I gatekeep myself essentially. I think to myself why complain about my struggles when there are others that are having it worse? Who am I to complain. So I just put up with it because it just doesn't fucking matter anymore.	My parents grew up in near-poverty, and my mom had a "when I was a kid in China..." story for every complaint I raised about school. I respect the hard work they put in to provide me a materially comfortable life, but listening would have helped a lot.	0
What mind games have been attempted on you?	broke up with me because they weren't sure if they loved me then proceeded to get jealous and frustated when i started moving on and talking to new people	I “might” come over later ... After this happened several times seeing the pattern that around 7pm he’d say “can’t make it Now” - i realised it was to keep me inside and doing nothing. Total control. Ugh!	0
Female protagonists in video games: Are there any games out there that you think do an fantastic job portraying a girl/woman in the drivers seat of a story?	Maybe this is a cheat since it's an RPG, but I think the Dragon Age games are AWESOME to play as a female character. The romance options/storylines (gay and straight) are MUCH better when you play as a woman. Same goes for the Mass Effect series. Plus the FemShep voice acting is way better than the male voice acting IMO. Life is Strange and Horizon Zero Dawn are also great.	Sorry, the way you phrased this question made me feel like I should be answering "Oh hi. This is Lara Croft. And personally, I think that the only problem with video games is how many ancient works of architectural beauty are left unexploded and unplundered."	1
What is the juiciest piece of drama at your workplace/class ?	There is a younger couple (married) that I work with. The other day she told everyone that she was taking her son out for Halloween. I sat in my car and saw her get in a different car with two other guys. One of them opened the car door for her. And she giggled laughed. Her husband has no idea.	I speak Spanish well enough to eaves drop, and the Latina cleaning ladies aren't aware of this. Last week they were talking about a lady who was pregnant and apparently she didn't mean to be. The baby daddy flaked on her and now she's left unmarried and going to be a single mom. Another lady was complaining a couple weeks ago about her daughter's boyfriend buying her daughter a puppy for her birthday, which has really become the mom's responsibility to care for. Very boring gossip, but a good opportunity to exercise my Spanish vocab.	0
Have you quit a well-paying job that crushed your soul to work in a job that paid much less/maybe entry level? What was your experience?	Yes. I took a 50% pay cut to leave my soul-sucking analyst job to work as a program manger for an education non-profit. I had to downsize my living situation and start working part time at the Gap to make ends meet, but even in light of that, I was a much happier person. I didn't find the financial aspect to be sustainable, so I actually changed careers again and am now in a completely different field that I love AND that pays well. For me, it was a much needed reset on my overall perspective on life and though short-lived was absolutely necessary and worthwhile. In my "soul-sucking" job I felt trapped doing something I hated 50 hours a week. The non profit gig helped me realize that I had some control over my life.	I took a considerable pay cut when I left my last job. My application for the current job was being processed at the time I was laid off (due to downsizing), so technically I didn't quit, but I would have even though the pay was less, because I was going from a boring, repetitive job to a creative, enjoyable one that suited my education. It took me about 3 years to get back to my old pay scale and I still enjoy the job after 9 years. Edit: The pay cut wasn't so bad that I couldn't support myself, I just needed to be more careful with my money for a while.	1
People who have broken down in public before, what happened?	Gender dysphoria. Some years before I realized I was trans, I was on a ski slope. Skiing scared me a bit, but I kept telling myself I can do this, and to "man up" and get off the bunny slope. I did, kept trying to psyche myself up in that fashion and had a dysphoria/panic attack in front of my family. That sucked.	My son was about 9 months old and we were in Target. A sweet little old lady approached him, cooed over him, said how handsome he was and generally made a fuss. She then squished his little hand in hers and said “you look like you need a grandma, I could do that.” My mom had passed away when my son was 3 months old. I went from normal to full on sobbing in about two seconds, to the point I lost a contact and smudged mascara all over this sweet little woman’s jacket.	0
How can you get yourself to be more motivated in life and do the things you need to accomplish when you are struggling from anxiety and depression?	I think a lot of recovery comes when you start doing things even when you don't feel motivated. Motivation often comes after you start accomplishing things and even if motivation never shows up, you still get the satisfaction of knowing that you can do things even when you don't want to. I have an anxiety disorder but I've realized that people without anxiety or depression still struggle and get anxious and unmotivated and the only difference between me and them was that they were doing it anyway. So I started doing it anyway.	Hi, If you are a believer in the Lord, pray all your anxiety and depression to him. Pray that your mind becomes at ease and the you open your heart to him and allow him to pour joy in your heart. &#x200B; A non-religion related answer would be to focus on your self and think about what you want for yourself. Listen to your favorite type of music and reflect on the obstacles you surpassed to be in the present today. Think about the outcome that is waiting for you after you accomplish your goals. Think about how better you will feel once you reach your goals. Vent to a friend and don't hold back.	1
Women with anger issues, how did/do you cope and calm yourself down?	When I get angry, I say everything I want to say in my head and only say it aloud only if I still think it’s a good idea 10 minutes later	I stop seeing my passion as anger. I use the strength in me, the dragon, for good. I give her space, I love her and honor that part of me. Now instead of screaming she sings.	1
Fans of Bon Appétit, how will your consumption of their material change after today's news, if at all?	I don’t care, unless they’re putting blackface in the recipes or something. I don’t follow recipes for their creators politics, I follow them for their taste.	Adam also confused Sohla and Priya in a talk... yeah. I think the whole pay thing is really shitty. Hawa, who is no longer working with BA, was only paid $400 per video. That, Alex Lau’s (old BA photographer) experience, and the race issues on/off screen proves how much BA needs to change. I’ll follow the hosts anywhere they go and they all seem genuinely invested but again... shame on BA. Edit: typo	0
What is the cutest thing that your SO has done for you and make you still smile when remembering it?	We had been married a few years and I went back to work after having our first baby. We were working opposite shifts because we didn’t have daycare and barely saw each other. I went to work at 5am and it was rough. But almost every day there would be something in my car for me. A pack of gum, a candy bar, post it with a little note, a flower. Just tiny little things that don’t mean a lot in general. But it also meant he was stopping at the store on the way home from work at 1am after working 12 hours just for me.	We just started dating and I texted him that I was going to the bathroom to poop. He said he had to poop, too but he was gunna wait til he left work. I said it would have been cool if we were “poop twins”. 3 minutes later he sent me a picture of the stall he was in. I know it’s a weird but it made me feel special :’-)	1
What makes you feel beautiful?	The stage of air drying your hair where it’s not really wet anymore, and it’s not damp, but it’s not quite all the way dry and is in fluffy, pretty waves. It’s so soft and still a little cold from the residual moisture.	My boyfriend. I’ve dated a handful of guys seriously, but it wasn’t until him that I realized how perfect I tried to be before. He loves me when I look homeless & reenact The Grinch. He loves me when”I don’t feel like showering.” He has loved & helped me through being sicknesses & surgeries. He loves me when I’m an emotional wreck. He makes me feel so confident when we are out cause he’s just so genuinely proud to be with me.	1
Women of reddit, do you believe in "you have to love yourself before you can love someone else" quote and why?	I feel that means you shouldn't make relationships (including friendships) just to validate you but it's good to make relationships that fulfill you	No, it's the other way around. The person who truly loves you with all your imperfections (can be a parent, a friend, a sinlibg, SO, doesn't matter) can show you why you deserve to be loved	1
Doctors of r/AskWomen, have you ever suspected a patient of yours was lying to you for any reason and, if so, why?	Not a doctor, but doctors ALWAYS seem to think I'm lying about my issues and I just have anxiety. Unable to breath? Anxiety (I had scaring on lungs) Fainting? Anxiety (I was deficient in key nutrients) Extreme Fatigue? Anxiety (CFS)	Patients lie literally all the time for many different reasons. A lot of times they lie because they are embarrassed about something. Other patients lie to try to get something they want (this could be something like “yes, I’m feeling much better” when it doesn’t really seem like they feel better because the patient wants to go home from the hospital or to get paperwork signed for work or many other things). Some patients are such sweethearts that they lie to make you feel better. For example some patients will lie and tell you that whatever you prescribed or recommended helped even though they didn’t do you don’t feel like you failed or something (please don’t do this, it’s really sweet but we can’t help you if we don’t know something is wrong!).	0
Mixed Race Women, what is an experience that you had due to being mixed race?	I am half Filipino half Polish. Growing up in a 100% white small town in Canada I was endlessly known as the "brown kid" or the Asian girl. Kids picked on me for the food I ate, my mom's accent, how I dressed, etc etc. But when I went back to the Philippines I was the white kid. Understandably so, my mom refused to reach me Tagalog to try to help me "be Canadian". I also was immersed in white culture despite being raised by mostly Filipinos. So I grew up feeling a weird displacement of identity. Not really white, but not really Filipino. Like I couldn't really be fully accepted into either side that I identified with. I still struggle with that feeling.	Half black/half italian - being a light skin black women, I was either too white to hang out with black people or too black to hang out with white people. People thought I thought I was better than anyone else just because I was light skin but that wasn’t the case. I was raised by my dark skinned mother and I always would wonder why I wasn’t like her. I would become friends with other light skinned black women and we would talk about our issues growing up being light skinned and we had the same experience. Saying we aren’t black, that we’re mixed. We still consider ourselves as black.	1
What is an aspect of women’s health that you feel high school health classes don’t get right or don’t focus on properly?	How easy it is to get a UTI. I was terrified when I had my first one and I honestly wish someone had told me they were a thing.	That having too many partners can cause BV or yeast infections. All that foreign and weird bacteria being introduced into your body can throw off your pH. There’s a lot of emphasis on the standard STI-prevention but not a lot on the correlation between lots of partners and vaginal infections. Condoms aren’t the ultimate safeguard against BV or candida either.	1
Asexual women of reddit- when and how did you realize and come to terms with the fact that you are asexual? How did that affect your relationship and relationships going forward?	I forget how but I came across a website describing it while in college and almost cried from relief that other people felt the same as me and I wasnt just broken. It's made me much more comfortable with my limits for physical intimacy with partners and on the flip side, I've also realized that I'm interested in people other than men as romantic partners.	I was about 12 when I first heard the word and it just made sense to me. Kept it close to my heart since. Been in a few relationships, none of which really respected my opinions of sex (nothing traumatic, just me pushing my consentually picking my battles. I decided maybe two years ago I didn’t want to keep making myself uncomfortable anymore. I’ve been single since. I hate every second of it. I’m not sure how other women or men find pride in this sexuality. I don’t think I ever will. :/	1
Women who have used online platforms to make friends (Meetup, Bumble BFF, etc.), what has your experience been?	I made one female friend online. We were friends for a good while, but she was actively dating through the app as well and would ghost me for her new partner whenever anything went past a few dates. So it didn’t last. She was a cool girl, though.	I used bumble bff for a while last summer when I moved to a new city. I realized that it's WAY harder to approach women than men. It was also pretty frustrating how sluggish the conversations were, they didn't really go anywhere and we always stopped talking after messaging back and forth a few times. Most profiles on there seemed to be inactive and a lot of them were very similar. I felt like most of the girls were just trying to get others to join their MLM schemes or gain followers on instagram.	0
How do you deal with feeling like you're behind your personal timeline?	Just wish I decided on my career and graduated at 22 instead of 25. I felt like I lost three years of great income and would be debt free and even maybe $100k in the bank right now. But I know that I was meant to take the route that I did. And if I lost out on three years then who knows how the end of those three years would have really ended.	I used to complain about this to my mum all the time until she told me there is no timeline. There’s however many billion people on the planet and we can’t all do the same thing at the same time. There’s no schedule or timeline. What’s late? What’s early? Compared to whom? Or compared to what? Wherever you are right now is exactly where you need to be and nothing is off schedule.	0
What are some LPT that make your home or life more comfortable/luxurious/relaxing?	Keeping it clean makes everything feel luxurious... Another thing I like is looking at my bookshelf, keeping that maintained makes me happy.	I like to make ‘stations’. So my kitchen has a beverage station with coffee/tea/wine made to look pretty and inviting. Also it’s nice to not have to dig around for coffee and tea deep in the cabinets. My bedroom has a reading station by the bed with my reading glasses, luxury hand lotion and book I’m reading also made to look inviting. My bathtub has a bath tray with bath salts and oils on it arranged nicely. It doesn’t take long to make a station but damn... they make my house feel like a boutique hotel. Edit: Thanks so much for the gold!	0
What are some subtle signs that someone is merely tolerating you?	Doesn't show a whole lot of interest in conversation (not reciprocating in asking questions or continuing the conversation), favors interacting with other people besides you, and doesn't make an effort to see/hangout with you.	The corner of their eyes tighten when you talk together. It's very subtle but even with a friendly expression the eyes always tighten if the person doesn't like who they are interacting with.	1
Women who’ve been married for 5+ years, how’s the sex, really?	This year will be 10 years married, 14 years together. Sex is infrequent. Besides the first year together, it’s always been like that. We’ll go through periods where we’ll have sex more often, but it’s usually about once a month. We are both highly susceptible to stress, and need long amounts of time to recharge. We are also both on antidepressants that lower our libido. We used to get really stressed out about how little sex we have, but one day, my therapist said something that really struck me. She said that if our libidos were about the same (which they are), then what’s the problem? And we realized our main stress about it was because of comparing our frequency with other people, so when we stopped doing that, things got a lot better.	Is there a reason for the experience of married couples to matter, and not the experience of long-time partners, in general?	1
Mothers of Reddit, what does a great partner for your daughter look like?	I want my daughters partners to love and respect them, and bring them joy. That’s all. Beyond that, it is entirely up to my daughters what traits are important to them.	They should be respectful, honest, supportive, ethical, and contribute to society in a positive way. I want them to have the same general goals and interests. Lastly, I would like to see her future partner not come from a divorce family simply so that her partner understands the hard work that goes into a relationship.	1
Gals who have gained weight because of quarantine/lockdown: how are you coping?	Get those gains, get dummy thick, don’t be afraid of gaining weight, turn that shit into muscle and use it as fuel. If you’re even able to get fat that’s a blessing-it means you’re eating good!	I feel horrible. I have never hated myself more. I saw myself in a picture and cried in my car.	0
How would you feel about courts mandating one year of waiting after filing/before marriage rather than one year of waiting after filing/before divorce? Would that have changed your life at all if it was the case?	There are too many variables that are grounds for divorce; some are dangerous others are mutually agreed upon. The court should only be involved in matters of safety, custody & divisions of property if needed IMO.	I don't think the courts should be involved in that. Adult people should be able to choose to marry or divorce without any required waiting period on either.	0
Do you ever feel like you're living a mediocre life? And how does it make you feel?	I bet if you asked a woman from a third world country where women don’t have property, are at risk of kidnap, rape, slavery, etc or don’t have reproductive choices, you might reconsider what a mediocre life really means.	Yes. It makes me feel pretty bad. I'm 31, and I guess as a teenager I felt like I could do anything, there were so many possibilities, but now it feels like I'm sort of coasting and haven't really achieved anything and maybe never will :(	0
Women who have climbed your way up the corporate ladder, what are things you wish you knew looking back on your journey?	I used to feel guilty asking for more money - even though I was a kick ass worker. I wish I had snapped out of that earlier.	Girl I’m an manager at Taco Bell, lemme tell you. It wadnt eassy. I had to suck up to my manager to get him to let me to become too part of the team. Very happy Now. Good results	1
Women who've taken a partner's last name when that name doesn't match your own culture/ethnicity: What has been your experience with your new name? Have you ever regretted taking it?	Kinda funny. My name is Welch - but I’m Asian. So for a long time my name didn’t match my Asian last name. And when I got married my husband had a very regal British last name, which now suited my first name - and apparently sounds quite common over in the U.K. lol. At any rate - even if we divorce I don’t regret taking the name since now it actually fits my first name despite outwardly not looking the part at all. I’d probably keep the name even after divorce.	My married last name is Hispanic. I got asked, "how did a white girl like you get a last name like that?" I really wished I could have answered them in perfect Spanish but alas I took German in high school. So I just said I got it from my husband.	0
What "superstition" do you believe in?	Celebrating something before it’s a done deal. It came from my younger days when I would do online dating. I’d talk to people through the websites and text with them but as soon as I saved their number under their name or even a description in my phone, they would ghost me. My fiancé and I are currently under contract to purchase a house and everyone keeps congratulating us. But until I’ve got the keys in my hand and my stuff in the new house, I am not celebrating shit.	Me and my sister are synced with the moon so we do which craft under the full moon. We know it won’t work but it’s still fun.	1
How does one make their dream of leaving it all behind and living in a cottage in the forest a reality?	Downsides include no electricity or running water. No refrigeration, sewer/toilet system. No way to recharge phones, no internet to post to the cottage core instas.	I remind myself that I don't like people, but I do like modern amenities. I also don't like the outdoors. Now a giant library/fortress where I could be alone and read all day....that might work.	0
Women who have dated someone only for them to choose someone else over you: how did you manage at the time, and how are you now?	I was devastated and deeply insecure at the time. It left me pretty traumatized and unable to trust people for a while. Eventually I realized it was for the best though. He wasn't that great and the person he chose over me was a better match for him. I ended up meeting my now-spouse just a few months after that breakup.	I remember dating a guy for a few months and even going away with him for the weekend. I felt like I was almost being love bombed the attention he gave me. Ultimately, he chose a woman with an illegitimate child that was just an infant. What I took away from the entire encounter was he really wanted another kid and she was his way forward. I dont for a moment think that I would have been better for him because I would have been a stepmom and I have realized since then I truly don't want that level of responsibility.	1
To all homecooks, how do you create a weekly meal plan for the family and where do you keep all your recipes/meal ideas?	They're all saved in my bookmarks on Firefox. I find recipes that I can double or triple and only require a few things that I don't have on hand, and then I pick one bulk item and build all the recipes around it. For example buy 5lb chicken breasts and all recipes based on chicken, or buy a bag of rice and base everything around rice.	I usually plan a week ahead with about 3 meals planned out and the other days being flexible. Also, I have some back-up easy meals for days I don't feel like cooking, like pre-made pesto. Over the years I've accumulated a few go-to dishes and recipes that I rotate every week. Some are recipes from the internet, some from cookbooks, some are recipes that friends and family shared with me. I'm not too great with coming up with recipes myself. I've made copies of everything and put them in an Evernote notebook in case I feel the need to look them up again. Sometimes the blogs and websites get taken down, so it's good to have backup. A lot of meals share similar ingredients because of my personal taste, so I usually have most things at home already.	0
Do you weigh yourself regularly, and how does the number on the scale affect your mood?	I've studied nutrition and always try to let everyone worried about weight know something important that isn't common knowledge... For ALL PEOPLE: depending on the food you eat (sodium levels and other factors) your weight can change by up to 5lbs (2.268kg) in a single day! This is not actual fat but just water retention falsely making you seem heavier. for WOMEN: around that time of the month, weight can change ANOTHER 5LBS (2.268kg) on top of the other food related 5lbs. That means at any given time, your weight can change and be up to 10lbs more than your actual weight IN A SINGLE DAY! this is the reason many personal trainers and nutritionist tell you to weigh yourself only once a week, first thing in the morning (after you pee, before you drink or eat anything) because it's the most accurate way to see the true +/- amount.	I stopped weighing out of laziness a couple weeks ago and oops gained 8lbs. So now I’m back to weighing every day. If I don’t see the number, I wild out.	1
Anyone who found themselves completely friendless as an adult, how did you deal with this and/or overcome this?	Gonna get flak for this but I think it's way better to have more shallow friends than those 'best friends' cause there's so many expectations out of a best friend, also do they really care anyways? I'm sure some best friends would do literally anything and always be there no matter what, but that's 1 in a 1000.	I moved a lot as an adult, and I found that the best way to make friends (outside of work, obviously) is to look into clubs/groups for things that you're genuinely interested in. Imo it's much easier to get over the initial friendship awkwardness if you have a topic to discuss that you're both interested in. I started volunteering for an animal rescue and joined a gardening club. I also cook a lot for people, so they chat and entertain each other while I cook and interject as I wish. \*Obviously most of this is on hold due to COVID.	0
Why is that one friend terrible with dating?	Thinks bumble/pof/tinder are good places to find relationships. Thinks she's in love with every guy that makes it to a second date.	She's in that life stage where she keeps trying to date douchy, emotionally unavailable partyboys and doesn't/can't see them for what they are until after several dates, if ever. She really wants to see the good in people, so much so that she completely ignores the bad. She's a very sweet, kind, compassionate person, to the point of never speaking ill of anyone, no matter what they did. She excuses terrible, douchy behaviour from dates because "they had a bad day/week/childhood/previous relationship/breakup". I love her dearly, but sweet baby Jesus on a tricycle honey, sometimes a guy is just a fucking jerk and it's okay to say that about him.	0
Calling all successful relationships with separate beds or rooms how do you make it work? How has the separate sleeping spaces impacted your relationship?	It’s really common here in Japan. A good number of couples actually have separate bedrooms, but are happily married. It’s a personal choice, IMO. If you can get better sleep in separate beds or rooms, then I don’t see any harm in trying it out. Maybe increase cuddle time/physical touch outside of bedtime to counter balance the lack of intimacy from not sharing a bed?	Used to sleep together even though my husband snores quite loud before we had a baby. The rhythm of his snoring used to put me to sleep. Since the baby we have separate rooms. He misses sleeping together. I do too but baby Needs me more. Planning on another kid so going to be separate bedrooms for quite some time. I try and wake up early some days to Cuddle in the mornings but thats rare.	1
Women of Reddit who don't have 'The Chair', what do you do with your worn but not dirty clothes?	I have a laundry basket that has two separate bins inside so I use one for slightly worn not washable yet clothes and the other side for dirty clothes. Contains it all so no piles in sight!	I fail to understand how “worn but not dirty” is a thing. If you think your clothes aren’t dirty, put them away. If you don’t want to do that, you should probably wash them.	1
Ladies of Reddit, have you been so incredibly frustrated and misunderstood that you start crying? What’s your story?	I don’t handle people yelling at me or being disappointed in me very well, and I’ve been either wrongly accused or wrongly punished many a time and have just started crying instead of saying something. People usually say something like “crying won’t make me less angry” or “yeah I bet you feel guilty”, which doesn’t help.	I’ve learnt not to break down in front of people because they perceive it as being weak...heck if I see someone start bawling because of a relatively inconsequential event (so death/accident/trauma not included) even I’d mentally ask them to get a grip. I start crying out of sheet exhaustion and frustration AFTER the incident, in the privacy of my own home, preferably under the warmth and comfort of the shower.	1
Women with long-term and/or chronic mental health issues: how do you deal with life and the struggle of accepting life?	It’s hard girl,but pray, I’ve prayed asked God for guidance and prepare my path, all the time. Don’t over think your situations. You got this	It was a lot easier before the pandemic. I really don’t see the point most days but the bills must be paid.	0
In terms of compatibility, what are some traits or habits people often forget to watch out for before deciding to enter a marriage or long term relationship?	Their open mindedness.... To anything and everything. Most importantly their open-mindedness to your opinion and whether they are willing to listen to you, while also being accepting of their own faults and flaws. Because what seemed like good conviction or beliefs or cute stubbornness before, could just as easily become rigidity and just being an asshole, unwilling to compromise or listen and entertain the possibility of them being wrong.	If they grew up with a family pet, how much of the daily responsibilities were theirs? If slim to none, don't get a dog, let alone have a kid with this person.	1
Women who have witnessed their ideas being passed over and later witnessing a man presents the same idea, and then people listen... How did you handle it?	Get better at documenting every. Single. Thing. I. Do. CYA = cover your ass. It doesn't apply to just not getting blamed for mistakes. It also helps to prove your contributions.	This happened to me when I was 10 so I kicked him in the dick later during P.E. I got in trouble for it and I didn't tell why I did it because my principal and P.E. teacher were assholes so I just accepted the punishment from them and moved on. I did tell my parents the reason though. My mom was proud but my Dad told me to find a better solution next time. Nowadays, I just don't present my ideas because if they get stolen, when I accuse the stealer everyone turns against me and blames me saying I'm the one who stole my own ideas. So, yeah that's how I do it I guess.	1
What initially attracted you to your partner?	The conversation. The first time we properly met, we just talked for about 6 hours straight. It flowed easily and we enjoyed each other's company.	Lean, athletic body, soothing voice, laid back demeanor, great dancer. I had only planned to ride him for a Summer, but decided to keep on dancing and riding.	1
What would you respond to men who make comments such as "cover up" and "have more self respect"?	No man has ever said anything like that to me. If I dressed in a way that made them notice they'd just try to fuck me.	Most of the time, ignoring them doesn't work as they take that to mean you've been shamed into silence. This is when channeling Samuel Jackson works best. "I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing."	0
